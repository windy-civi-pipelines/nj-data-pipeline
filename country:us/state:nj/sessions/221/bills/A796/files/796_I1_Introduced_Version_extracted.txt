Supplemental compensation shall be payable only at the time of retirement from a State-administered or locally-administered retirement system based on the leave credited on the date of retirement. As used in this section, "officer or employee" means an elected official; or a person appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate, or appointed by the Governor to serve at the pleasure of the Governor only during his or her term of office; or a person appointed by an elected public official or elected governing body of a political subdivision of the State, with the specific consent or approval of the elected governing body of the political subdivision that is substantially similar in nature to the advice and consent of the Senate for appointments by the Governor of the State as that similarity is determined by the elected governing body and set forth in an adopted ordinance or resolution, pursuant to guidelines or policy that shall be established by the Local Finance Board in the Department of Community Affairs, but not including a person who is employed or appointed in the regular or normal course of employment or appointment procedures and consented to or approved in a general or routine manner appropriate for and followed by the political subdivision, or the agency, authority or instrumentality of a subdivision, or a person who holds a professional license or certificate to perform and is performing as a certified health officer, tax assessor, tax collector, municipal planner, chief financial officer, registered municipal clerk, construction code official, licensed uniform subcode inspector, qualified purchasing agent, or certified public works manager. (cf: P.L.2007, c.92, s.43) 10.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends current law to make applicable for all public officers and employees the limit of $10,000 for the payment of supplemental compensation at retirement for accumulated unused sick leave and the limit on the carrying forward of vacation leave for one year only.  Current officers and employees will be permitted to retain any supplemental compensation for unused sick leave already accrued and carry forward any vacation leave already accrued as of the bills effective date. The bill would not be construed to impair the obligation of a collective negotiations agreement or individual contract of employment with relevant provisions in effect on the bills effective date.
