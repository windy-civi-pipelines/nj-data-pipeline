STATEMENT This bill revises the process for reporting lost or stolen registration plates to law enforcement agencies and the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (commission). The bill requires a law enforcement agency that receives a report of lost or stolen registration plates to provide a trackable case number that is linked to the report to the person whose registration plates have been lost or stolen, within 24 hours after a person files a report of the lost or stolen plates. Additionally, the Superintendent of State Police (superintendent), in consultation with the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (chief administrator), is required to promulgate or revise guidelines on filing police reports for lost or stolen registration plates, as appropriate, to implement this provision of the bill. The bill also amends current law to require a person whose motor vehicle has been stolen or whose registration plates have been lost or stolen to immediately file a report a with the law enforcement agency within whose jurisdiction the theft or loss occurred, rather than notify the chief of police or other peace officer as required under current law. Additionally, the bill requires the law enforcement agency who receives notice of a stolen motor vehicle or lost or stolen registration plates to take certain action rather than the chief or police or other peace officer as is required by current law. This bill also requires a person whose registration plates have been lost or stolen to notify the commission. When notifying the commission of lost or stolen registration plates, the person whose registration plates have been lost or stolen is required to submit:  (1) a copy of the police report concerning the lost or stolen registration plates or the trackable case number linked to the report; and (2) a completed vehicle registration plate status form. The commission is required to update the vehicle registration plate status form to include: (1) a space to notate if the registration plates are lost or stolen; and (2) a space for the trackable case number linked to the report. Upon completion of the form, the commission is required to provide the person reporting lost or stolen registration plates with a copy of the completed vehicle registration plate status form. With this legislation, the sponsor intends to:(1) expedite the lost and stolen registration plate replacement process; and (2) enhance law enforcements ability to track lost or stolen registration plates and prevent misuse. The bill establishes a structured and transparent process that enables individuals to obtain necessary documentation without unnecessary delays, while also ensuring that lost or stolen registration plates are properly documented. By requiring timely reporting and ensuring that lost or stolen registration plates are entered into official records, the bill helps to aid law enforcement and prevent fraudulent registrations and the unauthorized use of registration plates.
