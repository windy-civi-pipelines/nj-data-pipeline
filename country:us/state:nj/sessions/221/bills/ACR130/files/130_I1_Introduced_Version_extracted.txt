The proposed amendment does not require the Legislature to vote on every property tax legislation, or prohibit the Legislature from voting on any property tax legislation during any time other than a quarterly session. The Legislature would designate a person or entity that would have the responsibility of reviewing and certifying bills that provide property tax relief.  To be certified as providing property tax relief, the bill could not increase or impose a tax, fee, or other assessment that generates revenue and would have to effect property taxes in a positive manner for property taxpayers.  Such a bill would also have to provide for:  direct property tax relief; education spending and funding reform and unit savings; civil service reform; pension, and health care benefit, and compensation reform; shared services; local government spending and funding reform and unit savings; government and ethics reform; low-income housing mandate reform; or repeal of State mandates.
