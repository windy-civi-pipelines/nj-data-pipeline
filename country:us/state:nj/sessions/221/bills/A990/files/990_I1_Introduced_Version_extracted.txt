In addition, the bill defines authorized representative to include: (1) a licensed attorney retained by and acting under the express authorization of a person listed in the accident report or the express authorization of a person who claims to have suffered personal injury or property damage as a result of the motor vehicle accident, or an employee of such attorney, who provides written documentation demonstrating that the attorney has been retained to represent such person; or (2) the next of kin of any person whose death or incapacitation results from the motor vehicle accident.
