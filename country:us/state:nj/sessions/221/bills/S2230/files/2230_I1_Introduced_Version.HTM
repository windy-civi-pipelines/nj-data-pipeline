class=HangingAnActChar> concerning the requirement for State government
entities to provide for the translation of certain documents and services in
languages other than English and supplementing chapter 14 of Title 52 of the
Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, each State
government entity in the Executive Branch that provides direct services to the
public shall translate vital documents and information, including public
documents such as forms and instructions provided to or completed by program
beneficiaries or participants, pursuant to the provisions of this act, P.L.   ,
c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The translations
of vital documents and information shall be in the 15 most common non-English
languages spoken by individuals with limited-English proficiency in this State,
based on United States Census Bureau American Community Survey data, and shall
be relevant to services offered by each State government entity. The Department
of State shall update the list of 15 languages every year or every five years,
upon the release of the American Community Survey data. The translations
required under this section shall be implemented on a rolling basis and shall
be completed no later than one year after the effective date of this act for
the five most common languages, not later than two years after the effective
date of this act for the next five most common languages , and not later than
three years after the effective date of this act for the remaining five most
common languages, except that applications, notices of rights, or privacy
protections shall be translated immediately.  If an application or form has not
been translated as required by the provisions of this act, the State government
entity or contractor shall provide oral translation of the application or form
and a certification by the limited-English proficient individual indicating
that the application or form was translated and completed by an interpreter. 
The State government entity shall make all reasonable efforts to provide
language assistance services in person by bilingual personnel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Cultural competence means
and includes the understanding that different populations and communities are
impacted differently by historical bias, racism, and other forms of
discrimination and stigmatization.  Cultural competence also includes
self-awareness of how ones own needs, values, practices, and verbal and
nonverbal communication styles may impact others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Interpretation means the
oral translation of information from one language into another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Limited English Proficiency
means that a person speaks, reads, writes, or understands the English language
less than very well, in accordance with Census Bureau data, and as
self-reported by that person to the State government entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     State government entity
means any State department or agency in the Executive Branch and any
commission, board, bureau, division, office, or instrumentality thereof
providing direct services to the public. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Translation means the
conversion of written words from one language to another in a manner that
conveys the intent and essential meaning of the original text and
communication.  Translation does not mean the use of automatic electronic
translation services. Translation may include professional translation
software, provided the State government entity conducts a quality control to
ensure that the software has correctly translated the documents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      Vital documents means
documents that affect access to, retention of, termination of, or exclusion from
program services or benefits; which are required by law; or which explain legal
rights. Vital documents include, but are not limited to: applications;
consent forms; complaint forms; intake forms; letters or notices pertaining to
eligibility for services or benefits; and letters or notices pertaining to
rights or to the reduction, denial, or termination of services or benefits or
that require a response from the person who has limited English proficiency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  Each State government
entity in the Executive Branch shall provide interpretation services between
the entity and an individual in that persons primary language with respect to
the provision of services or benefits. Each State government entity shall have
the option to provide interpretation services in the manner specified in the
entitys language access plan, which may include in person by a qualified
interpreter, interpretation by phone, or video interpretation services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each State government entity
shall prepare an informational poster for use and display at each service
location in an area that is highly visible<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>
</span></b>to the public seeking services or benefits.  The poster shall
describe the language interpretation and translation services available and a
persons right to receive those services under this act, P.L.   , c.   (C.    )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The poster shall include the
same information in, at a minimum, the 15 most common non-English languages
spoken by individuals with limited-English proficiency in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  Each State government
entity in the Executive Branch shall publish a language access plan that shall
reflect how the entity will comply with the provisions of this act, P.L.   ,
c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and document all
progress since it last submitted a language access plan.  The State government
entity shall issue the language access plan required by this section within 180
days of the effective date of this act, and shall update and publish the plan every
two years thereafter. The State government entity shall also post the language
access plan on the entitys website. The State government entity shall consult
with community or stakeholder entities representing limited-English proficient
populations in drafting and updating the plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Each language access plan
shall set forth, at a minimum:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   when and by what means
the government entity will provide or is already providing language assistance
services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   how the government
entity intends to keep track of the limited-English proficient population
requesting interpretation and translation services, and  how the government
