If you are opposed thereto make a cross (X), plus (+) or check (a) in the square opposite the word "No." b.    In every municipality the following question: CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE STATE SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ON EQUAL PER  PUPIL BASIS YES Do you approve amending the Constitution to change the way that the State funds public schools? Do you approve amending the Constitution to require that State funding to school districts, other than special education funding, be on an equal per pupil basis? INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This amendment to the Constitution changes how the State provides funding for public schools.  The amendment would require that any State funding provided to school districts be provided on an equal per pupil basis.  This requirement would not apply to special education funding.  Currently, State aid per pupil varies significantly among school districts. The amendment specifies that the State would not be required to provide a minimum, nor does it establish a maximum, amount of funding to school districts. STATEMENT This Assembly Concurrent Resolution proposes a constitutional amendment to specify that State aid payable directly to school districts, other than funding for special education, would be provided on an equal per pupil basis.  The amendment also specifies that the State would not be required to provide a minimum, nor does it establish a maximum, amount of funding to school districts.
