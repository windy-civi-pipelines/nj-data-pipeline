Each State agency shall develop and maintain a written plan for the initiative to continually improve service delivery, including minimum response times for telephone, written, and in-person inquiries and services.  Each plan shall set forth the customer service standards for that State agency and shall incorporate recognized best practices for providing excellent customer service under those standards.  Each State agency shall complete a plan by the first day of the sixth month following the effective date of this act, P.L.     , c.        (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and shall review annually, and modify if necessary, its plan.

These metrics shall be made available to the public on the website of the Department of State. d.    Each State agency shall display the Customer Service Promise prominently in State agency offices and on agency websites.  The Customer Service Promise shall be a series of key principles that will serve as basis of all interactions between State employees and their customers.  The promise shall state that the agency is committed to providing the best possible customer service to the public and shall serve as the basis of all interactions between State employees and customers.  The promise shall state that the State agency pledges to provide constituents, businesses, customers, and stakeholders with services in the following: (1) friendly and courteous manner that is helpful and supportive and with a positive attitude and passion for what the agency does; (2) timely and responsive manner that is proactive, takes initiative, and anticipates customer needs; (3) accurate and consistent manner that will always aim for 100 percent accuracy and be consistent in how the agency interprets and implements State policies and procedures; (4) accessible and convenient manner that will continue to simplify and improve access to information and resources; and (5) truthful and transparent manner that will advance a culture of honesty, clarity, and trust. The display of the promise on each agency website shall be followed with a section to permit customers or members of the public to submit a comment on their experience with the agency and a section to permit customers or members of the public to complete a three question customer experience survey. Immediately below the display of the promise, comment, and survey, the State shall provide the annual reports on the customer service initiative. e.     Each State agency shall implement appropriate employee recognition and award programs to highlight exceptional customer service to help further encourage a philosophy of outstanding service delivery.  The Governor, or the Governors designee, shall meet with employees who are agency award recipients at the State House to offer congratulations and appreciation to the employees who have consistently provided exceptional customer service.

STATEMENT The residents of the State of New Jersey expect the best possible customer service from their State government.  The Statewide customer service initiative established by this bill will ensure continued improvements across all State agencies by giving our State employees the leadership, guidance, training, and the tools they need to provide excellent customer service. This bill is based on a program established in the state of Maryland. This bill requires each State agency to develop a written customer service improvement plan as well as customer service standards.  The plan is required to be developed by the first day of the sixth month following the effective date of this act.  The plan is required to be reviewed annually, and modified if necessary.
