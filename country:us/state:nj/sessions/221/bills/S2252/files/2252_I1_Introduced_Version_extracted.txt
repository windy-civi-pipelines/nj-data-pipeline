(pending before the Legislature as this bill), except that the rules and regulations shall not include any zero emission vehicle requirement that exceeds the zero emission vehicle requirement in effect in the State as of November 1, 2023.  The department may provide for incentives and other market mechanisms to increase the number of zero emission vehicles driven in the State in the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection. (cf:  P.L.2003, c.266, s.3) 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would direct the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to adopt rules and regulations, within one year after the bill's enactment, to implement the current low emissions vehicle program in California, the latest amendments to which are colloquially known as the "Advanced Clean Cars II" program, with the exception that the bill would prohibit the DEP from adopting any rules or regulations to increase the zero emission vehicle requirement (i.e., the percentage or number of zero emission vehicles that are required to be delivered by a manufacturer for sale or lease for the applicable model year), beyond the level in effect in the State as of November 1, 2023.  The bill would authorize the DEP to include, in the rules and regulations, incentives and other market mechanisms to increase the number of zero emission vehicles driven in the State. The bill would also clarify that "California Low Emission Vehicle program," as used in sections 1 through 7 of P.L.2003, c.266 (C.2C:2C-8.15 et seq.), refers to the California low emission vehicle program as a whole, and not merely to the second phase of that program.  The second phase was adopted by the California Air Resources Board in 1999.
