(2)   A case manager or case manager's supervisor in the department who fails to report an act of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an individual with a developmental disability while having reasonable cause to believe that such an act has been committed, shall be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree, unless the abuse, neglect, or exploitation results in the death of an individual with a developmental disability, in which case the case manager or case manager's supervisor shall be guilty of a crime of the third degree. d.    In addition to any penalty imposed pursuant to this section, a person [convicted] who fails to comply with reporting obligations under this section shall be subject to a civil penalty imposed by the department in the amount of $350 for each day that the abuse, neglect, or exploitation was not reported, payable to the [Treasurer of the State of New Jersey, which shall be used by the department to fund the provision of food and care to individuals with developmental disabilities residing in community care residences] Residential Facility Quality of Care Improvement Fund established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). e.     A case manager or case manager's supervisor, or a caregiver suspected of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an individual with a developmental disability, who is charged with failure to report an act of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an individual with a developmental disability while having reasonable cause to believe that such an act has been committed, shall be temporarily reassigned to duties that do not involve contact with individuals with developmental disabilities or other vulnerable populations, and shall be terminated from employment if convicted. In the case of a case manager or case manager's supervisor, or of a caregiver suspected of abuse, neglect, or exploitation who is employed by the department, the case manager, supervisor, or caregiver shall retain any available right of review by the Civil Service Commission. (cf: P.L.2017, c.238, s.9) 5.  The Department of Human Services shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations as necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act. 6.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the sixth month next following enactment, except that the Commissioner of Human Services may take anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill enhances the enforcement authority over developmental disability service providers, and establishes the Residential Facility Quality of Care Improvement Fund in the Department of Human Services (department). The department possesses licensing authority pursuant to N.J.A.C.10:44A-1.8 et seq. to take negative licensing actions against noncompliant providers, such as issuing written warnings, halting admissions, issuing provisional licensing, revoking licenses, and assigning a quality management team. This bill expands that authority to impose financial penalties.  The Office of Program Integrity & Accountability in the department licenses providers of residential services to adults with developmental or intellectual disabilities, while the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the department authorizes payment to providers of services to adults with developmental or intellectual disabilities through contracts and a fee-for-service system. Under the bill, the department is to have the authority to license authorized providers and licensed providers, as both of these terms are defined in the bill. The bill provides that any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association operating a provider-managed residential setting without a license when a license is required is to be subject to penalties.  Any licensed provider that has been granted a second consecutive provisional license is to be subject to a penalty Any authorized provider or licensed provider is to be subject to penalties provided for in the bill if the provider:  (1) employs or fails to remove from employment a person who has been placed on the Central Registry of Offenders Against Individuals with Developmental Disabilities or included on the child abuse registry; (2) fails to conduct an initial or biannual criminal history record background check; (3) fails to meet the requirements of drug testing for controlled dangerous substances; (4) receives a substantiated finding from the Office of Investigations of a violation outlined in the bill; (5) fails to conduct an adequate internal investigation of an allegation of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an individual with a developmental disability and submit a complete report to the department within 180 days of the date of the alleged incident; (6) fails to submit an approved plan of correction to the department upon the completion of an investigation closed by the Office of Investigations, or (7) is assigned a Quality Management Team by the department. The bill also amends current law to grant the department authority to impose civil penalties for individuals who violate reporting obligations under P.L.2010, c.5 (C.30:6D-75), rather than penalties being imposed once that person is convicted of a disorderly person offense. Finally, the bill amends section 3 of P.L.2010, c.5 (C.30:6D-75) and establishes the Residential Facility Quality of Care Improvement Fund in the department.
