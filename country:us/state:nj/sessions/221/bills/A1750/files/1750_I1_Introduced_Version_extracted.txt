(cf: P.L.2008, c.50, s.21) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill creates the new offense of theft by financial exploitation of vulnerable person.  Under the bill, an actor commits this offense when, being in a position of trust in relation to a senior citizen or a person with a disability, he commits a theft offense against that person.  The bill amends N.J.S.A.2C:20-1 to define a senior citizen as a person 62 years of age or older.  A person with a disability means a person who by reason of a pre-existing medically determinable physical or mental impairment is substantially incapable of exercising normal physical or mental power of resistance, and includes, but is not limited to, a person determined to be disabled pursuant to Title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.ss.401-433 or 42 U.S.C.ss.1381-1383), or any other governmental retirement or benefits program that uses substantially the same criteria for determining eligibility. Further, a "person in a position of trust" means a person who: (a)   is the parent, spouse, adult child, or other relative by blood or affinity of a senior citizen or person with a disability; or (b)   is a joint tenant or tenant in common with a senior citizen or person with a disability; or (c)   has a fiduciary obligation to a senior citizen or person with a disability; or (d)   receives monetary or other valuable consideration for providing care for a senior citizen or person with a disability; or (e)   lives with or provides some component of home care services on a continuing basis to a senior citizen or person with a disability including, but not limited to, a neighbor or friend who does not provide such services on a compensated basis but has access to a senior citizen or person with a disability based on such relationship. The bill provides that theft by financial exploitation of a vulnerable person shall be graded as a crime of the fourth degree if the underlying offense is a disorderly persons offense or petty disorderly persons offense. Otherwise, it is a crime one degree higher than the most serious underlying theft offense.
