<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     24.  This act shall take
effect immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends and
supplements the statutes concerning the homestead property tax benefit program,
the homestead property tax reimbursement program, and the Stay NJ property tax
credit program in order to implement the recommendations of the Stay NJ Task
Force.  The statutes controlling the homestead property tax benefit program
also provide statutory authority for the Affordable New Jersey Communities for
Homeowners and Renters (ANCHOR) Property Tax Relief Program established by the
Fiscal Year 2023 Appropriations Act. The proposed changes to these statutes are
intended to align the various administrative and eligibility requirements
methods for these programs in order to provide for the efficient implementation
of property tax benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <i>Age and Residency
Requirements.</i>  Current law establishes a different statutory residency date
for qualification under each property tax relief program.  In order to provide
consistency in these dates, the bill amends current law to require an eligible
claimant to be a resident of New Jersey as of December 31 of the year for which
a benefit is sought.  The bill also requires senior citizens participating in
each program to be age 65 as of December 31 of the benefit year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <i>Application Process and Timeline.</i>
Current law establishes different application timelines for each property tax
relief program.  The bill amends current law to provide that the period during
which an eligible claimant may submit the combined property tax relief
application will run from February 1 through October 31 of each year.  The bill
also requires the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the
Treasury to promulgate a single combined application, to be used for all three
programs, by no later than February 1, 2026.  To the extent practicable, the
bill requires this single combined application to resemble the application
currently used for the homestead property tax reimbursement program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <i>Benefit Calculation.</i> 
The bill alters the method for determining the amount of an eligible claimants
Stay NJ property tax credit.  Current law entitles an eligible claimant to the
greater of the Stay NJ property tax credit or the combined amount of the ANCHOR
property tax rebate and the homestead property tax reimbursement.  The maximum
Stay NJ property tax credit is 50 percent of an eligible claimants property
tax bill, not to exceed a maximum amount of $6,500 in tax year 2026, with
annual adjustments based on the annual increase in the average residential
property tax bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, if the sum
total of an eligible claimants homestead property tax reimbursement and ANCHOR
property tax rebate exceeds the lesser of 50 percent of their property tax bill
or the maximum benefit amount, then the eligible claimant will not receive an
additional Stay NJ credit.  If the combined amount of the homestead property
tax benefit and ANCHOR property tax rebate is less than the Stay NJ benefit
amount, then the eligible claimant will receive a Stay NJ property tax credit
equal to 50 percent of their property tax bill, not to exceed the maximum
benefit amount, less the sum total of their homestead property tax reimbursement
and ANCHOR property tax benefit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <i>Benefit Distribution.</i> 
Under current law, eligible claimants receive benefit payments under each of
the property tax relief programs at different times.  The bill requires the
sequential distribution of property tax benefits in accordance with a statutory
schedule, with the homestead property tax reimbursement provided beginning in
July, ANCHOR property tax rebates provided beginning in September, and the Stay
NJ property tax credit provided beginning in November.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, current law
requires a Stay NJ benefit to be provided as a credit against an eligible
claimants property tax bill.  The bill allows benefits distributed through
each of property tax relief program to be provided through check, direct
deposit, or as a property tax credit.  The bill allows municipalities and the
Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to share unredacted
property tax information for the purpose of calculating and distributing
property tax credits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <i>Calculation of Income.</i> 
Under current law there are different methods of calculating income to
determine eligibility for the homestead property tax reimbursement and the Stay
NJ property tax credit.  For the homestead property tax reimbursement, income
is determined based on an eligible claimants total income, including income
that is excluded in gross income under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act,
N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.  For the Stay NJ property tax credit, income is
determined based on an eligible claimants gross income, which does not include
income that is excluded from gross income under the New Jersey Gross Income
Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes a uniform
definition of income for purposes of determining eligibility for the homestead
property tax reimbursement and the Stay NJ property tax credit.  Under the new
definition, an eligible claimants income will be determined using gross income
plus income from the following sources that are excluded from income under
current law:  (1)  all payments received under the federal Social Security Act;
(2) pension and annuity income; (3)  interest income; (4) other retirement
income; and (5) distributions from a Roth Individual Retirement Account.  Since
Social Security payments are excluded from gross income and not reported on
annual gross income tax returns, the bill requires eligible claimants to report
those amounts when they apply for property tax benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>     Budgetary Surplus Target.</i> 
Current law establishes the maintenance of a budgetary surplus of 12 percent of
total expenditures from the General Fund and Property Tax Relief Fund in a
given State fiscal year as one of the prerequisites for funding and
implementing the Stay NJ property tax credit program.  Total expenditures from
the General Fund and Property Tax Relief Fund are usually not quantifiable
until publication of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report for each fiscal
year.  In order to establish an identifiable and measurable amount for
determining whether the budgetary surplus target is satisfied for each fiscal
year, the bill requires the maintenance of a budgetary surplus of 12 percent of
total appropriations from the General Fund and Property Tax Relief Fund.  Total
appropriations from the General Fund and Property Tax Relief Fund are
calculated and published in the annual Appropriations Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <i>Gross Income Tax Deduction
for Property Taxes.</i> Current law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $15,000
from gross income for property taxes paid in a tax year.  According to guidance
published by the Division of Taxation, taxpayers are not required to deduct
property tax relief payments from the amount of property taxes deducted from
gross income.  In order to prevent taxpayers from deducing from their gross
income property taxes they did not pay due to the receipt of a property tax credit,
the bill amends current law to clarify that amounts deducted from gross income
will be limited to the property taxes paid by the taxpayer, as opposed to the
amounts billed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <i>Program Administration.</i> 
The bill requires the Director of the Division of Taxation, in consultation
with other State and local officials, to develop a process for the payment of
benefits provided through the homestead property tax reimbursement program and
the Stay NJ program as property tax credits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the
Stay NJ Task Force to continue to meet monthly to assist the Director of the
Division of Taxation in developing this process and collecting information from
local officials regarding how to effectively implement property tax credits in
future years for those programs.  Under current law, the task force would
otherwise be required to disband 30 days after the enactment of this bill.</p>
