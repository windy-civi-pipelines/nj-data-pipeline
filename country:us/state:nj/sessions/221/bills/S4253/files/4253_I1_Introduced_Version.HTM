class=HangingAnActChar> establishing the Artificial Intelligence Innovation
Partnership to promote certain emerging technology businesses and
supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  The Legislature
finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) Artificial intelligence technology
is now being used in a wide variety of industries, including healthcare,
finance, retail, and manufacturing, and is becoming increasingly common in
other businesses as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  As innovations in the
field of artificial intelligence technology continue, it is important for this
State to promote and fund emerging businesses who develop or implement
artificial intelligence technology in various industries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The Legislature therefore
determines that, to be a leader in the field of artificial intelligence
technology, it is vital to provide opportunities of collaboration between
emerging artificial intelligence technology businesses, nonprofit organizations,
and private and public institutes of higher education and to provide funding for
research on artificial intelligence technology within this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The Legislature further
finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Beatrice Hicks, born in
Orange, New Jersey in 1919, was one this States most successful and important
scientists and engineers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   by the age of 13, after
being inspired by the newly built Empire State Building and George Washington
Bridge, Ms. Hicks believed her calling was to become an engineer;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   a graduate of Orange
High School and the Newark College of Engineering, now known as the New Jersey
Institute of Technology, Ms. Hicks went on to be the first woman engineer
employed by Western Electric, where she pioneered the theoretical study,
analysis, development, and manufacture of sensing devices, developed
long-distance telephone technology, and invented a crystal oscillator that
generated radio frequencies used in aircraft communications;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   after working as an
independent consultant, Ms. Hicks assumed several leadership roles at her
fathers company, the Newark Controls Company;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Ms. Hicks served as
vice-president and chief engineer, and eventually president, of the Newark
Controls Company, where she developed environmental sensors for heating and
cooling systems that were later used in the United States space program; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Ms. Hicks co-founded the
Society of Women Engineers in 1950 after recognizing the lack of support and
encouragement women received to pursue an education in engineering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Legislature
therefore determines that, in honor of Ms. Hickss trailblazing and independent
spirit, her innovations and leadership in science and engineering, and her
consciousness of the support needed to foster a community of innovators, this
partnership shall be established.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,

(pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Artificial Intelligence

(pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Artificial intelligence
technology or AI technology means any technology involving the development
or implementation of machine-based systems that, for explicit or implicit
objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as
predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that may influence physical
or virtual environments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commission means the New
Jersey Commission on Science, Innovation and Technology established <span
style='color:black'>pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1985, c.102 (C.52:9X-3)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Emerging AI technology
business means a company that is doing business, employing or owning capital
or property, or maintaining an office in this State, and has qualified research
expenses paid or incurred for research conducted in this State, conducts pilot
scale manufacturing in this State, or conducts technology commercialization in
this State, in the field of artificial intelligence technology or artificial
intelligence related field, as determined by the commission.</p>
