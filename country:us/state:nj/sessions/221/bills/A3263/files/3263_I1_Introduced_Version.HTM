Housing Act and amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='line-height:
150%;font-variant:small-caps'>Be It Enacted </span></b><i><span
style='line-height:150%'>by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New
Jersey:</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  This act
may be known and may be cited as the Safe Sanitary Rental Housing Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    Too many residents of
the State of New Jersey are currently residing in substandard rental housing,
which fails to meet minimum standards of safety and sanitation;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Landlords should be held
accountable and should be required to provide safe and sanitary housing
accommodations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    Existing laws concerning
registration of landlords are too lax and allow landlords to skirt
responsibilities to their rental housing units and tenants, creating a dangerous
environment for tenants, as well as the other members of the communities in
which the rental housing units are located; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Therefore, it is in the
public interest that the State revise and expand upon current law governing the
obligations of landlords to their tenants, in order to reinforce to landlords
that the safety and security of their tenants is of paramount importance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  a.  In
any action before the court in which a resident tenant asserts a warranty of
habitability violation by the landlord, the court shall determine whether the
landlord receives a rental subsidy.  If it is determined by the court that
failure to pay rent was due to a violation of the warranty of habitability of
the premises, the court shall direct the deposit of the tenant portion of the
rental payments with a court-appointed administrator for use in remedying
defective conditions, in accordance with the provisions of P.L.1971, c.224
(C.2A:42-85 et seq.).  The Department of Community Affairs, or housing
authority, as the case may be, shall have discretion to withhold any portion of
the rental subsidy until a reinspection determines every violation has been
remedied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    (New section)  No
judgment of possession shall be entered for any premises covered by section 2
of P.L.1974, c.49, (C.2A:18-61.1), unless the landlord has been registered,
pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28), for at least 90 days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    Section 2 of P.L.1974,
c.50 (C.46:8-28) is amended to read<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Every landlord shall,
within 30 days following the effective date of this act, or at the time of the
creation of the first tenancy in any newly constructed or reconstructed
building, file with the clerk of the municipality, or with such other municipal
official as is designated by the clerk, in which the residential property is
situated, in the case of a one-dwelling unit rental or a two-dwelling unit
non-owner occupied premises, or with the Bureau of Housing Inspection in the
Department of Community Affairs in the case  of a multiple dwelling as defined
in section 3 of the &quot;Hotel and Multiple  Dwelling Law&quot;  (C.55:13A-3),
a certificate of registration on forms prescribed  by the Commissioner of
Community Affairs, which shall contain the following  information:</p>

the record owner or owners of the premises and the record owner or owners of
the rental business if not the same persons.  In the case of a partnership the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If the record owner is a

officers of said corporation.</p>

issue receipts therefor and to accept service of process on behalf of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Too many residents of the
State of New Jersey are currently residing in rental housing units that fail to
meet minimum standards of safety and sanitation.  Landlords should be held
accountable for the health and safety of their tenants with respect to their
housing, and should be required to provide safe and sanitary housing
accommodations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Accordingly, this bill
implements various changes to State rental housing laws in the areas of
landlord registration requirements, inspection of multiple dwellings, warranty
of habitability, and distribution of certain information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><u>Warranty of Habitability</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 3 of the bill provides
that in any action before the court in which a tenant asserts a warrant of
habitability violation by a landlord who accepts a rental subsidy, the court is
required to notify The Department of Community Affairs (DCA) within two
business days. Upon notice to DCA, the Bureau of Housing Inspection (BHI) is
required to inspect the property within 10 days. A hearing to determine
violation of the warranty of habitability may not be set by the court prior to
the completion of the inspection by the BHI.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If it is determined by the
court that failure to pay rent was due to a significant violation of the
warranty of habitability of the premises, the court will direct the deposit of
the tenant portion of rental payments with a court-appointed administrator for
use in remedying the defective condition. The State or public housing
authority, as the case may be, will retain the discretion to withhold any
portion of the rental subsidy until a reinspection by BHI determines every
significant violation has been remedied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7
address issues related to registration of landlords. Current law requires
landlords to register with the municipality in which the rental premises is
located, or with DCA, depending on circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 4 of the bill
prohibits the entering of a judgment of possession by any court for a premises
covered by section 2 of P.L.1974, c.49 (C.2A:18-61.1) unless the landlord has
been registered for at least 90 days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under section 5 of the bill,
landlords are required to include the following additional information in a
landlord registration:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  in the case of a record
owner that is a corporation, limited liability company, or other legal or
commercial entity, the names and Social Security numbers of residence of the
members, directors, officers, and registered agents, as applicable; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  for each person required
to be named in the registration   a telephone number where someone can be
reached at all times; a street address of residence; and an active email
address.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 5 also requires that a
landlord who accepts rental subsidies may not be granted State funding, or a
tax abatement or exemption, for rehabilitation of a premises unless the
landlord has been registered for at least 90 days.  Rental subsidy is defined
as funds paid to a landlord pursuant to federal project-based or tenant-based
federal Housing Choice Voucher (section 8) Program rental assistance or paid as
a rental assistance grant pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2004, c.140
(C.52:27D-287.1).</p>

landlords to annually certify, by July 1, that the certificate of registration
is accurate, and contains current information.</p>

regulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the provisions of
section 9 of the bill, within 30 days of the most recent inspection of a hotel
or multiple dwelling, the owner must file with the commissioner an application
for a certification of inspection, together with the required fee.  A
certificate of inspection and the fees would not be required more often than
the schedule of inspections set by the commissioner pursuant to section 8 of the
bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 10 of the bill
pertains to significant violations found following an inspection or

associated health impacts; structural deficiency; or any other condition that
the commissioner may, by rule, identify as a significant violation, that does
not constitute an imminent hazard, and which is not caused by, or within the
control of, the tenant.)  If a significant violation is found following an
inspection or reinspection, the commissioner must notify, if applicable, the
public housing authority that operates the multiple dwelling within 48 hours of
the inspection or reinspection.  In the case of a multiple dwelling that
participates in federal section 8 housing, the commissioner must notify the
Department of Housing and Urban Development New Jersey field officer of the
complaint and violation.  If the commissioner determines as the result of an
inspection of a hotel or multiple dwelling that one or more significant
violations exist, the written order served on the owner must identify each
violation.  If an application for a hearing is filed pursuant to section 18 of
P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-18), the hearing shall be held within 30 days of the
receipt of the application, and the commissioner must render a final decision
within 60 days of the date of the hearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 11 of the bill
requires the commissioner to establish a program to assist municipalities in
making inspection records and landlord information records available to the
public on the Internet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 12 of the bill
requires that the commissioner must promulgate regulations to effectuate the
provisions of the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law, P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1
et seq.) pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act,
P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 15 of the bill
requires that every landlord post in every common area of a tenant-occupied
multiple dwelling, and include in a printed notice in the lease, instructions
on how to file a tenant complaint with the BHI, and instructions on how to
access and use the instructions on how to access and use the comprehensive
social services information toll-free telephone hotline service, established
pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.524 (C.30:1-1.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><u>Eviction Proceedings</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 13 of the bill
requires that if a landlord enters any information into a shared database
concerning eviction proceedings brought against a residential tenant for
non-payment of rent, the landlord must include the following information, which
shall be permanently attached to the tenants record in the database:  (1)
whether a finding was made on the record that the non-payment of rent was due
to a violation of the warranty of habitability of the premises; and (2) the
disposition of the proceedings.  A landlord or an owner of the shared database
who violates this requirement will be liable to a penalty of $500 for each offense.</p>
