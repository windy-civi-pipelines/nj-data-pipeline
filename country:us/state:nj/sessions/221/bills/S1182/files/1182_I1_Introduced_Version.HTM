<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 21 of P.L.1946,
c.138 (C.40:14A-21) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     21. (a) In the event that a
service charge of any sewerage authority with regard to any parcel of real
property shall not be paid as and when due, interest shall accrue and be due to
the sewerage authority on the unpaid balance at the rate of 1 1/2 percent per
month until such service charge, and the interest thereon, shall be fully paid
to the sewerage authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   In the event that a
service charge of any sewerage authority with regard to any parcel of real
property owned by any person other than the State or an agency or subdivision
thereof shall not be paid as and when due, the unpaid balance thereof and all
interest accruing thereon shall be a lien on such parcel.  <u>No interest shall
be charged on unpaid sewerage service charges attributable to the State or a
local unit, or any of their agencies and authorities, including, but not
limited to, a housing authority.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Such lien shall be superior
and paramount to the interest in such parcel of any owner, lessee, tenant,
mortgagee or other person except the lien of municipal taxes and shall be on a
parity with and deemed equal to the lien on such parcel of the municipality
where such parcel is situate for taxes thereon due in the same year and not
paid when due. Such lien shall not bind or affect a subsequent bona fide
purchaser of such parcel for a valuable consideration without actual notice of
such lien, unless the sewerage authority shall have filed in the office of the
collector or other officer of said municipality charged with the duty of
enforcing municipal liens on real property a statement showing the amount and
due date of such unpaid balance and identifying such parcel, which
identification may be sufficiently made by reference to the assessment map of
said municipality. The information shown in such statement shall be included in
any certificate with respect to said parcel thereafter made by the official of
said municipality vested with the power to make official certificates of
searches for municipal liens.  Whenever such service charge and any subsequent
service charge with regard to such parcel and all interest accrued thereon
shall have been fully paid to the sewerage authority, such statement shall be
promptly withdrawn or cancelled by the sewerage authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   In the event that a
service charge of any sewerage authority with regard to any parcel of real
property shall not be paid as and when due, the sewerage authority may, in its
discretion, enter upon such parcel and cause the connection thereof leading
directly or indirectly to the sewerage system to be cut and shut off until such
service charge and any subsequent service charge with regard to such parcel and
all interest accrued thereon shall be fully paid to the sewerage authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   In the event that a
service charge of any sewerage authority with regard to any parcel of real
property shall not be paid as and when due, the sewerage authority may, in
accordance with section twenty-six of this act, cause the supply of water to
such parcel to be stopped or restricted until such service charge and any
subsequent service charge with regard to such parcel and all interest accrued
thereon shall be fully paid to the sewerage authority.  If for any reason such
supply of water shall not be promptly stopped or restricted as required by
section twenty-six of this act, the sewerage authority may itself shut off or
restrict such supply and, for that purpose, may enter on any lands, waters or
premises of any county, municipality or other person.  The supply of water to
such parcel shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, be
restored or increased if the State Department of Health, upon application of
the local board of health or health officer of the municipality where such
parcel is situate, shall after public hearing find and shall certify to the
sewerage authority that the continuance of such stopping or restriction of the
supply of water endangers the health of the public in such municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   The collector or other
officer of every municipality charged by law with the duty of enforcing
municipal liens on real property shall enforce, with and as any other municipal
lien on real property in such municipality, all service charges and the lien
thereof shown in any statement filed with him by any sewerage authority
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and shall pay over to the sewerage
authority the sums or a pro rata share of the sums realized upon such
enforcement or upon liquidation of any property acquired by the municipality by
virtue of such enforcement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   In the event that any
service charge of a sewerage authority shall not be paid as and when due, the
unpaid balance thereof and all interest accrued thereon, together with
attorney's fees and costs, may be recovered by the sewerage authority in a
civil action, and any lien on real property for such service charge and
interest accrued thereon may be foreclosed or otherwise enforced by the sewerage
authority by action or suit in equity as for the foreclosure of a mortgage on
such real property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   All rights and remedies
granted by this act for the collection and enforcement of service charges shall
be cumulative and concurrent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)   Notwithstanding the
provisions of this section, if the Governor has declared a public health
emergency pursuant to the &quot;Emergency Health Powers Act,&quot; P.L.2005,
c.222 (C.26:13-1 et seq.), or a state of emergency, pursuant to P.L.1942, c.251
(C.App.A:9-33 et seq.), or both, in response to a flood, hurricane, superstorm,
tornado, natural or other disaster, or public health emergency, then, for the
duration of the public health emergency, state of emergency, or both and for a
period up to 90 days after the public health emergency, state of emergency, or
both, are no longer in effect, the sewerage authority may, in its discretion,
engage in any combination of the following: (1) not charge interest on the
delinquent payment; (2) not place a lien on such parcel of real property for
the unpaid balance for any service charge and all interest accruing thereon; or
(3) not discontinue service of any property for the failure to pay any amount
owing.  A sewerage authority shall exercise the discretionary authority it is
provided under this subsection consistently to all properties, or to all
properties of the same use type or other appropriate category.</p>

c.183 (C.40:14B-22) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     22.  Every municipal authority
is hereby authorized to charge and collect rents, rates, fees or other charges
(in this act sometimes referred to as &quot;sewerage service charges&quot;) for
direct or indirect connection with, or the use or services of, the sewerage
system.  Such sewerage service charges may be charged to and collected from any
person contracting for such connection or use or services or from the owner or
occupant, or both of them, of any real property which directly or indirectly is
or has been connected with the sewerage system or from or on which originates
or has originated sewage or other wastes which directly or indirectly have
entered or may enter the sewerage system, and the owner of any such real
property shall be liable for and shall pay such sewerage service charges to the
municipal authority at the time when and place where such sewerage service
charges are due and payable. <u>Every municipal authority may charge interest
on unpaid rents, rates, fees, or other charges imposed for direct or indirect connection
with, or the use or services of, the sewerage system pursuant to this
subsection; however, a municipal authority shall not impose interest on unpaid
rents, rates, fees, or other charges attributable to the State or a local unit,
or any of their agencies and authorities, including, but not limited to, a
housing authority.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Such rents, rates, fees and
charges, being in the nature of use or service charges, shall as nearly as the
municipal authority shall deem practicable and equitable be uniform throughout
the district for the same type, class and amount of use or service of the
sewerage system, except as permitted by section 1 of
P.L.1992,&nbsp;c.215&nbsp;(C.40:14B-22.2),&nbsp;and may be based or computed
either on the consumption of water on or in connection with the real property,
making due allowance for commercial use of water, or on the number and kind of
water outlets on or in connection with the real property, or on the number and
kind of plumbing or sewerage fixtures or facilities on or in connection with the
real property, or on the number of persons residing or working on or otherwise
connected or identified with the real property, or on the capacity of the
improvements on or connected with the real property, or on any other factors
determining the type, class and amount of use or service of the sewerage
system, or on any combination of any such factors, and may give weight to the
characteristics of the sewage and other wastes and any other special matter
affecting the cost of treatment and disposal of the same, including chlorine
demand, biochemical oxygen demand, concentration of solids and chemical
composition, and, as to service outside the district, the cost of installation
of necessary physical properties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to any such
sewerage service charges, a separate charge in the nature of a connection fee
or tapping fee, in respect of each connection of any property with
the sewerage system, may be imposed upon the owner or occupant of the property
so connected.  Such connection charges shall be uniform within each class of
users, except as provided by section 5 of
P.L.2005,&nbsp;c.29&nbsp;(C.40:14B-22.3)&nbsp;and except as provided by section
5 of P.L.2005,&nbsp;c.173&nbsp;(C.44:14B-22.4),&nbsp;and the amount thereof
shall not exceed the actual cost of the physical connection, if made by the
authority, plus an amount computed in the following manner to represent a fair
payment towards the cost of the system:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The amount representing
all debt service, including but not limited to sinking funds, reserve funds,
the principal and interest on bonds, and the amount of any loans and the
interest thereon, paid by the municipal authority to defray the capital cost of
developing the system as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year of
the authority shall be added to all capital expenditures made by a municipal
authority not funded by a bond ordinance or debt for the development of the
system as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year of the authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Any gifts, contributions
or subsidies to the authority received from, and not reimbursed or reimbursable
to, any federal, State, county or municipal government or agency or any private
person, and that portion of amounts paid to the authority by a public entity
under a service agreement or service contract which is not repaid to the public
entity by the authority, shall then be subtracted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The remainder shall be
divided by the total number of service units served by the authority at the end
of the immediately preceding fiscal year of the authority, and the results
shall then be apportioned to each new connector according to the number of
service units attributed to that connector.  In attributing service units to
each connector, the estimated average daily flow of sewage for the connector
shall be divided by the average daily flow of sewage from the average single
family residence in the authority's district, to produce the number of service
units to be attributed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The connection fee shall be
recomputed at the end of each fiscal year of the authority, after a public
hearing is held in the manner prescribed in section 23 of P.L.1957, c.183
(C.40:14B-23). The revised connection fee may be imposed upon those who
subsequently connect in that fiscal year to the system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The combination of such
connection fee or tapping fee and the aforesaid sewerage service charges shall
meet the requirements of section 23.</p>

c.384 (C.40:14B-22.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     15.  Every municipal authority
is hereby authorized to charge and collect rents, rates, fees or other charges
(in this act sometimes referred to as &quot;solid waste service charges&quot;)
for the use or services of the solid waste system.  Such solid waste service
charges may be charged to and collected from any municipality or any person
contracting for such use or services or from the owner or occupant, or both of
them, of any real property from or on which originates or has originated any
solid waste to be treated by the solid waste system of the authority, and the owner
of any such real property shall be liable for and shall pay such solid waste
service charges to the municipal authority at the time when and place where
such solid waste service charges are due and payable.  <u>Every municipal
authority may charge interest on unpaid rents, rates, fees, or other charges
imposed for direct or indirect connection with, or the use or services of, the
solid waste system pursuant to this subsection; however, a municipal authority
shall not impose interest on unpaid rents, rates, fees, or other charges
attributable to the State or a local unit, or any of their agencies and
authorities, including, but not limited to, a housing authority.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Such rents, rates, fees and
charges, being in the nature of use or service charges, shall as nearly as the
authority shall deem practicable and equitable be uniform throughout the county
for the same type, class and amount of use or service of the solid waste
system, except as permitted by section 1 of
P.L.1992,&nbsp;c.215&nbsp;(C.40:14B-22.2),&nbsp;and may be based or computed on
any factors determining the type, class and amount of use or service of the
solid waste system, and may give weight to the characteristics of the solid
waste and any other special matter affecting the cost of treatment and disposal
of the same.</p>

c.53 (C.40A:26A-10) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    After the commencement
of operation of sewerage facilities, the local unit or units may prescribe and,
from time to time, alter rates or rentals to be charged to users of sewerage
services.  <u>Every local unit or units may charge interest on unpaid rates or
rentals imposed for direct or indirect connection with, or the use or services
of, sewerage facilities pursuant to this section; however, a local unit shall
not impose interest on unpaid rates or rentals attributable to the State or a
local unit, or any of their agencies and authorities, including, but not

nature of use or service charges or annual rental charges, shall be uniform and
equitable for the same types and classes of use and service of the facilities,
except as permitted by section 5 of P.L.1994, c.78 (C.40A:26A-10.1).  Rates or
rentals and types and classes of use and service may be based on any factors
which the governing body or bodies of that local unit or units shall deem
proper and equitable within the region served.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In fixing rates, rental and
other charges for supplying sewerage services, the local unit or units shall
establish a rate structure that allows, within the limits of any lawful
covenants made with bondholders, the local unit to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Recover all costs of
acquisition, construction or operation, including the costs of raw materials,
administration, real or personal property, maintenance, taxes, debt service
charges, fees and an amount equal to any operating budget deficit occurring in
the immediately preceding fiscal year;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Establish a surplus in
an amount sufficient to provide for the reasonable anticipation of any
contingency that may affect the operating of the sewerage facility, and, at the
discretion of the local unit or units, allow for the transfer of moneys from
the budget for the sewerage facilities to the local budget in accordance with
section 5 of P.L.1983, c.111 (C.40A:4-35.1).</p>
