SR17 SENATE RESOLUTION No. 17 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  JOSEPH PENNACCHIO District 26 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Urges US Congress to pass Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Senate Resolution urging the United States Congress to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Whereas, In response to troubling indications that some abortion providers do not regard infants born alive during abortion procedures as legal persons, in 2002 the United States Congress passed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act (BAIPA), which provides legal protection to an infant who is born alive at any stage of development, regardless of whether the infants delivery was the result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion; and Whereas, Despite extending legal protections to infants who survive abortion attempts, BAIPA does not impose any penalties on physicians who neglect to provide medical care for these infants; and Whereas, In the years since BAIPA was enacted, evidence has come to light that some abortion providers still do not regard infants born alive during abortion procedures as legal persons, and do not provide them the same degree of medical care that they would provide to premature infants who are born spontaneously; and Whereas, As of 2014, only 26 U.S. states had laws mandating care for infants born alive after an attempted abortion, and some U.S. states have recently proposed or enacted bills that would remove existing protections; and Whereas, The recently-introduced federal Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act addresses this problem by imposing criminal penalties on an individual who fails to provide medical care to an infant born alive during an abortion procedure, or who intentionally kills or attempts to kill an infant who survives an attempted abortion; and Whereas, In light of the ongoing threat to the safety and well-being of infants born alive during abortion procedures, it is in the best interests of citizens born in the State of New Jersey and the nation for Congress to pass the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House hereby urges the United States Congress to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and to require all states to comply with the provisions of the law. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and every member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution urges the United States Congress to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and to require all states to comply with the provisions of the law. In response to troubling indications that some abortion providers do not regard infants born alive during abortion procedures as legal persons, in 2002 the United States Congress enacted the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act (BAIPA), which provides legal protection to an infant who is born alive at any stage of development, regardless of whether the infants delivery was the result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.  Despite extending legal protections to infants who survive abortion attempts, BAIPA does not impose any penalties on physicians who neglect to provide medical care for these infants. In the years since BAIPA was enacted, evidence has come to light that some abortion providers still do not regard infants born alive during abortion procedures as legal persons, and do not provide them the same degree of medical care that they would provide to premature infants who are born spontaneously.  As of 2014, only 26 U.S. states had some kind of statute mandating care for infants born alive after an attempted abortion, and some U.S. states have recently proposed or enacted bills that would remove existing protections.  The recently-introduced federal Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act addresses this problem by imposing criminal penalties on an individual who fails to provide medical care to an infant born alive during an abortion procedure, or who intentionally kills or attempts to kill an infant who survives an attempted abortion.
