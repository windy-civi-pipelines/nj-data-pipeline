AR89 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 89 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  DONALD A. GUARDIAN District 2 (Atlantic) SYNOPSIS Urges Congress and Department of Veterans Affairs not to reduce funding for ambulance services for veterans. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Assembly resolution respectfully urging Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs not to reduce funding for ambulance services for veterans. Whereas, The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has provided veterans with reimbursements for ambulance services during medical emergencies since 1984; and Whereas, There are 338,012 veterans in New Jersey, many of whom rely on free ambulance transportation to receive the health care they need; and Whereas, The Department of Veterans Affairs is considering substantial reductions to reimbursement rates for ambulance services, posing a potential risk to veterans access to vital medical transportation; and Whereas, Without funding from the federal government to provide ambulance services to veterans, this financial responsibility may fall onto state and local governments; and Whereas, The shift of financial responsibility for ambulance services from the federal government to state and local entities could negatively impact the ability to access ambulance services for veterans and other residents; and Whereas, State and local governments lack the necessary resources and time to develop alternative programs to provide ambulance services to veterans; and Whereas, Rural areas, which are home to a significant number of veterans, have experienced a surge in hospital closures over the past 30 years, making access to medical facilities more expensive and more challenging; and Whereas, The average ambulance bill in New Jersey costs patients between $400 and $600; and Whereas, Cost-cutting measures that result in reduced reimbursements for ambulance services could create financial barriers for veterans, leading them to forgo necessary medical care due to the high costs associated with emergency transportation; and Whereas, The proposed cuts may compel ambulance companies to reduce their services, resulting in service withdrawal in rural areas where ambulance services are no longer profitable; and Whereas, These represent a departure from the longstanding military principle of leaving no one behind, as this will leave thousands of veterans without access to health care; now therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. This House urges the United States Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs not to reduce funding for ambulance services for veterans. 2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the President of the United States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States House of Representatives, and each member of the United States Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This Assembly resolution urges the United States Congress and the federal Department of Veterans Affairs to refrain from implementing proposed reductions in reimbursements for ambulance services for veterans. Shifting this financial burden from the federal government to state and local entities would have detrimental effects on the ability for veterans to access free ambulance transportation. Given that there are 338,012 veterans living in the State of New Jersey, it is imperative to maintain these federal reimbursements. The average ambulance bill in New Jersey, ranging from $400 to $600, would place a significant financial burden on veterans if reimbursements are reduced. This burden is especially concerning in rural areas, which are already grappling with a surge in hospital closures and higher ambulance transportation costs. In light of these challenges, it is crucial for Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs to uphold their commitment to veterans by continuing to provide necessary reimbursements for ambulance transportation.
