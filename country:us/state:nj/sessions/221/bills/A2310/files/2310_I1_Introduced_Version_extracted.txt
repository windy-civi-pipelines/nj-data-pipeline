Although current law requires several types of health insurance carriers to provide coverage for medically necessary health care services that are provided in association with the treatment of a physical injury resulting from domestic violence, no insurance carrier is similarly required to provide coverage for mental health care that is received by victims of domestic violence.  This bill would fill this gap in the law by recognizing the medical necessity of all mental health treatment and therapy received by a victim of domestic violence and requiring all carriers to provide full benefits coverage therefor.
