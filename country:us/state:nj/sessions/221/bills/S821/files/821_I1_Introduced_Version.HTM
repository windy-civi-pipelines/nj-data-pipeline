<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 7 of P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-307) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.    It shall be the duty of
the council, seven months after the confirmation of the last member initially
appointed to the council, or January 1, 1986, whichever is earlier, and from
time to time thereafter, to: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Determine housing
regions of the State; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Estimate the present and
prospective need for low and moderate income housing at the State and regional
levels; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Adopt criteria and
guidelines for: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Municipal determination
of its present and prospective fair share of the housing need in a given region
which shall be computed for a 10-year period. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Municipal fair share shall be
determined after crediting on a one-to-one basis each current unit of low and
moderate income housing of adequate standard, including any such housing
constructed or acquired as part of a housing program specifically intended to
provide housing for low and moderate income households. Notwithstanding any
other law to the contrary, a municipality shall be entitled to a credit for a
unit if it demonstrates that (a) the municipality issued a certificate of
occupancy for the unit, which was either newly constructed or rehabilitated
between April 1, 1980 and December 15, 1986; (b) a construction code official
certifies, based upon a visual exterior survey, that the unit is in compliance
with pertinent construction code standards with respect to structural elements,
roofing, siding, doors and windows; (c) the household occupying the unit
certifies in writing, under penalty of perjury, that it receives no greater
income than that established pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222
(C.52:27D-304) to qualify for moderate income housing; and (d) the unit for
which credit is sought is affordable to low and moderate income households under
the standards established by the council at the time of filing of the petition
for substantive certification.  It shall be sufficient if the certification
required in subparagraph (c) is signed by one member of the household.  A
certification submitted pursuant to this paragraph shall be reviewable only by
the council or its staff and shall not be a public record; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing in P.L.1995, c.81
shall affect the validity of substantive certification granted by the council
prior to November 21, 1994, or of a judgment of compliance entered by any court
of competent jurisdiction prior to that date.  Additionally, any municipality
that received substantive certification or a judgment of compliance prior to
November 21, 1994 and filed a motion prior to November 21, 1994 to amend
substantive certification or a judgment of compliance for the purpose of
obtaining credits, shall be entitled to a determination of its right to credits
pursuant to the standards established by the Legislature prior to P.L.1995,
c.81.  Any municipality that filed a motion prior to November 21, 1994 for the
purpose of obtaining credits, which motion was supported by the results of a
completed survey performed pursuant to council rules, shall be entitled to a
determination of its right to credits pursuant to the standards established by
the Legislature prior to P.L.1995, c.81; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Municipal adjustment of
the present and prospective fair share based upon available vacant and
developable land, infrastructure considerations or environmental or historic
preservation factors and adjustments shall be made whenever: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The preservation of
historically or important architecture and sites and their environs or
environmentally sensitive lands may be jeopardized, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The established pattern
of development in the community would be drastically altered, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Adequate land for
recreational, conservation or agricultural and farmland preservation purposes
would not be provided, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Adequate open space
would not be provided, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   The pattern of
development is contrary to the planning designations in the State Development
and Redevelopment Plan prepared pursuant to sections 1 through 12 of P.L.1985,
c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.), </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   Vacant and developable
land is not available in the municipality, and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   Adequate public
facilities and infrastructure capacities are not available, or would result in
costs prohibitive to the public if provided. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.1993, c.31). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Provide population and
household projections for the State and housing regions; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In its discretion,
place a limit, based on a percentage of existing housing stock in a
municipality and any other criteria including employment opportunities which
the council deems appropriate, upon the aggregate number of units which may be
allocated to a municipality as its fair share of the region's present and
prospective need for low and moderate income housing.  No municipality shall be
required to address a fair share of housing units affordable to households with
a gross household income of less than 80% of the median gross household income
beyond 1,000 units within ten years from the grant of substantive
certification, unless it is demonstrated, following objection by an interested
party and an evidentiary hearing, based upon the facts and circumstances of the
affected municipality that it is likely that the municipality through its
zoning powers could create a realistic opportunity for more than 1,000 low and
moderate income units within that ten-year period.  For the purposes of this
section, the facts and circumstances which shall determine whether a
municipality's fair share shall exceed 1,000 units, as provided above, shall be

that particular project.  This preference shall be established in the applicant
selection process for available affordable units so that applicants who are
veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as referenced in this
subsection, and who apply within 90 days of the initial marketing period shall
receive preference for the rental of the agreed-upon percentage of affordable
units.  After the first 90 days of the initial 120-day marketing period, if any
of those units subject to the preference remain available, then applicants from
the general public shall be considered for occupancy.  Following the initial
120-day marketing period, previously qualified applicants and future qualified
applicants who are veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as
referenced in this subsection, shall be placed on a special waiting list as
well as the general waiting list.  The veterans on the special waiting list
shall be given preference for affordable units, as the units become available,
whenever the percentage of preference-occupied units falls below the agreed
upon percentage.  Any agreement to provide affordable housing preferences for
veterans pursuant to this subsection shall not affect a municipality's ability
to receive credit for the unit from the council, or its successor.</p>
