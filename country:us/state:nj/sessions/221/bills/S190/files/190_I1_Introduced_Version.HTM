a controlled dangerous substance or the specific controlled dangerous
substance, and to any substance that is an immediate precursor of a controlled

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires offenses
involving manufacturing, distributing, and dispensing heroin to be graded based
on the number of dosage units of heroin, in addition to the weight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
distribution of heroin and cocaine are punishable as if they were the same
substance. However, heroin provides more pharmacological effect from a given
weight than does cocaine. A dosage unit of heroin typically weighs
approximately 0.02 grams.  It is not uncommon for a dosage unit of cocaine to
weigh approximately 14 grams, or 0.49 ounces.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law,
manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to distribute a dosage unit
of cocaine in the amount of up to 0.5 ounces would be punishable as crimes of
the third degree.  Accordingly, a single dosage unit of cocaine that weighs
0.49 ounces would be would be punishable as a crime of the third degree.  A
person who manufactures, distributes, or possesses approximately 700 dosage
units of heroin would also only be guilty of a crime of the third degree. 
Thus, in effect, the current statutes allow those who distribute heroin to be
treated far more leniently than those who distribute cocaine.  The new
classification scheme established under the bill for the crime of distribution
of heroin would be as follows: </p>
