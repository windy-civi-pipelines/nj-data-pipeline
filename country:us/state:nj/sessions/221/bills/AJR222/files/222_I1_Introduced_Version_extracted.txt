AJR222 ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION No. 222 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 8, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ELLEN J. PARK District 37 (Bergen) SYNOPSIS Designates May 1 of each year as Rule of Law Day in NJ. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution designating May 1 of each year as Rule of Law Day in New Jersey. Whereas, The rule of law protects against the abuse of power and promotes stability through creating democratic norms where all are equally subject to the law, including the highest-ranking officials, and application of the law is clear, predictable, and consistent; and Whereas, In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower first proclaimed May 1 as Law Day in the United States; and Whereas, Since 1958, every president of both political parties has reaffirmed May 1 as Law Day and has urged Americans to rededicate themselves to the rule of law as crafted by the Constitution to ensure liberty, justice, and equality; and Whereas, Americans are witnessing the erosion of constitutional rules and democratic norms in the United States as the current presidential administration ignores the courts, bypasses Congress, and governs by decree and executive order; and Whereas, Any action to eliminate checks and balances on executive power, suppress dissent, dismantle the civil service, target marginalized communities, and intensify political divisions in government and among residents violates the constitutional order and democratic norms; and Whereas, The arbitrary dismissal of civil servants will directly impact important government programs that many New Jersey residents and Americans rely upon, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; and Whereas, The Judicial Branch is independent and free from political interference and Americas legal community advocates for equal justice under the law for everyone, regardless of sex, race, religion, or political viewpoint; and Whereas, Recently, the President of the United States issued executive orders to review and terminate contracts with certain law firms and to suspend the security clearances of individuals at those firms, citing the firms political and diversity practices; and Whereas, Those executive orders may violate constitutional protections and represent extreme acts of retribution against lawyers that may discourage access to First Amendment rights; and Whereas, New Jerseyans support the right of people to advance their interests in courts of law when they have been wronged, and New Jerseyans reject the notion that the U.S. government can seek to twist the scales of justice by punishing lawyers, law firms, or judges for who they represent or how they rule; and Whereas, Efforts to intimidate and undermine the courts and the legal profession are unacceptable and must end. New Jerseyans will not stay silent while there are efforts to remake the legal profession into something that rewards those who agree with the government and punishes those who do not. Intimidating words and actions designed to cow judges, courts, and the legal profession in this country must end; and Whereas, Americans have always believed in the principle that no one is above the law, not even the President of the United States, and that checks and balances on executive power must remain a viable and continuing principle of constitutional governance; and Whereas, Americans must protect the ability of the public and the communications media to voice dissenting views without fear of retribution; and Whereas, New Jersey observes Law Day on May 1 of each year to recognize the ideals of liberty, equality, and justice under the law and to cultivate the respect for law that is vital to the democratic way of life; and Whereas, Recognizing that the rule of law that supports our democracy and protects against tyranny is being tested, the State encourages the people of New Jersey to reflect upon the impact that the rule of law has had on the quality of their lives and its importance to a functioning democracy; and Whereas, It is fitting and proper to designate May 1 of each year as Rule of Law Day in New Jersey and to encourage the residents of this State to join in the observance of this day; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. May 1 of each year is designated as Rule of Law Day in New Jersey. 2. The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation calling upon public officials, residents of the State, and other interested groups to reflect upon their role in protecting the rule of law and rejecting violations of constitutional law and democratic norms as they observe Rule of Law Day with appropriate activities and programs. 3. This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates May 1 of each year as Rule of Law Day in New Jersey.  The rule of law protects against the abuse of power and promotes stability through creating democratic norms where all are equally subject to the law, including the highest-ranking officials, and application of the law is clear, predictable, and consistent. Americans are witnessing the erosion of constitutional rules and democratic norms in the United States as the current presidential administration ignores the courts, bypasses Congress, and rules by executive order.  Any action to eliminate checks and balances on executive power, suppress dissent, dismantle the civil service, target marginalized communities, and intensify political divisions in government and among residents violates the constitutional order and democratic norms.  The arbitrary dismissal of civil servants will directly impact important government programs that many New Jersey residents and Americans rely upon.  The public and communications media must retain the ability to voice dissenting views without fear of retribution. Executive orders targeting certain law firms and individuals who work at those firms represent extreme acts of retribution.  People have the right to advance their interests in the courts of law when they have been wronged, and New Jerseyans reject the notion that the U.S. government can seek to twist the scales of justice by punishing lawyers, law firms, or judges for who they represent or how they rule.  Efforts to intimidate and undermine the courts and the legal profession are unacceptable and must end.  New Jerseyans will not stay silent while there are efforts to remake the legal profession into something that rewards those who agree with the government and punishes those who do not. Americans have always believed in the principle that no one is above the law, not even the President of the United States, and that checks and balances on executive power must remain.  Recognizing that the rule of law that supports our democracy and protects against tyranny is being tested, the State encourages the people of New Jersey to reflect upon the impact that the rule of law has had on the quality of their lives and its importance to a functioning democracy. The resolution respectfully asks the Governor to annually issue a proclamation calling upon public officials, residents of the State, and other interested groups to reflect upon their role in protecting the rule of law and rejecting violations of constitutional laws and democratic norms as they observe the day with appropriate activities and programs.
