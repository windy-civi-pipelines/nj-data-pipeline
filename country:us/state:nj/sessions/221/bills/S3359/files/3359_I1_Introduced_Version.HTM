<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, designated as CJs
Law, would criminalize the manufacture, possession and sale of products
containing kratom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Kratom, as known as mitragyna
speciosa korth, mitragynine extract, biak-biak, cratom, gratom, ithang, kakuam,
katawn, kedemba, ketum, krathom, krton, mambog, madat, Maeng da leaf, nauclea,
or Nauclea Speciosa, is a botanical substance that grows naturally in Southeast
Asia.  The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that kratom poses
a threat to public health and has the potential for abuse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Kratom is frequently marketed
on the Internet for its psychoactive and opioid-like analgesic effects, and for
use in the treatment of morphine and heroin addiction.  However, kratom is not
approved in the United States for any medical use.  In a statement released in
April 2022, the FDA warned the public against using kratom, warning that the
substance affects the same opioid brain receptors as morphine and that it
appears to have properties that expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse,
and dependence.  According to the FDA, scientific literature has disclosed
serious concerns regarding the toxicity of kratom in multiple organ systems,
with consumption leading to a number of health issues, including depressed respiratory
function, nervousness, agitation, aggression, sleeplessness, hallucinations,
delusions, loss of libido, tremors, skin hyperpigmentation, nausea, vomiting,
constipation, and severe withdrawal signs and symptoms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, possession and
distribution of kratom is not barred by federal or New Jersey law.  However,
the FDA Import Alert # 54-15 provides guidance for FDA field personnel
regarding the detention of dietary supplements and bulk dietary ingredients
that contain kratom.  The FDA has also issued a number of warning letters and
conducted seizures of illegally sold, unapproved, or misbranded drug products containing
kratom that make unproven claims about their ability to treat or cure opioid
addiction and withdrawal symptoms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Kratom is banned or its uses
restricted in several countries, including Australia, Denmark, Finland, France
, Germany, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand,
Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. Kratom
is also illegal in several states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Rhode
Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.  Several states have passed laws restricting
its sale and use, while several other states have introduced legislation that
would ban this drug.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends existing law
to include kratom as a controlled dangerous substance and to sets out
gradations for crimes involving the substance.  The bill would make it a crime
of the second degree to manufacture, distribute or dispense, or possess or have
under ones control with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a
substance containing kratom in an amount of one ounce or more, including
adulterants and dilutants.  A crime of the second degree is punishable by a
term of imprisonment of five to 10 years, a fine of up to $150,000, or both. 
It would be a crime of the third degree to manufacture, distribute or dispense,
or possess or have under ones control with intent to manufacture, distribute,
or dispense a substance containing kratom in an amount of less than one ounce,
including adulterants and dilutants.  A crime of the third degree is punishable
by a term of imprisonment of three to five years, a fine of up to $15,000, or
both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the possession
of one ounce or more, including adulterants and dilutants, of a substance
containing kratom would be a crime of the third degree, and possession of less
than one ounce, including adulterants and dilutants, would be a crime of the
fourth degree.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by a term of
imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     CJs Law is designated in
remembrance of Christopher James (CJ) Holowach, who died at age 33 from cardiac
arrest caused by mixture of drugs that included his physician prescribed
Adderol and kratom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     While awaiting arm surgery, CJ
Holowach consumed kratom to numb his arm pain without jeopardizing his recovery
from opioid addiction.  However, he was unaware of the dangers of kratom as the
supplements bottle provided no warning labels or suggestions on safe dosage
amounts.  Kratom is marketed in a way to make it appear to be a safe herbal
pain supplement, when it poses serious health risks.  Further, addiction
experts warn, echoing the sentiments of FDA warnings, that kratom can be highly
addictive and create risk of abuse and dependence. &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors hope that
this bill will stop the sale of kratom in New Jersey, avoiding further
tragedies including death.</p>
