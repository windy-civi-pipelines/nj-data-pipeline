The chief police officer or the superintendent shall obtain the fingerprints of the applicant and shall have them compared with any and all records of fingerprints in the municipality and county in which the applicant resides and also the records of the State Bureau of Identification and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, provided that an applicant for a handgun purchase permit who possesses a valid firearms purchaser identification card, or who has previously obtained a handgun purchase permit from the same licensing authority for which he was previously fingerprinted, and who provides other reasonably satisfactory proof of his identity, need not be fingerprinted again; however, the chief police officer or the superintendent shall proceed to investigate the application to determine whether or not the applicant has become subject to any of the disabilities set forth in this chapter. f.     Granting of permit or identification card; fee; term; renewal; revocation.  The application for the permit to purchase a handgun together with a fee of $2, or the application for the firearms purchaser identification card together with a fee of $5, shall be delivered or forwarded to the licensing authority who shall investigate the same and, unless good cause for the denial thereof appears, shall grant the permit or the identification card, or both, if application has been made therefor, within 30 days from the date of receipt of the application for residents of this State and within 45 days for nonresident applicants.  A permit to purchase a handgun shall be valid for a period of 90 days from the date of issuance and may be renewed by the issuing authority for good cause for an additional 90 days.  A firearms purchaser identification card shall be valid until such time as the holder becomes subject to any of the disabilities set forth in subsection c. of this section, whereupon the card shall be void and shall be returned within five days by the holder to the superintendent, who shall then advise the licensing authority.  Failure of the holder to return the firearms purchaser identification card to the superintendent within the five days shall be an offense under subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:39-10.  Any firearms purchaser identification card may be revoked by the Superior Court of the county wherein the card was issued, after hearing upon notice, upon a finding that the holder thereof no longer qualifies for the issuance of the permit.

Only one handgun shall be purchased or delivered on each permit and no more than one handgun shall be purchased within any 30-day period, but this limitation shall not apply to: (1)   a federal, State, or local law enforcement officer or agency purchasing handguns for use by officers in the actual performance of their law enforcement duties; (2)   a collector of handguns as curios or relics as defined in Title 18, United States Code, section 921 (a) (13) who has in his possession a valid Collector of Curios and Relics License issued by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; (3)   transfers of handguns among licensed retail dealers, registered wholesale dealers and registered manufacturers; (4)   transfers of handguns from any person to a licensed retail dealer or a registered wholesale dealer or registered manufacturer; (5)   any transaction where the person has purchased a handgun from a licensed retail dealer and has returned that handgun to the dealer in exchange for another handgun within 30 days of the original transaction, provided the retail dealer reports the exchange transaction to the superintendent; or (6)   any transaction where the superintendent issues an exemption from the prohibition in this subsection pursuant to the provisions of section 4 of P.L.2009, c.186 (C.2C:58-3.4). The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to afford or authorize any other exemption from the regulatory provisions governing firearms set forth in chapter 39 and chapter 58 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes; A person shall not be restricted as to the number of rifles or shotguns he may purchase, provided he possesses a valid firearms purchaser identification card and provided further that he signs the certification required in subsection b. of this section for each transaction. j.     Firearms passing to heirs or legatees.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section concerning the transfer, receipt or acquisition of a firearm, a permit to purchase or a firearms purchaser identification card shall not be required for the passing of a firearm upon the death of an owner thereof to his heir or legatee, whether the same be by testamentary bequest or by the laws of intestacy.  The person who shall so receive, or acquire the firearm shall, however, be subject to all other provisions of this chapter. If the heir or legatee of the firearm does not qualify to possess or carry it, he may retain ownership of the firearm for the purpose of sale for a period not exceeding 180 days, or for a further limited period as may be approved by the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality in which the heir or legatee resides or the superintendent, provided that the firearm is in the custody of the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality or the superintendent during that period. k.    Sawed-off shotguns. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the purchase or possession of any sawed-off shotgun. l.     Nothing in this section and in N.J.S.2C:58-2 shall apply to the sale or purchase of a visual distress signalling device approved by the United States Coast Guard, solely for possession on a private or commercial aircraft or any boat; provided, however, that no person under the age of 18 years shall purchase nor shall any person sell to a person under the age of 18 years a visual distress signalling device. m.   The provisions of subsections a. and b. of this section and paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:58-2 shall not apply to the purchase of firearms by a law enforcement agency for use by law enforcement officers in the actual performance of the officers' official duties, which purchase may be made directly from a manufacturer or from a licensed dealer located in this State or any other state. n.    For the purposes of this section, "immediate family" means a spouse, domestic partner as defined in section 3 of P.L.2003, c.246 (C.26:8A-3), partner in a civil union couple as defined in section 2 of P.L.2006, c.103 (C.37:1-29), parent, stepparent, grandparent, sibling, stepsibling, child, stepchild, and grandchild, as related by blood or by law. (cf: P.L.2018, c.36, s.1) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides for certain law enforcement officials to be notified when a person applies to the court to have a mental health record expunged for the purposes of purchasing a firearm. Current law requires licensed firearms retailers to conduct a background check of prospective firearms purchasers using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). A NICS check determines if the person is eligible to purchase a firearm under federal and State law.  Pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2013, c.115 (C.30:4-24.3a), the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), in cooperation with the Attorney General and the State Police, has transmitted approximately 558,000 records of mental health adjudications dating back to the 1970s to NICS.  Prospective purchasers who were formerly committed to a mental institution, but who have since recovered and now seek to legally purchase a firearm, may be found ineligible due to a mental health record in NICS. To have a mental health record removed from NICS, a person is required to file an expungement application in the state that transmitted the record to NICS.  In this State, expungement of a mental health adjudication is governed by P.L.1953, c.268 (C:30:4-80.8 et seq.).  A person with a mental health record who has been discharged from a psychiatric facility as recovered, substantially improved, or in substantial remission, may apply to the court to have that record expunged. When considering an application to have the record expunged, the court is required to hear evidence concerning the circumstances of the petitioners commitment or determination, the petitioners mental health record and criminal history, and the petitioners reputation in the community. If the court finds that the petitioner will not likely act in a manner dangerous to the public safety and that the grant of relief is not contrary to the public interest, the court is required to grant relief and expunge the record.  The AOC and the State Police amend the record in NICS to reflect the expungement.  Once the record is expunged, the commitment is deemed not to have occurred.  Under the bill as amended, the expungement of the record is not to be used as the sole basis for denial of a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun. Law enforcement officials currently are not involved in the determination of whether a mental health record of a prospective firearms purchaser should be expunged.  Since law enforcement officials may be aware of information which is not readily accessible to the court, such as pending charges, the purchasers criminal history, or any aberrant behavior within the community, this bill authorizes law enforcement participation in this determination.  Specifically, the bill requires an applicant for expungement to serve notice on law enforcement officials in the applicants current state of residence if the purpose of the expungement is to remove the mental health adjudication record from NICS to allow for the purchase of a firearm.  Upon being served, these law enforcement officials would have the option to provide information to the court concerning the applicants criminal history or behavior for consideration during the expungement proceedings.

STATEMENT This bill provides for certain law enforcement officials to be notified when a person applies to the court to have a mental health record expunged for the purposes of purchasing a firearm. Current law requires licensed firearms retailers to conduct a background check of prospective firearms purchasers using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). A NICS check determines if the person is eligible to purchase a firearm under federal and State law.  Pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2013, c.115 (C.30:4-24.3a), the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), in cooperation with the Attorney General and the State Police, has transmitted approximately 558,000 records of mental health adjudications dating back to the 1970s to NICS.  Prospective purchasers who were formerly committed to a mental institution, but who have since recovered and now seek to legally purchase a firearm, may be found ineligible due to a mental health record in NICS. To have a mental health record removed from NICS, a person is required to file an expungement application in the state that transmitted the record to NICS.  In this State, expungement of a mental health adjudication is governed by P.L.1953, c.268 (C:30:4-80.8 et seq.).  A person with a mental health record who has been discharged from a psychiatric facility as recovered, substantially improved, or in substantial remission, may apply to the court to have that record expunged. When considering an application to have the record expunged, the court is required to hear evidence concerning the circumstances of the petitioners commitment or determination, the petitioners mental health record and criminal history, and the petitioners reputation in the community. If the court finds that the petitioner will not likely act in a manner dangerous to the public safety and that the grant of relief is not contrary to the public interest, the court is required to grant relief and expunge the record.  The AOC and the State Police amend the record in NICS to reflect the expungement.  Once the record is expunged, the commitment is deemed not to have occurred.  Under the bill as amended, the expungement of the record is not to be used as the sole basis for denial of a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun. Law enforcement officials currently are not involved in the determination of whether a mental health record of a prospective firearms purchaser should be expunged.  Since law enforcement officials may be aware of information which is not readily accessible to the court, such as pending charges, the purchasers criminal history, or any aberrant behavior within the community, this bill authorizes law enforcement participation in this determination.  Specifically, the bill requires an applicant for expungement to serve notice on law enforcement officials in the applicants current state of residence if the purpose of the expungement is to remove the mental health adjudication record from NICS to allow for the purchase of a firearm.  Upon being served, these law enforcement officials would have the option to provide information to the court concerning the applicants criminal history or behavior for consideration during the expungement proceedings.
