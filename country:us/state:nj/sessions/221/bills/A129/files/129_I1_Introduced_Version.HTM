<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  As used
in sections 1 through 5 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     Animal
means any vertebrate other than humans, except that, other than animals used in
connection with a violation of R.S.4:22-24 and equine animals, animal shall
not include domestic livestock as defined by section 1 of P.L.1995, c.311
(C.4:22-16.1).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Animal care facility&quot;
means a shelter, pound, kennel, animal rescue organization facility, or foster
home, as those terms are defined in section 1 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.1),
a facility owned or operated by a humane society or other organization, or a representative
thereof,  that has temporary custody of an animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Animal cruelty
violation&quot; means and includes any civil or criminal violation of chapter
19 or 22 of Title 4 of the Revised Statutes, Title 2C of the New Jersey
Statutes, or any other State law concerning animal cruelty, except a civil or
criminal violation of P.L.2019, c.83 (C.4:22-17.1 et seq.), pertaining to the
care or tethering of dogs, domestic companion animals, and service animals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Enforcement agency&quot;
means any agency, department, organization, or county society for the
prevention of cruelty to animals, or any agent, humane law enforcement officer,
or representative thereof, which is involved in law enforcement or animal
control or in the monitoring of animal welfare and animal cruelty violations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Necessary veterinary care
means veterinary care to prevent the imminent death of an animal, alleviate
extreme pain for the animal, treat disease, provide basic, general care for the
health and welfare of the animal, and administer euthanasia and properly
dispose of animal remains, as determined necessary by a licensed veterinarian. 
Necessary veterinary care may include the administration of medicine and
vaccinations, but does not include surgical intervention, except if the
intervention is emergent to prevent imminent death, extreme pain, or loss of
the animals body functions.  Necessary veterinary care does not include surgical
intervention for elective surgery or for the general health care of the animal,
extreme health care measures, or invasive procedures not required to prevent
the imminent death of the animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Reasonable costs of
care&quot; means:  the cost of shelter, food, water, and bedding necessary to
house an animal; the cost of necessary care to improve an animal's psychological
well-being, including, but not limited to, training and enrichments designed to
provide mental and physical stimulation; and the cost of necessary veterinary
care for an animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  a.  Upon a
showing of a reasonable cause to believe that an animal cruelty violation has
been committed, a court of competent jurisdiction may issue, upon request, a
warrant to any municipal humane law enforcement officer, humane law enforcement
officer of a county society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, or other
State or local law enforcement officer, authorizing the person to enter onto
the private property where an animal is located and take custody of the animal. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection a. of this section, or any other law, or any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant thereto, to the contrary, a municipal humane law
enforcement officer, humane law enforcement officer of a county society for the
prevention of cruelty to animals, or other State or local law enforcement officer
may immediately enter onto private property where an animal is located and take
custody of an animal, without a warrant, if the officer has a reasonable basis
to believe that, due to an animal cruelty violation, immediate assistance is
required to protect or preserve the animal's life, prevent injury to the
animal, or provide the animal with necessary medical attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  As soon as practicable, a
municipal humane law enforcement officer, humane law enforcement officer of a
county society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, or other State or
local law enforcement officer taking an animal into custody pursuant to
subsection b. of this section, shall petition a court of competent jurisdiction
to order the holding of the animal in the shelter, pound, or kennel operating
as a shelter or pound, in which the applicable officer placed the animal, until
the adjudication of the animal cruelty offense and final disposition of the
animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    An animal taken into
custody pursuant to subsection a. or b. of this section shall be placed in the
care of a licensed shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound to
ensure the humane care and treatment of the animal.  If, after the animal has
been taken into custody, a licensed veterinarian makes a written determination
that the animal is in intractable and extreme pain and beyond any reasonable
hope of recovery with reasonable veterinary medical treatment, the animal may
be euthanized.  At any time while the licensed shelter, pound, or kennel operating
as a shelter or pound has custody or control of the animal, it may place the
animal in an animal rescue organization facility or a foster home, or otherwise
provide care to improve the animal's physical or psychological well-being,
provided the licensed shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound
determines that the placement at the facility or foster home or the provision
of such care:  (1) is in the best interests of the animal; (2) will not result
in additional and unreasonable costs of care; and (3) will result in euthanasia
only under the limited circumstances specified in this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The provisions of section
16 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.16) shall not apply to an animal placed in the
custody of a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound pursuant
to subsection a. or b. of this section, unless the animal is being held by the
shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound as a result of the
final disposition of the animal, following adjudication pursuant to this

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would:  (1)
authorize certain law enforcement officials to take custody of animals in cases
of suspected animal cruelty violations; and (2) establish various provisions
related to the payment of the cost of care of animals taken into custody.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) provide that a court of
competent jurisdiction may issue a warrant concerning a violation of P.L.2017,
c.189 after receiving proof of issuance of a written correction warning
pursuant to subsection f. of section 5 of P.L.2017, c.189 (C.4:22-17.7), rather
than proof of issuance of a summons;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   provide that a court of
competent jurisdiction may issue a warrant concerning a violation of P.L.2017,
c.189 without receiving the proof of issuance described above, whenever
immediate assistance is required to protect an animal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   specify that the notice
required pursuant to subsection c. of section 5 of P.L.2017, c.189
(C.4:22-17.7):  (a) must be sent no later than seven days after an animal has
been taken into custody; (b) must be sent to the owner as well as the address
from which the animal was taken; and (c) need not contain information
concerning the alleged violation that led to the confiscation of the animal;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   provide that a licensed
shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound, which has custody or
control of a dog, domestic companion animal, or service animal, because of an
alleged violation of P.L.2017, c.189, may provide care to improve the animal's
physical or psychological well-being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill would
authorize a court of competent jurisdiction to issue a warrant to any municipal
humane law enforcement officer, humane law enforcement officer of a county
society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, or other State or local law
enforcement officer to enter onto the private property where an animal is
located and take custody of the animal, upon a showing that there was a
reasonable basis to believe that there has been an animal cruelty violation. 
In cases where an officer has a reasonable basis to believe that, due to an
animal cruelty violation, immediate assistance is required, the officer would
be authorized to enter a private property and take custody of an animal without
a warrant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require animals
taken into custody in the manner described above to be placed in the care of a
licensed shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound.  The bill
would authorize these facilities to provide care to improve the animal's
physical or psychological well-being, or to transfer the animal in an animal
rescue organization facility or a foster home, provided the licensed shelter,
pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound determines that such placement
or care:  (1) is in the best interests of the animal; (2) would not incur
additional and unreasonable costs of care; and (3) would not permit euthanasia
except if a licensed veterinarian makes a written determination that the animal
is in intractable and extreme pain and beyond any reasonable hope of recovery
with reasonable veterinary medical treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would authorize an
animal care facility (as defined by the bill) that receives and cares for an
animal taken into custody in the manner described above to file a complaint in
the Superior Court seeking payment of the reasonable costs of care provided to
the animal.  The bill would establish various requirements for the form and
content of the complaint.  If an animal care facility demonstrates, by a
preponderance of evidence, that an animal was taken into custody either for the
animals protection from harm or for needed medical attention, and that the
complaint was served in the correct manner, the bill would direct the court to
award damages for the reasonable costs of care for the animal for the period
that the animal is in the custody of the animal care facility.  If the court
determines that the animal care facility has not established these facts by a
preponderance of evidence, no damages would be awarded, but the animal would be
retained by the animal care facility until the outcome of the animal cruelty
proceeding that led to the animal's seizure.  If the court determines that a complaint
was not filed in the correct manner, the animal would be retained by the animal
care facility, which could petition the court for a 30-day extension to refile
the complaint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes various
requirements concerning the way in which damages for the reasonable costs of
care for an animal are to be paid.  If a person fails to make a payment, as
required by the bill, ownership of the animal would transfer to the animal care
facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would provide that, if
a person liable for the reasonable costs of care under the bill is found to be not
guilty of the alleged criminal animal cruelty offense or is found not liable
for civil penalties for an animal cruelty violation that led to the seizure of
the animal, and if the person has made timely payments for the reasonable costs
of care, the person would be authorized to immediately repossess the persons
animal and to be reimbursed by the animal care facility for all of the reasonable
costs of care, except those related to necessary veterinary care, that were
paid by the person to the animal care facility.<span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>   However, the bill also provides that, if the person contests the
necessity of veterinary care provided as necessary veterinary care, the person
may request reimbursement of veterinary care costs that the person believes was
not necessary veterinary care, and the animal care facility will be required to
reimburse the contested costs if it cannot document the veterinary care was so
necessary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines necessary
veterinary care as veterinary care to prevent the imminent death of an animal,
alleviate extreme pain for the animal, treat disease, provide basic, general
care for the health and welfare of the animal, and administer euthanasia and properly
dispose of animal remains, as determined necessary by a licensed veterinarian. 
It includes the administration of medicine and vaccinations, but excludes surgical
intervention, except if such intervention is emergent to prevent imminent
death, extreme pain, or loss of the animals body functions.  Necessary
veterinary care would also not include surgical intervention for elective
surgeries or surgeries for the general health care of the animal, or extreme
health care measures or invasive procedures not required to prevent the
imminent death of the animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would
authorize animal care facilities and enforcement agencies (as defined by the
bill) to petition a court presiding over an animal cruelty proceeding for an
order requiring the forfeiture of the animal involved in animal cruelty offense
to an animal care facility.  The court would also be authorized to order that
the person convicted of an animal cruelty violation and any person who was
convicted for conspiring, aiding, or abetting in the violation that was the
basis of the conviction, be prohibited from owning, harboring, or having
custody or control of any other animals for a period of time that the court
deems appropriate.  The bill would also authorize the court to issue an order
as described above upon its own initiative.</p>
