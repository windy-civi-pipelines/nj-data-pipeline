However, other counties do not provide the blank municipal petition forms but instead provide a link or telephone number where the municipal candidate can contact the respective municipal clerk to obtain the form. Under this bill, the blank forms of petitions to be used by candidates to be voted for by the voters of a single municipality would be made available only from the municipal clerks of the respective municipalities where the nominated candidates are to be voted for. This would apply with respect to both primary and general election petitions.
