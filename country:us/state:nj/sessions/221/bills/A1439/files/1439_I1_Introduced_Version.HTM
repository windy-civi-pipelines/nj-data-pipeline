<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><sup><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>        </span></sup></b><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>1.   (New section)  The Legislature finds and
declares that:  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      a.   The
rising cost of insulin has created an affordability crisis that threatens the health
and financial well-being of many diabetes patients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      b.   Research
by the non-partisan Health Care Cost Institute found that prices for insulin
nearly doubled over the five year period from 2012 to 2016 and other studies
show that prices for insulin have increased by 700% over the past two decades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      c.   The
lack of competition, transparency, and accountability in the prescription drug
market has allowed manufacturers of insulin to exert extraordinary pricing
power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      d.   While
insulin products have been on the market for almost a century, there is limited
competition from lower-cost generics, in part due to aggressive efforts by
brand name drug manufacturers to block the entry of generic insulin products
into the market.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      e.   Even
consumers with health insurance may face a lack of access to insulin due to the
plan design of some health insurance policies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      f.    For
consumers without insurance, or with insurance coverage not subject to New
Jersey State law, access to current and reliable cost information may be
helpful to consumers and researchers trying to better understand the true cost
of insulin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      g.   It
is, therefore, in the public interest to protect consumers by mandating
insurance coverage cost sharing maximums in New Jersey to improve consumer
access to insulin, and to provide for transparency and publication of drug
company pricing of insulin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      2.   Section
1 of P.L.1995, c.331 (C.17:48-6n) is amended to read as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      1.   a. 
Every individual or group hospital service corporation contract providing hospital
or medical expense benefits that is delivered, issued, executed or renewed in
this State pursuant to P.L.1938, c.366 (C.17:48-1 et seq.) or approved for
issuance or renewal in this State by the Commissioner of <u>Banking and</u> Insurance
on or after the effective date of this act shall provide benefits to any
subscriber or other person covered thereunder for expenses incurred for the
following equipment and supplies for the treatment of diabetes, if recommended
or prescribed by a physician or nurse practitioner/clinical nurse specialist: 
blood glucose monitors and blood glucose monitors for the legally blind; test
strips for glucose monitors and visual reading and urine testing strips;
insulin; injection aids; cartridges for the legally blind; syringes; insulin
pumps and appurtenances thereto; insulin infusion devices; and oral agents for
controlling blood sugar.  <u>Coverage for the purchase of insulin shall not be
subject to any deductible, and no copayment or coinsurance for the purchase of
insulin shall exceed $50 per 30 day supply.</u></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      b.   Each
individual or group hospital service corporation contract shall also provide
benefits for expenses incurred for diabetes self-management education to ensure
that a person with diabetes is educated as to the proper self-management and
treatment of their diabetic condition, including information on proper diet. 
Benefits provided for self-management education and education relating to diet
shall be limited to visits medically necessary upon the diagnosis of diabetes;
upon diagnosis by a physician or nurse practitioner/clinical nurse specialist
of a significant change in the subscriber's or other covered person's symptoms
or conditions which necessitate changes in that person's self-management; and
upon determination of a physician or nurse practitioner/clinical nurse
specialist that reeducation or refresher education is necessary.  Diabetes
self-management education shall be provided by a dietitian registered by a
nationally recognized professional association of dietitians or a health care
professional recognized as a Certified Diabetes Educator by the American
Association of Diabetes Educators or a registered pharmacist in the State
qualified with regard to management education for diabetes by any institution
recognized by the board of pharmacy of the State of New Jersey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      c.   The
benefits required by this section shall be provided to the same extent as for
any other sickness under the contract.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes certain
findings and declarations concerning the rising cost of insulin and requires

Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Program to provide coverage

nothing in the bill is to prevent the State Health Benefits Commission or the
School Employees Health Benefits Commission from reducing an enrollee's

bill or from utilizing formulary management, including a mandatory generic
policy, to promote the use of lower-cost alternative generic drugs that are the
therapeutic equivalent of the brand-name drug.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lastly, the bill requires
insulin manufacturers to submit an annual report to the Commissioner of Banking
and Insurance containing certain information concerning the manufacture,
pricing, and sales of insulin products.</p>
