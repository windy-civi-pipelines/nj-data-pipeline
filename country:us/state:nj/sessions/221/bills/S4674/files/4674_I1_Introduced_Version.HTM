STATEMENT This bill establishes a voluntary gold and silver transactional currency system in New Jersey.  The bill creates an electronic currency system backed by gold and silver held in trust, providing an alternative transactional medium while maintaining existing monetary systems.  The bill designates the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance as the administrator of the system, with authority to contract with private vendors for implementation.  The bill recognizes qualifying gold and silver specie as legal tender under constitutional authority and creates electronic transactional currency backed by precious metals held in pooled depository accounts.  Participation in the system is voluntary with no requirement for acceptance of the currency by any party.  The bill provides full redemption rights for currency holders in either United States dollars or physical precious metals and includes security and anti-fraud protections.  Trust fund protections prevent legislative appropriation of backing assets, and the bill includes a delayed effective date to allow for proper system implementation and regulatory framework development.
