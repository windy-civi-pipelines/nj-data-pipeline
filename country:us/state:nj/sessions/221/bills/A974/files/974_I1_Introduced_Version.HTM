the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A taxpayer shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945,
c.162 (C.54:10A-5), in an amount equal to 50 percent of the cost paid or
incurred by the taxpayer on or after the effective date of P.L.    , c.   
(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) to acquire,
construct, reconstruct, renovate, or otherwise improve real property in this
State that is to be used by the taxpayer, or another person under contract or
agreement with the taxpayer, to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified
child care center primarily for the children of individuals employed by the
taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    To be eligible to apply
the credit allowed in accordance with subsection a. of this section against the
tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), a taxpayer
shall make and enter into an agreement with the director on or before the last
day of the privilege period for which the credit is first applied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The agreement shall require
the taxpayer to submit to the director all receipts, bills, invoices, and other
similar documents that the director determines to be necessary to verify the
costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The agreement shall require the
taxpayer to demonstrate to the director that the real property acquired,
constructed, reconstructed, renovated, or otherwise improved in this State is
not part of the principal residence of the taxpayer or part of the principal
residence of an individual employed by the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The agreement shall require
the taxpayer to demonstrate to the director that the real property acquired,
constructed, reconstructed, renovated, or otherwise improved in this State is
used by the taxpayer, or another person under contract or agreement with the
taxpayer, to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child care center
primarily for the children of individuals employed by the taxpayer on the date
the agreement is entered into.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The agreement shall require
the taxpayer to use the real property acquired, constructed, reconstructed,
renovated, or otherwise improved in this State to conduct, maintain, and
operate, either directly or indirectly by another person under contract or
agreement with the taxpayer, a qualified child care center primarily for the
children of individuals employed by the taxpayer for a period of 60 consecutive
months beginning on the first day of the first month next following the date
the agreement is entered into.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The agreement shall require
the taxpayer to notify the director in writing if, at any time during the
60-month period in which the real property is required to be used as a
qualified child care center, the real property is not used by the taxpayer, or another
person under contract or agreement with the taxpayer, to conduct, maintain, and
operate a qualified child care center primarily for the children of individuals
employed by the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The agreement shall require
the taxpayer to repay the amount of credit allowed in accordance with
subsection a. of this section that has been applied to reduce the taxpayers
liability for tax or that has been used as the basis of a tax credit transfer certificate
that has been sold to another person in accordance with subsection e. of this
section, and shall prohibit the taxpayer from applying any unused amount of
credit allowed in accordance with subsection a. of this section or from making
and filing an application with the director in accordance with subsection e. of
this section for a tax credit transfer certificate in lieu of the taxpayer
being allowed to apply any amount of the credit against the tax liability of
the taxpayer, if the taxpayer is required to notify the director of the
taxpayers failure to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child care
center during the 60-month period in which the real property is required to be
used as a qualified child care center; provided however, that the taxpayer
shall not be required to repay the amount of any credit, or be prohibited from
applying any unused credit, allowed in accordance with subsection a. of this
section, if the taxpayers failure to conduct, maintain, and operate the
qualified child care center during the 60-month period results from a casualty
loss, involving the qualified child care center, or if another person, under
contract or agreement with the taxpayer and the director, assumes the
taxpayers responsibility to use the real property to conduct, maintain, and
operate a qualified child care center primarily for the children of individuals
employed by that person for the remainder of the 60-month period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The agreement shall require
the director to assess the amount of any credit allowed in accordance with
subsection a. of this section that is required to be repaid by the taxpayer,
give notice of the assessment to the taxpayer, and make demand upon the
taxpayer for payment of the assessment to be made within 30 days of the date
notice and demand is mailed to the taxpayer by the director.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The agreement shall require
the taxpayer to pay to the director interest on an assessment, or any portion
of an assessment, that is not paid in full within 30 days of the date notice
and demand is mailed at a rate of three percentage points above the prime rate
assessed for each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at the end of
each year, from the date the credit allowed in accordance with subsection a. of

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides businesses
with credits against the corporation business tax and the gross income tax for
certain employer-provided child care expenditures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill permits businesses
subject to the corporation business tax or the gross income tax to apply a credit
against the tax liability otherwise due for a percentage of eligible
expenditures made to acquire, construct, reconstruct, renovate, or otherwise
improve real property to be used as a qualified child care center.  The bill
also permits businesses to apply a separate, additional credit for a percentage
of eligible expenditures made in connection with the provision of certain child
care services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
amount of the credit allowed for the construction of a child care center is
equal to 50 percent of the cost paid or incurred by a business to acquire,
construct, reconstruct, renovate, or otherwise improve real property in this
State that is to be used by the business, or another person under contract or
agreement with the business, to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified
child care center primarily for the children of individuals employed by the
business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
amount of the credit allowed for the provision of child care services is equal
to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     -- 50 percent of the cost paid
or incurred by a business to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child
care center of the business that is used primarily by the children of
individuals employed by the business;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     -- 50 percent of the amount
paid by a business to another person to conduct, maintain, and operate, under
contract or agreement with the business, a qualified child care center of the
business that is used primarily by the children of individuals employed by the
business;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     -- 50 percent of the amount
paid by a business to another person, under contract or agreement with the
business, for the provision of child care to children of individuals employed
by the business at a qualified child care center; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     -- 10 percent of the cost paid
or incurred by a business for the provision, by the business or by another
person under contract or agreement with the business, of qualified child care
information and referral services to individuals employed by the business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that to be
eligible to apply the credit for the construction of a child care center a
business must make and enter into an agreement with the Director of the
Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury. The bill specifies that
the agreement must require the business to demonstrate the intended use and
status of the real property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated, or
otherwise improved in this State, and require the business to use that property
to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child care center primarily for
the children of individuals employed by the business for a 60-month period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that, under
the credit for the construction of a child care center, a business may make and
file an application with the Director of the Division of Taxation for a tax
credit transfer certificate in lieu of being allowed any amount of the credit
against the tax liability of the business.  The bill specifies that, if issued,
the certificate may be sold to a another person that may have a tax liability
under certain other State taxes in exchange for private financial consideration,
but stipulates that the sale cannot be made for consideration of less than 75
percent of the transferred credit amount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines a qualified
child care center as a facility that is licensed as a child care center by the
Department of Children and Families, but specifically excludes from that
definition facilities licensed by the department if: the principal use of the
facility is for some purpose other than the care, development, and supervision
of children; the facility is not used on a regular basis to provide for the
care, development, and supervision of children; enrollment in the facility is
not open to children of individuals employed by the business claiming the credit;
or use of the facility is limited or restricted under procedures, criteria, or
other systems of selection that unfairly discriminate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill takes effect
immediately and applies to privilege periods and taxable years beginning on or
after January 1 next following the date of enactment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of this bill is to
encourage New Jersey businesses to take a more active role in the provision of
child care to employees and their children. Businesses that are active in
providing child care typically have a more engaged and productive workforce and
play an integral part in reducing the overall demand for quality, affordable
child care in this State.</p>
