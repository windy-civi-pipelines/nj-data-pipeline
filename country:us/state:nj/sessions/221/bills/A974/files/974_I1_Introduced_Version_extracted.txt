The agreement shall require the taxpayer to submit to the director all receipts, bills, invoices, and other similar documents that the director determines to be necessary to verify the costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer. The agreement shall require the taxpayer to demonstrate to the director that the real property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated, or otherwise improved in this State is not part of the principal residence of the taxpayer or part of the principal residence of an individual employed by the taxpayer. The agreement shall require the taxpayer to demonstrate to the director that the real property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated, or otherwise improved in this State is used by the taxpayer, or another person under contract or agreement with the taxpayer, to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child care center primarily for the children of individuals employed by the taxpayer on the date the agreement is entered into. The agreement shall require the taxpayer to use the real property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated, or otherwise improved in this State to conduct, maintain, and operate, either directly or indirectly by another person under contract or agreement with the taxpayer, a qualified child care center primarily for the children of individuals employed by the taxpayer for a period of 60 consecutive months beginning on the first day of the first month next following the date the agreement is entered into. The agreement shall require the taxpayer to notify the director in writing if, at any time during the 60-month period in which the real property is required to be used as a qualified child care center, the real property is not used by the taxpayer, or another person under contract or agreement with the taxpayer, to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child care center primarily for the children of individuals employed by the taxpayer. The agreement shall require the taxpayer to repay the amount of credit allowed in accordance with subsection a. of this section that has been applied to reduce the taxpayers liability for tax or that has been used as the basis of a tax credit transfer certificate that has been sold to another person in accordance with subsection e. of this section, and shall prohibit the taxpayer from applying any unused amount of credit allowed in accordance with subsection a. of this section or from making and filing an application with the director in accordance with subsection e. of this section for a tax credit transfer certificate in lieu of the taxpayer being allowed to apply any amount of the credit against the tax liability of the taxpayer, if the taxpayer is required to notify the director of the taxpayers failure to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child care center during the 60-month period in which the real property is required to be used as a qualified child care center; provided however, that the taxpayer shall not be required to repay the amount of any credit, or be prohibited from applying any unused credit, allowed in accordance with subsection a. of this section, if the taxpayers failure to conduct, maintain, and operate the qualified child care center during the 60-month period results from a casualty loss, involving the qualified child care center, or if another person, under contract or agreement with the taxpayer and the director, assumes the taxpayers responsibility to use the real property to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child care center primarily for the children of individuals employed by that person for the remainder of the 60-month period. The agreement shall require the director to assess the amount of any credit allowed in accordance with subsection a. of this section that is required to be repaid by the taxpayer, give notice of the assessment to the taxpayer, and make demand upon the taxpayer for payment of the assessment to be made within 30 days of the date notice and demand is mailed to the taxpayer by the director.

The bill specifies that the agreement must require the business to demonstrate the intended use and status of the real property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated, or otherwise improved in this State, and require the business to use that property to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child care center primarily for the children of individuals employed by the business for a 60-month period. The bill provides that, under the credit for the construction of a child care center, a business may make and file an application with the Director of the Division of Taxation for a tax credit transfer certificate in lieu of being allowed any amount of the credit against the tax liability of the business.  The bill specifies that, if issued, the certificate may be sold to a another person that may have a tax liability under certain other State taxes in exchange for private financial consideration, but stipulates that the sale cannot be made for consideration of less than 75 percent of the transferred credit amount. The bill defines a qualified child care center as a facility that is licensed as a child care center by the Department of Children and Families, but specifically excludes from that definition facilities licensed by the department if: the principal use of the facility is for some purpose other than the care, development, and supervision of children; the facility is not used on a regular basis to provide for the care, development, and supervision of children; enrollment in the facility is not open to children of individuals employed by the business claiming the credit; or use of the facility is limited or restricted under procedures, criteria, or other systems of selection that unfairly discriminate. The bill takes effect immediately and applies to privilege periods and taxable years beginning on or after January 1 next following the date of enactment. The purpose of this bill is to encourage New Jersey businesses to take a more active role in the provision of child care to employees and their children. Businesses that are active in providing child care typically have a more engaged and productive workforce and play an integral part in reducing the overall demand for quality, affordable child care in this State.

The bill provides that the amount of the credit allowed for the provision of child care services is equal to: -- 50 percent of the cost paid or incurred by a business to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child care center of the business that is used primarily by the children of individuals employed by the business; -- 50 percent of the amount paid by a business to another person to conduct, maintain, and operate, under contract or agreement with the business, a qualified child care center of the business that is used primarily by the children of individuals employed by the business; -- 50 percent of the amount paid by a business to another person, under contract or agreement with the business, for the provision of child care to children of individuals employed by the business at a qualified child care center; or -- 10 percent of the cost paid or incurred by a business for the provision, by the business or by another person under contract or agreement with the business, of qualified child care information and referral services to individuals employed by the business. The bill provides that to be eligible to apply the credit for the construction of a child care center a business must make and enter into an agreement with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury. The bill specifies that the agreement must require the business to demonstrate the intended use and status of the real property acquired, constructed, reconstructed, renovated, or otherwise improved in this State, and require the business to use that property to conduct, maintain, and operate a qualified child care center primarily for the children of individuals employed by the business for a 60-month period. The bill provides that, under the credit for the construction of a child care center, a business may make and file an application with the Director of the Division of Taxation for a tax credit transfer certificate in lieu of being allowed any amount of the credit against the tax liability of the business.  The bill specifies that, if issued, the certificate may be sold to a another person that may have a tax liability under certain other State taxes in exchange for private financial consideration, but stipulates that the sale cannot be made for consideration of less than 75 percent of the transferred credit amount. The bill defines a qualified child care center as a facility that is licensed as a child care center by the Department of Children and Families, but specifically excludes from that definition facilities licensed by the department if: the principal use of the facility is for some purpose other than the care, development, and supervision of children; the facility is not used on a regular basis to provide for the care, development, and supervision of children; enrollment in the facility is not open to children of individuals employed by the business claiming the credit; or use of the facility is limited or restricted under procedures, criteria, or other systems of selection that unfairly discriminate. The bill takes effect immediately and applies to privilege periods and taxable years beginning on or after January 1 next following the date of enactment. The purpose of this bill is to encourage New Jersey businesses to take a more active role in the provision of child care to employees and their children. Businesses that are active in providing child care typically have a more engaged and productive workforce and play an integral part in reducing the overall demand for quality, affordable child care in this State.
