<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  For privilege
periods beginning on or after January 1 next following the effective date of
P.L.    , c.   (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and
ending on or before December 31 of the fifth year following the effective date
of P.L.    , c.   (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), a taxpayer
shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) equal to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   50 percent of the amount
paid during the privilege period towards the purchase and installation of an
electric vehicle charging station that is used directly and exclusively by the
taxpayer in the taxpayers business, trade, or occupation, or $1,000 per
station, whichever amount is less; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   50 percent of the
difference between the amount paid during the privilege period towards the
purchase of a qualified commercial zero emission vehicle and the amount that
would have been paid for a comparable conventionally fueled vehicle, except
that the credit shall not exceed $25,000 if the qualified commercial zero
emission vehicle weighs less than 14,000 pounds, $50,000 if the vehicle weighs
14,001 to 26,500 pounds, and $100,000 if the vehicle weighs more than 26,500
pounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  To qualify for the
tax credits allowed pursuant to this section, the taxpayer shall file an
application for a certification from the Commissioner of Environmental
Protection.  The application for certification shall specifically indicate the
date of purchase of the electric vehicle charging station or qualified
commercial zero emission vehicle, the amount paid for the electric vehicle
charging station or qualified commercial zero emission vehicle, and, when
applicable, proof of completed installation of the charging station.  The
commissioner shall prescribe the form for the application and certification. 
The commissioner shall also provide a list of comparable conventionally fueled
vehicles for determining the amount of the credit allowed pursuant to paragraph
(2) of subsection a. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The Commissioner of
Environmental Protection shall have 90 days from the date of receipt of a
completed application to make a determination as to the issuance of a
certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Upon certification, the
Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall submit a copy of the
certification to the taxpayer and the director.  When filing a tax return that
includes a claim for the credit allowed pursuant to this section, the taxpayer
shall include a copy of the certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The director shall
prescribe the order of priority of the application of the credit allowed under
this section and any other credits allowed by law against the tax imposed under
section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  The amount of the credit applied
under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945,
c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period, together with any other credits
allowed by law, shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the
statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162
(C.54:10A-5).  The amount of the tax credits otherwise allowable under this
section that cannot be applied for the privilege period may be carried forward,
if necessary, to the seven privilege periods following the privilege period for
which the tax credit was allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    As used in this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Electric vehicle charging
station means a station that is designed in compliance with the State Uniform
Construction Code, adopted pursuant to P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.),
that delivers electricity from a source outside an electric vehicle into one or
more electric vehicles, and that is capable of providing, at a minimum, Level 2
charging.  An electric vehicle charging station may include several charge
points simultaneously connecting several electric vehicles to the station and
any related equipment needed to facilitate charging plug-in electric vehicles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualified commercial zero
emission vehicle means a vehicle certified as a zero emission vehicle pursuant
to the California Air Resources Board zero emission vehicle standards for the
applicable model year and is used to transport commodities, merchandise,
produce, refuse, freight, animals, or passengers as part a taxpayers business,
trade, or occupation, but shall not include an advanced technology partial zero
emission vehicle or a partial zero emission vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  For the taxable year
beginning on January 1 next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.  
(C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and for the four
taxable years thereafter, a taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the tax
otherwise due for the taxable year under the &quot;New Jersey Gross Income Tax
Act,&quot; N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. equal to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   50 percent of the amount
