Whereas, Perimenopause is the time during which a womans body makes the natural transition to menopause, often beginning about eight to 10 years before menopause; and Whereas, Perimenopause is a natural process caused by the gradual decline of ovary function and estrogen production, during which ovulation may become erratic, the menstrual cycle may lengthen, and flow may become irregular before a womans final period; and Whereas, Common symptoms can last for a few months to many years and may include: irregular periods or skipping periods; periods that are heavier or lighter than usual; hot flashes; vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex; urinary urgency; sleep problems; changes in mood; and depression; and Whereas, Perimenopause is a lesser known stage of the menopause process and individuals may not realize that the symptoms the person is experiencing are associated with perimenopause and may instead attribute the symptoms to ageing, stress, anxiety, and depression, which may result in the delay of appropriate treatment from health care professionals; and Whereas, October 11 is recognized as World Perimenopause Day with the purposes of educating people about mental health and the early signs of perimenopause and supporting women going through perimenopause who may feel lost; and Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper for the State of New Jersey to designate October 11 of each year as Perimenopause Day in order to support women going through perimenopause, to raise awareness of the realities of perimenopause and the available disease management options, and to combat stigma and misinformation concerning perimenopause; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  October 11 of each year is designated as Perimenopause Day in order to support women going through perimenopause, to raise awareness of the realities of perimenopause and the available disease management options, and to combat stigma and misinformation concerning perimenopause. 2.  The Governor may annually issue a proclamation recognizing October 11 as Perimenopause Day and call upon public officials and residents of the State of New Jersey to observe the day with appropriate activities and programs. 3.  This joint resolution shall take effect immediately.
