<span class=HangingAnActChar>concerning ranked-choice voting for certain State
and federal elections and supplementing Title 19 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:
150%'> </span><i>by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New
   Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Notwithstanding any
provision of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, or any other law, rule, or
regulation to the contrary, primary elections and general elections for the
offices of Governor, member of the New Jersey Senate, member of the New Jersey
General Assembly, member of the United States Senate, and member of the United
States House of Representatives, and presidential primaries and general
elections for electors for President and Vice-President of the United States,
shall be conducted using ranked-choice voting, an election method in which
voters rank candidates in order of their preference and the ballots are counted
in rounds and the votes or fractions thereof are distributed to candidates
according to the preferences marked on each ballot, in accordance with the
process established under this act, P.L.   , c.   (C.   ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act,
P.L.   , c.   (C.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Continuing candidate means
any candidate that has not been defeated or elected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Election threshold means the
number of votes sufficient for a candidate to be elected, which shall be 33
percent of the votes counting for candidates in an election for member of the
New Jersey General Assembly, plus one, disregarding any fractions, and 50
percent of the votes counting for candidates in an election for Governor, member
of the New Jersey Senate, member of the United States Senate, or member of the
United States House of Representatives, plus one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Exhausted ballot means a
ballot that is not counted for any continuing candidate because the ballot (1)
does not rank any continuing candidates, (2) contains an overvote by ranking
more than one candidate as the highest-ranked continuing candidate, or (3)
contains two or more consecutive skipped rankings prior to its highest-ranked
continuing candidate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Highest-ranked continuing
candidate means the candidate assigned to the highest ranking order on a
ballot that is not an exhausted ballot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Ranking order means the
number available to be assigned by a voter to a candidate to express the
voters choice for that candidate, with the number 1 being the highest
ranking order, followed by the number 2, and then the number 3, and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Round means an instance of
the sequence of voting tabulation beginning with paragraph (1) of subsection a.
of section 4 of this act (C.    ) for an election to the office of Governor,
member of the New Jersey Senate, member of the United States Senate, or member
of the United States House of Representatives, and for a presidential primary
election or a general election for electors for President and Vice-President of
the United States, or paragraph (1) of subsection b. of section 4 of this act
(C.    ) for an election to the office member of the New Jersey General
Assembly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Surplus means the total
number of votes cast for an elected candidate to the office of member of the
New Jersey General Assembly in excess of the election threshold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Surplus fraction means the
proportion of each vote to be transferred when a surplus of an elected
candidate is transferred, which shall be calculated by dividing the surplus by
the total votes cast for the elected candidate, using the formula surplus
fraction = (surplus of an elected candidate) / (total votes cast for the elected
candidate) calculated to four decimal places, ignoring any remainder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Transfer value means the
fraction of a vote that a transferred ballot will contribute to the next ranked
continuing candidate on that ballot in an election for member of the New Jersey
General Assembly, with each ballot beginning with a transfer value of 1, with
the transfer value of a vote cast for an elected candidate calculated by
multiplying the surplus fraction by its current value, calculated to four
decimal places, ignoring any remainder, and with the transfer value of a vote
cast for a defeated candidate being equal to its current value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    In any election
conducted by ranked-choice voting pursuant to this act, P.L.   , c.   (C.   )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill), the ballot shall be designed to
allow voters to rank candidates in ranking order, including write-in
candidates. The ballot shall allow voters to assign a ranking order to each
qualified candidate on the ballot. In the event that the voting equipment
cannot feasibly accommodate a ballot containing a number of rankings equal to
the number of qualified candidates, the ballot may be designed to allow a voter
to rank the maximum number allowed by the voting equipment, provided the ballot
shall allow the voter to rank at least six candidates. The ballot shall not
interfere with a voters ability to rank write-in candidates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.  In an election for the
office of Governor, member of the New Jersey Senate, member of the United
States Senate, member of the United States House of Representatives, and in a
presidential primary or a general election for electors for President and Vice-President
of the United States, the ranked-choice voting tabulation shall be conducted
pursuant to this subsection, and shall proceed in rounds, sequentially, as
follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   each ballot shall count
as one vote for the highest-ranked continuing candidate on that ballot. If a
candidate has more than 50 percent of the votes, that candidate is elected and

tabulation shall be conducted pursuant to this subsection. If, in the initial
tabulation, the number of continuing candidates is less than or equal to the
number of offices to be filled for the New Jersey General Assembly in the
legislative district, then all continuing candidates are elected and the
tabulation is complete. Otherwise, each round shall proceed sequentially, until
the tabulation is complete, as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   each ballot shall count,
at its current transfer value, for the highest-ranked continuing candidate on
that ballot. If the sum of the number of elected candidates and the number of
continuing candidates is equal to the sum of one and the number of offices to
be elected, then the candidate with the fewest votes is defeated, all other
continuing candidates are elected, and the tabulation is complete;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   if at least one
continuing candidate has more votes than the election threshold, then each such
candidate is elected. Each ballot counting for an elected candidate is assigned
a new transfer value by multiplying the ballots current transfer value by the
surplus fraction for the elected candidate, calculated to four decimal places
and ignoring any remainder. Each candidate elected under this subsection is
deemed to have a number of votes equal to the election threshold for the
election in all future rounds. A new round begins with paragraph (1) of this
subsection;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   if no candidate is
elected under paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the continuing candidate
with the fewest votes is defeated, and a new round begins with paragraph (1) of
this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      c.    In any round of
tabulation pursuant to subsections a. or b. of this section, a ballot that does
not contain a highest-ranked continuing candidate shall not count for any
candidate. Instead, the ballot shall be declared inactive and shall be counted
as an exhausted ballot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      d.   In any round of
tabulation pursuant to subsections a. or b. of this section, if two or more
candidates are tied with the fewest votes, and a tabulation cannot continue
until the candidate with the fewest votes is defeated, then the candidate to be
defeated shall be determined by lot. Election officials may resolve prospective
ties between candidates prior to the tabulation after all votes are cast. A tie
in the final round of tabulation in an election for the office of Governor
shall be decided in accordance with Article V, Section I, paragraph 4 of the
New Jersey Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a
ranked-choice voting procedure for primary and general elections to elect
candidates to the offices of Governor, New Jersey Senate, New Jersey General
Assembly, United States Senate, and United States House of Representatives, and
for presidential primary elections and general elections for electors of
candidates for President and Vice-President of the United States. Ranked-choice
voting is an election method in which voters rank candidates in order of their
preference, the ballots are counted in rounds, and the votes or fractions of
votes are distributed to candidates according to the preferences marked on each
ballot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the ballot
to be designed to allow voters to assign a ranking order to each qualified
candidate on the ballot for such offices, including write-in candidates. In the
event that the voting equipment cannot feasibly accommodate a ballot containing
a number of rankings equal to the number of qualified candidates, the ballot is
permitted to be designed to allow a voter to rank the maximum number allowed by
the voting equipment, but not less than six candidates. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, single-winner
elections to the offices of Governor, New Jersey Senate, United States Senate,
and United States House of Representatives, and presidential primaries and
general elections for electors of candidates for President and Vice-President
of the United States, would be tabulated in rounds. Each ballot counts as one
vote for the highest-ranked candidate on that ballot. If a candidate reaches
the election threshold of 50 percent of the votes plus one, that candidate is
elected and the tabulation is complete. If two or fewer continuing candidates
remain, the candidate with the fewest number of votes is defeated, the
candidate with the greatest number of votes is elected, and the tabulation is
complete. However, if more than two continuing candidates remain, the
continuing candidate with the fewest number of votes is defeated, and a new
round of counting begins until a candidate reaches the election threshold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For multi-winner elections to
the office of member of the New Jersey General Assembly, which include two
members elected from each election district, the bill establishes a tabulation
procedure that involves the transfer of vote fractions. Under the bill, if in
the initial tabulation the number of continuing candidates is less than or
equal to two (which is the number of offices to be filled for the New Jersey
General Assembly in the legislative district), then all continuing candidates
are elected and the tabulation is complete. If not, a series of tabulation
rounds would proceed sequentially until candidates are elected by reaching the
election threshold of 33 percent of the votes plus one. If the sum of the
number of elected candidates and the number of continuing candidates is equal
to three (the sum of one and the number of offices to be elected), then the
candidate with the fewest votes is defeated, all other continuing candidates
are elected, and the tabulation is complete. However, if at least one
continuing candidate has more votes than the election threshold, then each such
candidate is elected, and each ballot counting for an elected candidate is
assigned a transfer value so that the candidates surplus votes (beyond the
election threshold) are distributed to the next ranked continuing candidate on
those ballots. If, after these steps, no candidate is elected, then the
continuing candidate with the fewest votes is defeated, and a new round of
counting begins until the positions are filled as the remaining candidates
reach the election threshold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the Secretary
of State to issue guidelines and promulgate any rules and regulations necessary
to effectuate the ranked-choice voting procedures established by the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would take effect
immediately, but would remain inoperative until the January 1st following 12 months
after the Secretary of State officially certifies that all voting machines used
in this State have the capability to support ranked-choice voting. However, the
bills provisions concerning elections to the office of Governor would be
implemented if the voters approve an amendment to the State Constitution
authorizing ranked-choice for that office.</p>
