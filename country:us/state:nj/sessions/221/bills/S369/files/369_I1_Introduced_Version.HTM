Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Receipts of retail sales, except retail sales of motor vehicles, of alcoholic beverages, of digital products, and of cigarettes as defined in the "Cigarette Tax Act," P.L.1948, c.65 (C.54:40A-1 et seq.), made by a seller from a place of business located within a municipality, 99% or more of the area of which is located within the preservation area of the Highlands Region, as described in section 7 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-7), are exempt to the extent of 50% of the tax imposed under the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.).

STATEMENT This bill would provide a 50% sales and use tax exemption in any municipality 99% or more of the area of which is located within the Highlands Region preservation area.  Because of the State designation of the Highlands Region preservation area, the economic vitality of municipalities that are entirely or almost entirely slated for preservation is seriously undermined.  This sales tax exemption should result in maintaining the local economic base, preserve retail establishments and retain jobs in these municipalities.
