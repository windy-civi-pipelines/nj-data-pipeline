(3)   identifying the circumstances and timing of any expenditures made by the manufacturer to expand access to the drug or biological product and explaining any improvement in public health associated with those expenditures; and (4)   providing any other information that the manufacturer believes to be relevant to a determination as to whether a violation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) has occurred. c.    The Attorney General may require a manufacturer or a wholesale distributor to produce any records or documents that may be relevant to a determination as to whether a violation of P.L.    , c.    (C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) has occurred. d.   Upon petition of the Attorney General, a court may issue an order: (1)   compelling a manufacturer to submit the statement required pursuant to subsection b. of this section or a manufacturer or wholesale distributor to produce specific records or documents as requested by the Attorney General pursuant to subsection c. of this section; (2)   restraining or enjoining a violation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (3)   restoring to any consumer, including any third party payor, any money acquired by a manufacturer or wholesale distributor as a result of a price increase that violates P.L. , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (4)   requiring a manufacturer that has engaged in price gouging in the sale of an essential off-patent or generic drug or biological product to make the drug or biological product available to wholesale distributors, pharmacies, and consumers in the State, for a period of up to one year, at a price that does not exceed the price at which the drug or biological product was made available to such wholesale distributors, pharmacies, and consumers immediately prior to the violation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and (5)   assessing a civil penalty of up to $10,000 against a manufacturer or wholesale distributor for each violation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  For the purposes of this paragraph, each sale of an essential off-patent or generic drug or biological product at a price that constitutes price gouging shall be deemed to be a separate violation. e.     The Attorney General shall not commence an action seeking relief pursuant to paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection d. of this section unless the Attorney General has provided the manufacturer or wholesale distributor an opportunity to meet with the Attorney General to provide a justification for the increase in the price of the essential off-patent or generic drug or biological product. f.     Any information provided by a manufacturer pursuant to subsection b. of this section, or by a manufacturer or wholesale distributor pursuant to subsection c. of this section, shall be deemed confidential and shall not be disclosed to the public or otherwise subject to public access, inspection, or copying, unless such confidentiality is waived by the manufacturer or wholesale distributor. g.    It shall not be a defense to an action brought by the Attorney General pursuant to subsection d. of this section that a manufacturer alleged to have violated P.L.    , c.

The Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety may notify the Attorney General of any increase in the price of an essential off-patent or generic drug or biological product whenever:  (1) the price increase, individually or in combination with other price increases, would result in an increase of 50 percent or more in the wholesale acquisition cost for the drug or biological product or in the price paid for the drug or biological product by the State Medicaid or NJ FamilyCare programs within a one-year period; and (2) the wholesale acquisition cost of the drug or biological product is more than $80 for a 30-day supply or a full course of treatment.

The Attorney General may not commence an action seeking a court order for any relief, other than an order compelling submission of required statements or records, unless the Attorney General has provided the manufacturer or wholesale distributor the opportunity to meet with the Attorney General to provide a justification for the price increase.
