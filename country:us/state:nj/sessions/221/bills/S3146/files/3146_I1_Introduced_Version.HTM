STATEMENT This bill extends the expiration date of the special appraisal process provided by law for State-funded land acquisitions under the Green Acres program and the farmland preservation program from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2029 for lands located in the Highlands Region. The term special appraisal process refers to the process in which the State or other eligible participants are currently required by law to conduct two appraisals of lands that are proposed for acquisition, one of which is based on the property value on the proposed acquisition date, the other based on the value of the property as of January 1, 2004. The higher of the two values is used as the basis of negotiation with the landowner when determining the propertys final acquisition price.

Any rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall not apply to activities on lands acquired prior to the adoption of the rules and regulations. n. (1) The department, within three months after the date of the first meeting of the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council established pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-4), shall consult with and solicit recommendations from the council concerning land preservation strategies and acquisition plans in the Highlands Region as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3). The council's recommendations shall also address strategies and plans concerning establishment by the department of a methodology for prioritizing the acquisition of land in the Highlands preservation area, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), for recreation and conservation purposes using moneys from the Garden State Green Acres Preservation Trust Fund, especially with respect to (a) any land that has declined substantially in value due to the implementation of the "Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act," P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.), and (b) any major Highlands development, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), that would have qualified for an exemption pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 30 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-28) but for the lack of a necessary State permit as specified in subparagraph (b) or (c), as appropriate, of paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 30 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-28), and for which an application for such a permit had been submitted to the Department of Environmental Protection and deemed by the department to be complete for review on or before March 29, 2004.  The recommendations may also include a listing of specific parcels in the Highlands preservation area that the council is aware of that meet the criteria of subparagraph (a) or (b) of this paragraph and for that reason should be considered by the department as a priority for acquisition, but any such list shall remain confidential notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) or any other law to the contrary. (2)   In making decisions concerning applications for funding submitted by municipalities in the Highlands planning area, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), to acquire or develop lands for recreation and conservation purposes using moneys from the Garden State Green Acres Preservation Trust Fund, in the evaluation and priority ranking process the department shall accord a higher weight to any application submitted by a municipality in the Highlands planning area that has amended its development regulations in accordance with section 13 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-13) to establish one or more receiving zones for the transfer of development potential from the Highlands preservation area, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), than that which is accorded to comparable applications submitted by other municipalities in the Highlands planning area that have not made such amendments to their development regulations. o.    Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-1 et seq.) to the contrary, for State fiscal years 2005 through 2009, the sum spent by the department in each of those fiscal years for the acquisition of lands by the State for recreation and conservation purposes using moneys from the Garden State Green Acres Preservation Trust Fund in each county of the State shall be not less, and may be greater if additional sums become available, than the average annual sum spent by the department therefor in each such county, respectively, for State fiscal years 2002 through 2004, provided there is sufficient and appropriate lands within the county to be so acquired by the State for such purposes. (cf:  P.L.2019, c.136, s.8) 2.    Section 38 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-38) is amended to read as follows: 38. a. All acquisitions or grants made pursuant to section 37 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-37) shall be made with respect to farmland devoted to farmland preservation under programs established by law. b.    The expenditure and allocation of constitutionally dedicated moneys for farmland preservation purposes shall reflect the geographic diversity of the State to the maximum extent practicable and feasible. c.     The committee shall implement the provisions of section 37 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-37) in accordance with the procedures and criteria established pursuant to the "Agriculture Retention and Development Act," P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-11 et seq.) except as provided otherwise by P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-1 et seq.). d.    The committee shall adopt the same or a substantially similar method for determining, for the purposes of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-1 et seq.), the committee's share of the cost of a development easement on farmland to be acquired by a local government as that which is being used by the committee on the date of enactment of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-1 et seq.) for prior farmland preservation funding programs. e.     Notwithstanding the provisions of section 24 of P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-31) or  P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-1 et seq.), or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto to the contrary, whenever the value of a development easement on farmland to be acquired using constitutionally dedicated moneys in whole or in part is determined based upon the value of any pinelands development credits allocated to the parcel pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto, the committee shall determine the value of the development easement by: (1) conducting a sufficient number of fair market value appraisals as it deems appropriate to determine the value for farmland preservation purposes of the pinelands development credits; (2) considering development easement values in counties, municipalities, and other areas (a) reasonably contiguous to, but outside of, the pinelands area, which in the sole opinion of the committee constitute reasonable development easement values in the pinelands area for the purposes of this subsection, and (b) in the pinelands area where pinelands development credits are or may be utilized, which in the sole opinion of the committee constitute reasonable development easement values in the pinelands area for the purposes of this subsection; (3) considering land values in the pinelands regional growth areas; (4) considering the importance of preserving agricultural lands in the pinelands area; and (5) considering such other relevant factors, including the rate of inflation, as may be necessary to increase participation in the farmland preservation program by owners of agricultural lands located in the pinelands area. f.     No pinelands development credit that is acquired or obtained in connection with the acquisition of a development easement on farmland or fee simple title to farmland by the State, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization using constitutionally dedicated moneys in whole or in part may be conveyed in any manner.  All such pinelands development credits shall be retired permanently. g.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.70) h.    Any farmland for which a development easement or fee simple title has been acquired pursuant to section 37 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-37) shall be entitled to the benefits conferred by the "Right to Farm Act," P.L.1983, c.31 (C.4:1C-1 et al.) and the "Agriculture Retention and Development Act," P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-11 et al.). i.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.70) j. (1) Commencing on the date of enactment of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.) and through June 30, [2024] 2029 for lands located in the Highlands Region as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), when the committee, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization seeks to acquire a development easement on farmland or the fee simple title to farmland for farmland preservation purposes using constitutionally dedicated moneys in whole or in part, Green Acres bond act moneys in whole or in part, or constitutionally dedicated CBT moneys pursuant to P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) in whole or in part, it shall conduct or cause to be conducted an appraisal or appraisals of the value of the lands that shall be made using (a) the land use zoning of the lands, and any State environmental laws or Department of Environmental Protection rules and regulations that may affect the value of the lands, subject to the appraisal and in effect at the time of proposed acquisition, and (b) the land use zoning of the lands, and any State environmental laws or Department of Environmental Protection rules and regulations that may affect the value of the lands, subject to the appraisal and in effect on January 1, 2004.  The higher of those two values shall be utilized by the committee, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization as the basis for negotiation with the landowner with respect to the acquisition price for the lands.  The landowner shall be provided with both values determined pursuant to this paragraph. A landowner may waive any of the requirements of this paragraph and may agree to sell the lands for less than the values determined pursuant to this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable only to lands the owner of which at the time of proposed acquisition is the same person who owned the lands on the date of enactment of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.) and who has owned the lands continuously since that enactment date, or is an immediate family member of that person.

Any rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall not apply to improvements on lands acquired prior to the adoption of the rules and regulations. l. (1) The committee, within three months after the date of the first meeting of the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council established pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-4), shall consult with and solicit recommendations from the council concerning farmland preservation strategies and acquisition plans in the Highlands Region as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3).

(2) In prioritizing applications for funding submitted by local government units in the Highlands planning area, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), to acquire development easements on farmland in the Highlands planning area using moneys from the Garden State Farmland Preservation Trust Fund, the committee shall accord a higher weight to any application submitted by a local government unit to preserve farmland in a municipality in the Highlands planning area that has amended its development regulations in accordance with section 13 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-13) to establish one or more receiving zones for the transfer of development potential from the Highlands preservation area, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), than that which is accorded to comparable applications submitted by other local government units to preserve farmland in municipalities in the Highlands planning area that have not made such amendments to their development regulations. m.   Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-1 et seq.) to the contrary, for State fiscal years 2005 through 2009, the sum spent by the committee in each of those fiscal years for the acquisition by the committee of development easements and fee simple titles to farmland for farmland preservation purposes using moneys from the Garden State Farmland Preservation Trust Fund in each county of the State shall be not less, and may be greater if additional sums become available, than the average annual sum spent by the department therefor in each such county, respectively, for State fiscal years 2002 through 2004, provided there is sufficient and appropriate farmland within the county to be so acquired by the committee for such purposes. (cf:  P.L.2023, c.245, s.1.) 3. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill extends the expiration date of the special appraisal process provided by law for State-funded land acquisitions under the Green Acres program and the farmland preservation program from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2029 for lands located in the Highlands Region. The term special appraisal process refers to the process in which the State or other eligible participants are currently required by law to conduct two appraisals of lands that are proposed for acquisition, one of which is based on the property value on the proposed acquisition date, the other based on the value of the property as of January 1, 2004. The higher of the two values is used as the basis of negotiation with the landowner when determining the propertys final acquisition price.
