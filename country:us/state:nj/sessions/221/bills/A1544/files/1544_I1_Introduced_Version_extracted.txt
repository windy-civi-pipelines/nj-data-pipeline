Under the bill, a person convicted of this third degree crime is to be sentenced to: (1) a fine of not less than $2,500 for a first offense, $10,000 for a second offense, and $15,000 for a third or subsequent offense; (2) exclusion from all school or community sponsored youth sports events for a period of not less than two years and up to five years; and (3) participation in anger management training of a period of not less than 50 hours, subject to the discretion of the anger management training facilitator The bill provides that a person sentenced to a crime of the fourth degree for assault against a sports official or participant is to be sentenced to: (1) a fine of not less than $1,000 for a first offense, $5,000 for a second offense, and $10,000 for a third or subsequent offense; (2) exclusion from all school or community sponsored youth sports events for a period of not less than one year and up to four years; and (3) participation in anger management training of a period of not less than 20 hours, subject to the discretion of the anger management training facilitator.

The bill provides that a person who commits an aggravated assault against a sports official, player, or participant is guilty of a crime of the third degree and is subject to the additional penalties set forth in the bill.

A person also is guilty of aggravated assault under current law if the person commits a simple assault against certain persons, such as law enforcement officers, teachers, health care workers, and others. HARASSMENT. In addition, the bill increases the penalties for harassment if committed against a sports official or participant. Currently, harassment is a petty disorderly persons offense, punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 30 days, a fine of up to $500, or both. Under the bill, it would be a crime of the fourth degree to commit harassment against a sports official: (1) while the sports official is engaged in conducting, supervising, refereeing, or officiating at a sanctioned interscholastic, recreational, private, or collegiate sports event; (2) in the immediate vicinity of a sports event, if the harassment arises out of the sports officials performance in the sports event; or (3)  while the player is engaged in a sports event, and prior to and after the event.
