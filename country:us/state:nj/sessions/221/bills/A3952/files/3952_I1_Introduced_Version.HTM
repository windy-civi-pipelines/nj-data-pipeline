A3952 ASSEMBLY, No. 3952 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 4, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  MICHAEL INGANAMORT District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Fantasia SYNOPSIS Permits certain municipalities to appoint persons separate from civil service eligible list under certain circumstances. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning certain municipalities and civil service eligible lists, and supplementing chapter 4 of Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the contrary, when a municipality with no police department and having a population less than 12,000 according to the latest federal decennial census requests a certified eligible list from the Civil Service Commission, the commission shall provide the list within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request.  If the commission fails to respond to the request within 30 days, or an appointment does not result from the list, the municipality may appoint an otherwise qualified candidate for the position. The municipality shall sign a waiver designed and authorized by the Civil Service Commission exempting the candidate from the civil service hiring process. Upon accepting appointment, the candidate shall satisfactorily complete the working test period to be considered by the commission as qualified for the position and to have civil service status. The Civil Service Commission shall not require the municipality to replace the candidate upon issuance of a certified eligible list.  This provision shall apply regardless of whether or not the candidate is listed on the certified eligible list. For the purposes of this section, municipality shall mean and include cities, towns, townships, villages, and boroughs. 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the second month next following enactment, except the Civil Service Commission may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT Currently, when a municipality requests an eligible list of hires from the Civil Service Commission to fill a vacancy, it may take several months to receive the eligible list, and in the meantime, positions go unfilled. In addition, there are times when the list is received and either there are no suitable persons, or the persons on the list do not accept the position. Under this bill, when a municipality having no police department and a population less than 12,000 requests a certified eligible list from the commission, the commission must provide the list within 30 days from the date of receipt of the request. If the commission fails to respond to the request within the 30 days, or an appointment does not result from the list, the municipality may hire a qualified person.              The municipality will sign a waiver designed and authorized by the Civil Service Commission exempting the candidate from the civil service hiring process.  Upon accepting appointment, the candidate must satisfactorily complete the working test period to be considered by the commission as qualified for the position and to have civil service status.  The Civil Service Commission will not require the municipality to replace the candidate upon issuance of a certified eligible list. This bill will help reduce the number of unfilled positons in certain municipalities.
