STATEMENT This bill encourages the expansion of community mental health programs to include mental health services to veterans and prohibits veterans from being denied county mental health services. Specifically, the bill amends section 1 of P.L.1957, c.146 (C.30:9A-1) to stipulate that the public policy of the State is to encourage the improvement and expansion of community mental health programs in designated service areas in order to provide mental health services to veterans.  Current State public policy does not specifically stipulate that community mental health programs in designated service areas are to provide mental health services to veterans.

The provisions of the bill mandate that a veteran in need of mental health services who meets the eligibility requirements of a county mental health services program is not be denied county mental health services:(1) based solely on the persons status as a veteran, including whether or not the person is eligible for services provided by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs; or (2) while waiting for a determination of eligibility for, or the availability of, mental health services provided by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Under the bills provisions, a county mental health services program: (1) is to advise a veteran who may be eligible for mental health services through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs of their presumed eligibility for services, and refer the veteran to the appropriate county veterans affairs office for assistance with eligibility determination for these, as appropriate; and (2) may enter into a contract with a community-based veterans mental health services organization, where possible, to provide veteran-specific mental health services.
