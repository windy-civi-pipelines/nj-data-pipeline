<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  The Municipal
Landfill Upgrading and Infrastructure Improvement Grant Program is established
in the Department of Environmental Protection to provide financial assistance
to pay municipal landfill upgrading and infrastructure costs incurred by a
municipality, which costs are necessary to ensure that the municipality:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   comports with the
departments standards and regulations concerning the proper closure, capping,
and post-closure care of sanitary landfill facilities; and </p>

municipality seeking to obtain a program grant shall submit an application
therefor, in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner.  The grant
application shall include the following information:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a certification stating

available to finance the municipal landfill upgrading and infrastructure costs;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   a description of the
specific project or projects for which grant funding is being sought,
including:  the type of infrastructure improvement or other physical upgrade
being proposed; the reason why such infrastructure improvement or other
physical upgrade is necessary; the environmental and health-related impacts
that are expected to result from the improvement or upgrade; the total
anticipated costs of the project, including the total anticipated expenses
associated with the municipalitys ongoing maintenance and management of
completed project components; the permits and approvals that will required for
project commencement; and the anticipated dates on which the project will be
commenced and completed; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   any other information
required by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A grant awarded under
the program shall be used only to finance those municipal landfill upgrading
and infrastructure costs that are directly incurred and paid by the
municipality.  In any case where a federal agency is financing a portion of the
municipal landfill upgrading and infrastructure costs, the total costs used to
determine the amount of the grant to be awarded under the program shall be
reduced by the amount of the federal contribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Within 180 days after
the effective date of this act, the commissioner shall develop a project
priority system, which shall identify the ranking criteria and funding policies
that will be used by the department to prioritize projects for grant awards
under the program.  At a minimum, the project priority system shall provide for
the prioritization of those projects that will have the most significant
impacts with respect to enabling the ongoing municipal prevention, reduction,
elimination, or monitoring of pollution and other health hazards resulting from
an improperly closed sanitary landfill facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Each municipality
receiving a grant award under the program shall submit to the department, on an
annual or more frequent basis, as required by the commissioner, a grant fund
expenditures report that describes how the awarded grant funds are being used
by the municipality.  Each report shall be submitted in a form and manner
prescribed by the commissioner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish, in
the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), a Municipal Landfill
Upgrading and Infrastructure Improvement Grant Program.  The program would
provide financial assistance to pay municipal landfill upgrading and
infrastructure costs  i.e., those financial costs that are incurred by a
municipality in association with its implementation and ongoing maintenance and
management of infrastructure improvements and other physical upgrades to a
municipally owned and improperly closed sanitary landfill facility  which
costs are necessary to ensure that the municipality:  (1) comports with the
DEPs standards and regulations concerning the proper closure, capping, and
post-closure care of sanitary landfill facilities, which were initially adopted
on June 1, 1987; and (2) has the capacity to effectively prevent, minimize,
eliminate, or monitor pollution and other health hazards resulting from the
improperly closed sanitary landfill facility.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A municipality that owns an
improperly closed sanitary landfill facility would be eligible to apply for a
grant under the program.  The bill defines an improperly closed sanitary
landfill facility to mean a sanitary landfill facility, or a portion of a
sanitary landfill facility, at which operations were terminated prior to June
1, 1987 and for which performance is not complete with respect to all
activities associated with the design, installation, purchase, or construction
of structures or equipment, or with respect to the implementation of other
appropriate measures, as may be required by the DEP, pursuant to law, for
proper facility closure, including, but not limited to, activities involving
the placement or installation of earthen or vegetative cover, methane gas
vents, methane gas monitors, air pollution control devices, and leachate
monitoring wells or collection systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to any other
information that may be required by the DEP commissioner, an application for a
program grant submitted by an eligible municipality under the bill would need
to include:  (1) a certification stating that the sanitary landfill facility,
which is the subject of the grant application, is owned by the municipality and
was improperly closed prior to June 1, 1987; (2) a statement indicating the
total amount of grant funding that is being sought pursuant to the bill; (3) a
list of any other financial resources, including federal financial assistance,
that may be available to finance the municipal landfill upgrading and
infrastructure costs; and (4) a description of the specific project or projects
for which grant funding is being sought.  The project description is to
identify:  the type of infrastructure improvement or other physical upgrade
being proposed; the reason why the infrastructure improvement or other physical
upgrade is necessary; the environmental impacts that are expected to result from
the improvement or upgrade; the total anticipated costs of the project,
including the total anticipated expenses associated with the municipalitys
ongoing maintenance and management of completed project components; the permits
and approvals that will be required for project commencement; and the
anticipated dates on which the project will be commenced and completed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A grant awarded under the
program may be used to finance only those municipal landfill upgrading and
infrastructure costs that are directly incurred by a municipality.  In any case
where a federal agency is financing a portion of the municipal landfill
upgrading and infrastructure costs, the total costs used in determining the
amount of the grant to be awarded under the grant program would be reduced by
the amount of the federal contribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the DEP
commissioner, within 180 days after the bills effective date, to develop a
project priority system that identifies the ranking criteria and funding
policies to be used by the DEP when prioritizing projects for grant awards
under the program.  At a minimum, the project priority system is to provide for
the prioritization of those projects that will have the most significant
impacts with respect to enabling the ongoing municipal prevention, reduction,
elimination, or monitoring of pollution and other health hazards resulting from
an improperly closed sanitary landfill facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each municipality receiving a
grant award under the program would be required to regularly submit to the DEP,
a grant fund expenditures report that describes how the awarded grant funds are
being used by the municipality.  The commissioner would be required to adopt
rules and regulations that, among other things, specify the requisite content
of these expenditure reports.  The bill also requires the DEP commissioner to
annually submit, to the Governor and the Legislature, a written report on the
implementation and effectiveness of the grant program, which is to include,
among other things, an accounting of the appropriated funds that remain
available for future project grants.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would appropriate $10
million from the General Fund to the DEP for the purposes of financing grants
under the program.</p>
