<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill directs the Director
of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, in consultation
with the Commissioner of Education, to establish a program to provide tax
credits to taxpayers that make contributions to a selected student support organization
that awards scholarships for eligible students to attend participating
nonpublic schools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The program established by the
director would allow a taxpayer to claim a tax credit against the corporate
business tax or personal gross income tax equal to 75 percent of any
contribution made to a student support organization; in the case of the gross
income tax credit, a taxpayer is required to contribute a minimum of $100 to a
student support organization in order to claim a tax credit.  The value of a
credit for an individual taxpayer in a given year or privilege period is not
permitted to exceed the lesser of 50 percent of the taxpayers total tax
liability or $1,000,000 for a tax credit against the corporate business tax or
$100,000 for a credit against the personal gross income tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The maximum amount of tax
credits allowable in each State fiscal year may not exceed $37.5 million. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Director of the Division
of Taxation, in consultation with the Commissioner of Education, is responsible
for the administration of the program. The Director of the Division of Taxation
is to select one student support organization, draft regulations to implement
the program, and submit an annual report to the Governor and Legislature on the
implementation and results of the program.  The regulations are to include a
requirement that tax credits issued under the provision of the bill will be
issued equitably among the counties.  The Director of Taxation, in consultation
with the Commissioner of Education, is also required to establish a five-person
oversight committee to oversee the operation of the student support
organization.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The student support organization
would receive contributions made to the program, spending no more than five
percent of contributions on administrative costs, and distributing the
remaining 95 percent as scholarships for eligible families.  The student
support organization is required to verify student eligibility prior to
awarding a scholarship, not limit scholarships to students in a certain school
or region, award scholarships equally to all eligible students who apply in a
given school year, and provide a student with a scholarship that is not less
than the amount the student received in the prior school year. The student
support organization is to publicize the program, carry forward no more than 20
percent of funds each year, and submit an annual report to the State Treasurer
and the Commissioner of Education.  The student support organization is
required to contract annually for an independent financial audit of the program
and transmit a copy of the financial audit to the Division of Taxation, the
State Treasurer, and the Commissioner of Education no later than December 1 of
each year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To be eligible for a
scholarship from the student support organization, a student is to reside in
New Jersey and intend to enroll in grades kindergarten through 12 in the next
school year.  A student is required to have a household income that does not
exceed the federal income guidelines for reduced price lunch under the National
School Lunch Program multiplied by 2.6. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To participate in the program,
a school is to: be located in New Jersey; be a nonpublic school that is
eligible to participate in the National School Lunch Program; comply with all
federal and State anti-discrimination statutes; and comply with the
Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights Act, P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18:A37-13 et seq.). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also includes
language requiring that the provisions of the bill not supersede, impact, or
interfere with the full funding in each State fiscal year necessary to satisfy
the requirement of the New Jersey Constitution that the Legislature provide for
the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public
schools for the instruction of all children in the State between 5 and 18 years
of age; the full funding of the veterans $250 property tax deduction, required
to be provided to eligible veterans pursuant to the State Constitution; the
senior citizens and disabled persons $250 property tax deduction authorized
by the State Constitution; the full payment of contributions required by law to
be made to the State-administered retirement systems; and the full funding of
the Stay NJ property tax credit program established in P.L.2023, c.75
(C.54:4-8.75a et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No later than six months after
the conclusion of the fourth school year in which scholarships are awarded
under the program, the Department of the Treasury, in conjunction with the
Department of Education, any relevant governmental organization, and
stakeholders from the nonpublic school community, is required to submit a
report to the Governor and Legislature that will include: information on the
number of scholarships and the amount of tax credits awarded under the program;
recommendations on improvements to the program; and the number of nonpublic
school closures five years prior to awarding any scholarships under the program
compared to  closures after the implementation of the program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Department of Education is
required to establish a Student Support Grant Program to provide grants to
school districts in which at least 50 percent of the student population is eligible
for free or reduced price lunch under the National School Lunch Program.  The
grant funding is for student support services, including tutoring programs or
opportunities, teacher retention bonuses, or the provision of mental health or
counseling services.  The department will establish an application process for
the grants. As part of that process, the eligible school districts are required
to demonstrate how the funding will assist the district in providing needed
support to its students. The bill provides that the Legislature will annually
appropriate from the General Fund to the Department of Education $37.5 million
to fund the grant program.</p>
