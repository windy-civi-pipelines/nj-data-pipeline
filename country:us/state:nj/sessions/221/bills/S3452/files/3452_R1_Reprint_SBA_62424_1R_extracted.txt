S3452 1R [First Reprint] SENATE, No. 3452 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 17, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  M. TERESA RUIZ District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Senator  NICHOLAS P. SCUTARI District 22 (Somerset and Union) Co-Sponsored by: Senators Zwicker, Burgess, Gopal and Timberlake SYNOPSIS Requires health insurance and Medicaid coverage for family planning and reproductive health care services; prohibits adverse actions by medical malpractice insurers in relation to performance of legally protected health care services. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on June 24, 2024, with amendments. An Act concerning insurance coverage for 1family planning and1 reproductive health care and revising and supplementing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Given the historic and continued attacks on abortion access and reproductive health care at the federal level and in other states, it is critical that New Jersey take legislative action to ensure that all individuals in the State are able to exercise their fundamental rights to choose to use or refuse contraception or sterilization, to carry a pregnancy, to give birth, or to have an abortion, regardless of where 1[the]1 they are domiciled. b.    New Jersey has historically provided stronger protections for reproductive rights and 1bodily1 autonomy than are provided by other states and the federal government.  The New Jersey Supreme Court has made clear through several holdings, including Right to Choose v. Byrne, 91 N.J. 287 (1982), and Planned Parenthood of Cent. N.J. v. Farmer, 165 N.J. 609 (2000), that Article I, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution protects the right to abortion and reproductive autonomy to an extent that exceeds the protections established under the United States Constitution.  In 2022, New Jersey codified the fundamental constitutional right to reproductive autonomy, including the right to abortion, and has restored and allocated State funding to support reproductive health care services. c.     The Legislature is committed to ensuring that all individuals in the State can fully exercise their right to reproductive autonomy and can access affordable and timely reproductive health care services.  It is imperative to ensure that every person present in the State has the freedom to choose whether, when, and how to bear children on their own terms. d.    Access to reproductive health care is critical for the health and economic security of all people in New Jersey, providing all individuals in the State with the opportunity to lead healthier and more productive lives. To effectively vindicate the right to abortion and reproductive autonomy enshrined in State law, New Jersey must address barriers to access. e.     Financial barriers and costs associated with reproductive health care services can prevent people from accessing appropriate and necessary care.  These costs can threaten individuals financial security and negatively impact their long-term economic prospects. Cost barriers associated with reproductive health care often have a disparate impact on people who already experience barriers to health care access, including young people, people of color, people with disabilities, people with a low income, people living in rural areas, immigrants, and transgender or non-binary individuals. f.     A person's income level or their type of insurance should never prevent them from having access to a full range of reproductive health care.  The absence of funding should never be a reason that someone present in New Jersey does not exercise their fundamental right to reproductive autonomy, including abortion. g.    Health care practitioners should not be constrained from providing necessary or appropriate reproductive health care. Medically unnecessary regulations discourage practitioners from offering reproductive health care, including abortions, which effectively reduces the number of licensed providers, diminishes the availability of legal abortion providers, and creates harmful barriers and delays to care without providing any benefit to patients. Extensive scientific study has shown that abortion care is a safe medical intervention, safer than childbirth as well as many common medical procedures. h.    1Individuals' ability to choose their family size and the timing of children has led to notable health and socio-economic benefits.  Smaller families and better child spacing contribute to lower rates of infant and child mortality, improved economic conditions for women and their families, and enhanced maternal health. i.1    Given New Jerseys high priority to the preservation of health, the State has a significant interest in ensuring that every person in New Jersey can access reproductive health care, including abortion services.  The Legislature is committed to addressing barriers to receiving and providing reproductive health care in the State.  It shall therefore be the policy of this State to enable all qualified health care practitioners to provide abortion services in the State, and to advance insurance coverage and other methods through which to ensure that reproductive health care is accessible and affordable to all people present in New Jersey. 2.  (New section) As used in this act: Abortion means any medical treatment intended to induce the termination of a pregnancy and services rendered to facilitate the termination which may include follow-up care, except for the purpose of producing a live birth.  Abortion includes, but is not limited to, aspiration abortion and medication abortion, as defined in this section. Aspiration abortion means a procedure that terminates a pregnancy utilizing manual or electric suction to empty the uterus. Carrier means an insurance company, health service corporation, hospital service corporation, medical service corporation, or health maintenance organization authorized to issue health benefits plans in this State. Covered person means a person, or dependents of a person, on whose behalf a carrier offering the plan is obligated to pay benefits or provide services pursuant to the health benefits plan. 1Family planning and reproductive health care services means essential health benefits for maternity and newborn care pursuant to P.L.2019, c.354 (C.17B:27A-7.26 et al.) and shall include the following services: (1) abortion; (2) emergency services, which shall mean medical screening, examination, and evaluation for mothers and newborns by a physician and surgeon, or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by other appropriate licensed persons to determine if an emergency medical condition or active labor exists and, if it does, the care, treatment, and surgery, if within the scope of that persons license, necessary to relieve or eliminate the emergency medical condition, within the capability of the facility; (3) family planning counseling, which shall mean comprehensive reproductive health care services, including contraception, pregnancy detection, and options counseling; (4) family planning lab tests, including genetic testing and coverage for patients to see a licensed genetic counselor; (5) inpatient hospital care, laboratory, and ultrasound services for pregnancy-related services during pregnancy and during the postpartum period and for newborns; and (6) well-baby medical care. Family planning and reproductive health care services shall not include child birth for the purposes of this section.1 Medication abortion means the use, prescription, order, dispensing, administration, or any combination thereof as applicable, of a medication or a combination of medications to induce termination of pregnancy. Pregnancy means the period of the human reproductive process beginning with the implantation of a fertilized egg. Religious employer means an organization that is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.6033), as amended, and organized and operates as a nonprofit entity. 3.    (New section) a.  A contract that provides hospital or medical expense benefits and is delivered, issued, executed, or renewed in this State by a carrier or is approved for issuance or renewal in this State by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, on or after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall provide coverage for 1[abortion] family planning and reproductive health care services, as defined by section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)1. b.    (1) A contract subject to this section shall not impose a deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or any other cost-sharing requirement on the coverage required under this section. 1For services as described in paragraphs (4) and (5) of the definition of family planning and reproductive services, as defined in section 2 of P.L.    , c.
