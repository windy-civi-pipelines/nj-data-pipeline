A person or entity described in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection providing or receiving veterinary care without charge for a community cat shall attest in writing that the cat has no known owner. (cf: P.L.2010, c.89, s.3) 13.  Sections 3 and 4 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and C.4:19-15.31) are repealed. 14.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The bill, designated as the Compassion for Community Cats Law, provides for the spaying and neutering of stray or feral cats. In particular, the bill provides, with limited exceptions, that: (1)  no cat may be released for adoption from an animal rescue organization facility, shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound unless the cat has been spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian; and (2)  any community cat trapped and impounded at a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound, or trapped and taken to an animal rescue organization facility, must be spayed or neutered, ear-tipped, and vaccinated against rabies before being returned to the location where the community cat was trapped or given to a person assuming ownership of the community cat. The spaying and neutering requirements do not apply to a cat or a community cat that: (1)  is less than two months old; (2)  a licensed veterinarian determines cannot be spayed or neutered for other health reasons affecting the cat; (3)  is placed in a foster home or transferred to another shelter, pound, kennel operating as a shelter or pound, or animal rescue organization facility by a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound; or (4)  is to be euthanized in accordance with the provisions of section 16 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.16) and R.S.4:22-19, which provide for humanely euthanizing animals after a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound has offered the animal for adoption for at least seven days. The bill authorizes an animal rescue organization facility, shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound to charge the cost of spaying or neutering the cat to the person assuming ownership of the cat. The bill also amends various sections of existing law to allow for the implementation of the new spaying and neutering requirements established by the bill and other provisions of the bill.  The bill authorizes the Department of Health (DOH) to adopt regulations necessary to implement grant programs and fund the spaying and neutering requirements established in the bill. The bill establishes the Compassion for Community Cats Fund in the DOH to provide grants to municipalities and counties to establish programs to humanely trap community cats, and sterilize, ear-tip, and vaccinate them against rabies, and return each feral cat to the location where the cat was trapped.  The Compassion for Community Cats Fund is to be credited with the monies collected for violations of the bill, the surcharge on dog licenses imposed by section 1 of P.L.1983, c.181 (C.4:19-15.3c), any moneys appropriated by the Legislature, and any return on investment of moneys deposited in the fund. Finally, the bill repeals sections 2 and 3 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and 4:19-15.31), known as the Pet Sterilization Pilot Program." The committee amendments to the bill: (1)  correct cross-references and citations in the bill; (2)  correct typographical errors in the bills reproduction of existing statutory text; and (3)  delete a statutory reference to a program for aid to families with dependent children that was replaced by the Work First New Jersey program pursuant to P.L.1997, c.38.

All moneys in the "Animal Population Control Fund" shall be used by the commissioner exclusively for the implementation and promotion of the program and for the costs associated with the administration of P.L.1983, c.172 (C.4:19A-1 et al.), except as provided in subsection c. of this section. c.     Moneys deposited into the fund generated by the collection of application fees for animal welfare license plates issued pursuant to P.L.1993, c.184 (C.39:3-27.55 et seq.) shall be utilized by the commissioner to reimburse the Division of Motor Vehicles for all costs incurred by the division, as certified by the director, of producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the availability of animal welfare license plates.

For purposes of this section, core requirements means the continuing veterinary education determined by the board to be necessary to maintain currency in professional knowledge and skills in order to deliver competent veterinary care. b.    The board may offset up to 10 percent of the requisite number of hours of continuing veterinary education required pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1952, c.198 (C.45:16-9.4) by the number of volunteer veterinary services rendered by licensees, at a rate of one half of one hour of continuing veterinary education for each hour of volunteer veterinary services, provided that a veterinarian shall be required to complete at least the core requirements established pursuant to subsection a. of this section. In addition, the board may adopt a formula providing a minimum number of spaying or neutering procedures that shall be deemed the equivalent of one hour of continuing veterinary education. The board may reduce, in part, an application by a licensee to offset credits of continuing veterinary education pursuant to this subsection if the board finds, in its discretion, that the applicant requires continuing veterinary education in order to maintain or restore professional competence, or may deny all applications if the board finds that continuing veterinary education above the core requirements is necessary because of developments in science or technology. The board may also, in its discretion and for good cause, notify a veterinarian that the veterinarian is ineligible to offset credits of continuing veterinary education pursuant to this subsection for any other reason established by regulation by the board. c.     As used in this section [, volunteer]: Community cat means a cat, whether or not fearful of, or socialized to, humans, that has no known owner, lives and freely roams in the outdoors, and that may or may not be cared for by a person, including, but not limited to, by a person who provides food, water, veterinary care, or indoor or outdoor protection from the weather. Volunteer veterinary services means veterinary care provided without charge to: (1)   a person eligible for, and participating in, at least one of the programs enumerated in section 3 of P.L.1983, c.172 (C.4:19A-2); [or] (2)   a licensed shelter [or] , pound [licensed by the Department of Health and Senior Services or a municipally approved managed cat colony, provided that the municipality or nonprofit group or organization managing the cat colony has attested in writing to the veterinarian that the cat to be spayed or neutered or otherwise treated by the veterinarian is feral or stray with no known owner.] , or kennel operating as a shelter or pound; or (3)   a municipality, county, or nonprofit group or organization that is operating a program of humanely trapping community cats, and sterilizing, ear-tipping, and vaccinating the community cats against rabies before returning the community cats to the locations where the community cats were trapped. A person or entity described in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection providing or receiving veterinary care without charge for a community cat shall attest in writing that the cat has no known owner. (cf: P.L.2010, c.89, s.3) 13.  Sections 3 and 4 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and C.4:19-15.31) are repealed. 14.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The bill, designated as the Compassion for Community Cats Law, provides for the spaying and neutering of stray or feral cats. In particular, the bill provides, with limited exceptions, that: (1)  no cat may be released for adoption from an animal rescue organization facility, shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound unless the cat has been spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian; and (2)  any community cat trapped and impounded at a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound, or trapped and taken to an animal rescue organization facility, must be spayed or neutered, ear-tipped, and vaccinated against rabies before being returned to the location where the community cat was trapped or given to a person assuming ownership of the community cat. The spaying and neutering requirements do not apply to a cat or a community cat that: (1)  is less than two months old; (2)  a licensed veterinarian determines cannot be spayed or neutered for other health reasons affecting the cat; (3)  is placed in a foster home or transferred to another shelter, pound, kennel operating as a shelter or pound, or animal rescue organization facility by a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound; or (4)  is to be euthanized in accordance with the provisions of section 16 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.16) and R.S.4:22-19, which provide for humanely euthanizing animals after a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound has offered the animal for adoption for at least seven days. The bill authorizes an animal rescue organization facility, shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound to charge the cost of spaying or neutering the cat to the person assuming ownership of the cat. The bill also amends various sections of existing law to allow for the implementation of the new spaying and neutering requirements established by the bill and other provisions of the bill.  The bill authorizes the Department of Health (DOH) to adopt regulations necessary to implement grant programs and fund the spaying and neutering requirements established in the bill. The bill establishes the Compassion for Community Cats Fund in the DOH to provide grants to municipalities and counties to establish programs to humanely trap community cats, and sterilize, ear-tip, and vaccinate them against rabies, and return each feral cat to the location where the cat was trapped.  The Compassion for Community Cats Fund is to be credited with the monies collected for violations of the bill, the surcharge on dog licenses imposed by section 1 of P.L.1983, c.181 (C.4:19-15.3c), any moneys appropriated by the Legislature, and any return on investment of moneys deposited in the fund. Finally, the bill repeals sections 2 and 3 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and 4:19-15.31), known as the Pet Sterilization Pilot Program." The committee amendments to the bill: (1)  correct cross-references and citations in the bill; (2)  correct typographical errors in the bills reproduction of existing statutory text; and (3)  delete a statutory reference to a program for aid to families with dependent children that was replaced by the Work First New Jersey program pursuant to P.L.1997, c.38.
