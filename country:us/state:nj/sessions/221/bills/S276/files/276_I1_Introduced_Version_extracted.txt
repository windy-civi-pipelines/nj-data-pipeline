Under this circumstance, the bill requires a company to submit for recording, together with the deed, an affidavit identifying the name and business address of the registered agent for service of process of the limited liability company. The bill would also permit a municipality to direct, by ordinance, that charges issued to certain limited liability companies or foreign limited liability companies pursuant to a housing code, building code, or health code will become a lien on the property if the charge remains unpaid on the first day of the thirteenth month next following the date when the charge becomes due and owing.
