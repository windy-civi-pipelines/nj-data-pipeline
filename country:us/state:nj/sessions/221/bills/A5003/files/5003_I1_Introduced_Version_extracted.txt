but agreements entered into by the predecessors of the agency prior to the effective date of this act shall continue to be subject to any restrictions on rate of return imposed by prior law unless those restrictions are expressly modified pursuant to regulations of the agency.  No housing sponsor which is permitted by the provisions of the law under which it is organized or incorporated to earn a return on its investment, nor any of the principals or stockholders of that housing sponsor, shall earn, accept or receive a return on investment greater than the rate of return fixed by the agency in any housing project assisted with a loan from the agency, whether upon the completion of the construction, improvement or rehabilitation of the project, or upon the operation thereof, or upon the sale, assignment or lease of the project to any other person, association or corporation.  Any person, association or corporation who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree; (7)   No loan shall be executed except a loan made to a corporation or association organized not for profit which has as one of its purposes the development, construction, improvement or rehabilitation of housing projects or for mutual housing unless the housing sponsor agrees (a) to certify upon completion of project construction, improvement or rehabilitation, subject to audit by the agency, either that the actual project cost as defined herein exceeded the amount of the loan proceeds by [10%] 10 percent or more, or the amount by which the loan proceeds exceed [90%] 90 percent of the total project cost, and (b) to pay forthwith to the agency, for application to reduction of the principal of the loan, the amount, if any, of such excess loan proceeds, subject to audit and determination by the agency. No loan shall be made to a corporation or association organized not for profit or for mutual housing unless the corporation or association organized not for profit or for mutual housing agrees to certify the actual project cost upon completion of the project, subject to audit and determination by the agency, and further agrees to pay forthwith to the agency, for application to reduction of the principal of the loan, the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of the loan exceed the certified project cost subject to audit and determination by the agency.

(8)   No loan shall be made for the construction, improvement or rehabilitation of a housing project for which tax exemption is granted by a municipality unless the tax exemption remains in effect during the entire term of the loan, unless a lesser period of tax exemption is approved by the agency; [and] (9)   The loan shall be subject to an agreement between the agency and the qualified housing sponsor which contains a provision stating the prevailing wage rate, as determined by either the Commissioner of Labor and Industry or the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor in accordance with the provisions of section 42 of this act, which can be paid to the workmen employed in the performance of any contract for the construction or rehabilitation of any housing project, and which stipulates that the qualified housing sponsor, or any builder, contractor or subcontractor thereof, shall pay to such workmen not less than the applicable prevailing wage rate pursuant to that section ; and (10)  The agency shall encourage the participation of conventional lenders in the provision of construction and permanent loans in order to support the goals of the federal "Community Reinvestment Act of 1977," 12 U.S.C. s.2901 et seq.  The agency shall not adopt rules or regulations that create an unfair advantage for the use of agency financing over conventional loans, specifically in competitive programs like the federal low income housing tax credit program or restrict grant funds to projects only utilizing agency financing, especially when lower cost options for financing are available from conventional resources. b.    As a condition of any loan to finance a housing project, the agency shall have the power at all times during the construction, improvement or rehabilitation of a housing project and the operation thereof: (1)   To enter upon and inspect without prior notice any project, including all parts thereof, for the purpose of investigating the physical and financial condition thereof, and its construction, improvement, rehabilitation, operation, management and maintenance, and to examine all books and records with respect to capitalization, income and other matters relating thereto and to make such charges as may be required to cover the cost of such inspections and examinations; (2)   To order such alterations, changes or repairs as may be necessary to protect the security of its investment in a housing project or the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants thereof; (3)   To order any managing agent, project manager or owner of a housing project to do such acts as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of all applicable laws or ordinances or any rule or regulation of the agency or the terms of any agreement concerning the project or to refrain from doing any acts in violation thereof and in this regard the agency shall be a proper party to file a complaint and to prosecute thereon for any violations of law or ordinances as set forth herein; (4)   To require the adoption and continuous use of uniform systems of accounts and records for a project and to require all owners or managers of a project to file annual reports containing that information and verified in such manner as the agency shall require, and to file at the times and on the forms as it may prescribe, reports and answers to specific inquiries required by the agency to determine the extent of compliance with any agreement, the terms of the loan, the provisions of this act and any other applicable law; (5)   To enforce, by court action if necessary, the terms and provisions of any agreement between the agency and the housing sponsor and the terms of any agreement between the housing sponsor and any municipality granting tax exemption, as to schedules of rental or carrying charges, income limits as applied to tenants or occupants, or any other limitation imposed upon the housing sponsor as to financial structure, construction or operation of the project; (6) (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (7) of subsection b. of this section, in the event of a violation by the housing sponsor of the terms of any agreement between the agency and the housing sponsor, or between the municipality granting tax exemption and the housing sponsor, or in the event of a violation by the housing sponsor of this act or of the terms of the loan agreement or of any rules and regulations of the agency duly promulgated pursuant to this act, or in the event that the agency shall determine that any loan or advance from the Housing Development Fund pursuant to section 30 of this act is in jeopardy of not being repaid, the agency may, without resort to any judicial process, assume all of the powers and duties of the housing sponsor in the management and operation of the project, including but not limited to the power to receive all revenues and pay all expenses of the project and the power to control all property, including bank accounts and cash, owned by the housing sponsor.  The agency may appoint such person or persons whom the agency in its sole discretion deems advisable, including officers or employees of the agency, to perform the functions of the officers or other controlling persons of the housing sponsor.  Persons so appointed need not be stockholders or meet other qualifications which may be prescribed by the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or partnership agreement of the housing sponsor.  In the absence of fraud or bad faith, persons so appointed shall not be personally liable for debts, obligations or liabilities of the housing sponsor.  Persons so appointed shall serve only for a period coexistent with the duration of the violation or until the agency is assured in a manner satisfactory to it that the violation, or violations of a similar nature, will not recur.  Persons so appointed shall serve in such capacity without compensation, but shall be entitled to be reimbursed, if and as the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or partnership agreement of the housing sponsor may provide, for all necessary expenses incurred in the discharge of their duties as determined by the agency; and (b)   the provisions of section 18 of P.L. 1991, c. 431 (C.40A:20-18) concerning housing projects in financial difficulty shall not apply to housing projects financed by the agency; and (7)   The provisions of this subsection and this act pertaining to the regulation of housing sponsors shall be for purposes of protecting the collateral for any loan or loans; implementing or enforcing any condition, requirement or criterion for loans as provided in this act or other applicable law; and securing the rights and remedies of lenders and bond holders to the extent of the undertakings of the agency.  Subject to the foregoing, the agency shall permit, provide for and encourage the right of local housing sponsors to exercise their own initiative and competence in the administration of their assets and the conduct and operation of housing projects and exercise their rights and responsibilities to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Therefore, the agency shall exercise its remedies and powers under paragraph (6) of this subsection only with regard to material violations and only after reasonable notice and reasonable opportunity to correct the violation is provided to the housing sponsor in accordance with regulations adopted by the agency. c.     Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, the provisions of paragraphs (5) and (6) of subsection a. of this section shall not be applicable to market rate units. d.    As used in this section, "market rate unit" means a housing unit for which occupancy is not subject to limitations based on tenant income.

There may be included in the carrying charges to any family for residence in any mutual housing project constructed, improved or rehabilitated with a loan from the agency an amount equal to 6% of the original cash investment of the family in the mutual housing project and, to the extent authorized by the agency where not included in the carrying charges, the value or cost of repainting the apartment and replacing any fixtures or appliances. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no family or individual shall be eligible for admission to any housing project constructed, improved or rehabilitated with a loan from the agency, whose gross aggregate family income exceeds such amount as shall be established from time to time by the agency, by rules or regulations promulgated hereunder; except that with respect to any project financed by an agency loan insured or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, the agency may adopt the admission standards for such projects then currently utilized or required by the guarantor or insurer. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any housing project that the agency determines is necessary to promote the long term development and viability of a neighborhood and spur its revitalization or is situated in a qualified municipality that is constructed, improved or rehabilitated on or after the date upon which the commissioner determines that the municipality fulfills the definition of a qualified municipality pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-4).] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.     , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) b.    The agency shall by rules and regulations provide for the periodic examination of the income of any person or family residing in any housing project constructed, improved or rehabilitated with a loan from the agency. If the gross aggregate family income of a family residing in a housing project increases and the ratio to the current rental or carrying charges of the dwelling unit becomes greater than the ratio prescribed for admission [in subsection a. of this section] but is not more than [25%] 25 percent above the family income so prescribed for admission to the project, the owner or managing agent of the housing project shall permit the family to continue to occupy the unit.  The agency or (with the approval of the agency) the housing sponsor of any housing project constructed, improved or rehabilitated with a loan from the agency, may terminate the tenancy or interest of any family residing in the housing project whose gross aggregate family income exceeds by [25%] 25 percent or more the amount prescribed herein and which continues to do so for a period of six months or more; but no tenancy or interest of any such family in any such housing project shall be terminated except upon reasonable notice and opportunity to obtain suitable alternate housing, in accordance with rules and regulations of the agency; and any such family, with the approval of the agency, may be permitted to continue to occupy the unit, subject to payment of a rent or carrying charge surcharge to the housing sponsor in accordance with a schedule of surcharges fixed by the agency.  The housing sponsor shall pay the surcharge to the municipality granting tax exemption, but only up to an amount that together with payments made to the municipality in lieu of taxes and for any land taxes equals [25%] 25 percent of the total rents or carrying charges of the housing project for the current and any prior years that the project has been in operation. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any housing project situated in a qualified municipality that is constructed, improved or rehabilitated on or after the date upon which the commissioner determines that the municipality fulfills the definition of a qualified municipality pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-4). c.     For projects on which the agency has made a loan and financed the loan with the proceeds of bonds issued prior to January 1, 1973, any remainder of the surcharge, or the total surcharge if tax exemption has not been granted, shall be paid into the housing finance fund securing the bonds issued to finance the project for the use of the agency; for projects financed on or after January 1, 1973, any remainder of the surcharge, or the total surcharge if tax exemption has not been granted, shall be paid to the agency. d.    Any family residing in a mutual housing project required to remove from the project because of excessive income as herein provided shall be discharged from liability on any note, bond, or other evidence of indebtedness relating thereto and shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the rules of the agency, for all sums paid by the family to the housing sponsor on account of the purchase of stock or debentures as a condition of occupancy or on account of the acquisition of title for such purpose. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any housing project situated in a qualified municipality that is constructed, improved or rehabilitated on or after the date upon which the commissioner determines that the municipality fulfills the definition of a qualified municipality pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-4). e.     The agency shall establish admission rules and regulations for any housing project financed in whole or in part by loans authorized hereunder which shall provide priority categories for persons displaced by urban renewal projects, highway programs or other public works, persons living in substandard housing, persons and families who, by reason of family income, family size or disabilities, have special needs, elderly persons and families living under conditions violative of minimum health and safety standards.

(cf: P.L.2016, c.19, s.1) 9.    Section 31 of P.L.1983, c.530 (C.55:14K-31) is amended to read as follows: 31.  a.  The agency shall establish and maintain a fund called the "General Fund" which shall consist of all moneys of the agency not required to be deposited in any other fund of the agency, which the agency may deposit therein.  To the extent available, after paying all the operating costs of the agency, the moneys remaining in the General Fund may be used for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds issued by the agency or for such other corporate purposes of the agency as this act authorizes. b.    The agency may establish such additional and further funds as may be necessary and desirable to accomplish any agency purpose or to comply with the provisions of any agreement made by the agency or any resolution approved by the agency. The resolution establishing such a fund shall specify the source of moneys from which it shall be funded and the purposes for which moneys held in the fund shall be disbursed. c.     In the event the agency refinances or discharges any bonds which were used to finance an existing project, and the refinancing or discharge reduces the effective rate on the bond payments, the agency shall provide to projects participating in that financing a proportionate share of savings, including the calculation of administrative costs incurred by the agency in carrying out this section.  Commencing on the first day of the eleventh calendar year next following the issuance of a mortgage financed by the agency, project sponsors shall be permitted to repay any mortgage at any time without penalty, and shall be released of any remaining agency regulatory agreement upon repayment of the lien. (cf: P.L.1983, c.530, s.31) 10.  Section 37 of P.L.1983, c.530 (C.55:14K-37) is amended to read as follows: 37.  a. It is the intent of the Legislature that in the event of any conflict or inconsistency in the provisions of this act and any other acts concerning housing sponsors or any rules and regulations adopted thereunder, to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency, the provisions of this act shall be enforced and the provisions of such other acts and rules and regulations adopted thereunder shall be of no effect. b.    The governing body of any municipality in which a housing project financed or to be financed by the agency is or is to be located may by ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, provide that such project shall be exempt from real property taxation, if the housing sponsor enters into an agreement with the municipality for payments to the municipality in lieu of taxes for municipal services.  Any such agreement may require the housing sponsor to pay to the municipality an amount up to [20] 10 percent of the annual [gross] net revenue from each housing project situated on such real property for each year of operation thereof following the substantial completion thereof. For the purpose of this section, "annual [gross] net revenue" means the total annual gross rental or carrying charge and other income of a housing sponsor [from] minus utility expenses of and federal subsidy for a housing project.  If any such agreement is entered into from the date of recording the mortgage on the project to the date of substantial completion of the project, the annual amount payable to the municipality as taxes or as payments in lieu of taxes in respect of the project site shall not be in excess of the amount of taxes on the project site for the year preceding the recording of the mortgage.  Any agreement between any housing sponsor and a municipality pursuant to this subsection shall be submitted to the agency for review in order to avoid duplicating, overlapping or inconsistent regulations or provisions.  Any exemption from taxation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not extend beyond the date on which the eligible loan made by the agency on the project is paid in full. c.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b. of this section to the contrary, the governing body of a municipality may agree to continue a tax exemption for a State or federally subsidized housing project, beyond the date on which the eligible loan made by the agency on the project is fully paid, so long as the project remains subject to affordability controls pursuant to: (1) project-based federal rental assistance, authorized pursuant to section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. s.1437f), or other federal or State project-based assistance; (2)   the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency; or (3)   the rent and income limits established by the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program pursuant to section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.42). (cf: P.L.2019, c.297, s.2) 11.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill revises certain aspects of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (agency) laws to encourage participation by certified minority-, women-, and veteran-owned development firms.  The bill directs the agency to establish incentives and priorities to promote participation by minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses, so that a realistic opportunity exists for these firms to successfully participate in providing low- and moderate-income housing options to residents of the State.  The bill also specifically encourages the development of multi-family rental housing and home ownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income families by allowing participating developing firms to satisfy existing bonding requirements through a valid letter of credit or traditional performance bonding.  The bill also makes various procedural changes to help the agency carry out its housing priorities.

but the agency may make additional loans to a housing sponsor to which a loan by the agency for the cost of a project is outstanding if and to the extent that the agency finds that such additional loan is required to more adequately secure and protect the project or to avoid a default by the sponsor on the original loan for the cost of the project and is in the best interest of the agency and the holders of its bonds issued to finance the original loan for the cost of the project; (3)   The interest rate on the loan shall be established by the agency at the lowest level consistent with the agency's capital cost [of operation] and its responsibilities to the holders of its bonds;

and (10)  The agency shall encourage the participation of conventional lenders in the provision of construction and permanent loans in order to support the goals of the federal "Community Reinvestment Act of 1977," 12 U.S.C. s.2901 et seq.  The agency shall not adopt rules or regulations that create an unfair advantage for the use of agency financing over conventional loans, specifically in competitive programs like the federal low income housing tax credit program or restrict grant funds to projects only utilizing agency financing, especially when lower cost options for financing are available from conventional resources. b.    As a condition of any loan to finance a housing project, the agency shall have the power at all times during the construction, improvement or rehabilitation of a housing project and the operation thereof: (1)   To enter upon and inspect without prior notice any project, including all parts thereof, for the purpose of investigating the physical and financial condition thereof, and its construction, improvement, rehabilitation, operation, management and maintenance, and to examine all books and records with respect to capitalization, income and other matters relating thereto and to make such charges as may be required to cover the cost of such inspections and examinations; (2)   To order such alterations, changes or repairs as may be necessary to protect the security of its investment in a housing project or the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants thereof; (3)   To order any managing agent, project manager or owner of a housing project to do such acts as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of all applicable laws or ordinances or any rule or regulation of the agency or the terms of any agreement concerning the project or to refrain from doing any acts in violation thereof and in this regard the agency shall be a proper party to file a complaint and to prosecute thereon for any violations of law or ordinances as set forth herein;

(6) (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (7) of subsection b. of this section, in the event of a violation by the housing sponsor of the terms of any agreement between the agency and the housing sponsor, or between the municipality granting tax exemption and the housing sponsor, or in the event of a violation by the housing sponsor of this act or of the terms of the loan agreement or of any rules and regulations of the agency duly promulgated pursuant to this act, or in the event that the agency shall determine that any loan or advance from the Housing Development Fund pursuant to section 30 of this act is in jeopardy of not being repaid, the agency may, without resort to any judicial process, assume all of the powers and duties of the housing sponsor in the management and operation of the project, including but not limited to the power to receive all revenues and pay all expenses of the project and the power to control all property, including bank accounts and cash, owned by the housing sponsor.  The agency may appoint such person or persons whom the agency in its sole discretion deems advisable, including officers or employees of the agency, to perform the functions of the officers or other controlling persons of the housing sponsor.  Persons so appointed need not be stockholders or meet other qualifications which may be prescribed by the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or partnership agreement of the housing sponsor.  In the absence of fraud or bad faith, persons so appointed shall not be personally liable for debts, obligations or liabilities of the housing sponsor.  Persons so appointed shall serve only for a period coexistent with the duration of the violation or until the agency is assured in a manner satisfactory to it that the violation, or violations of a similar nature, will not recur.  Persons so appointed shall serve in such capacity without compensation, but shall be entitled to be reimbursed, if and as the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or partnership agreement of the housing sponsor may provide, for all necessary expenses incurred in the discharge of their duties as determined by the agency; and (b)   the provisions of section 18 of P.L. 1991, c. 431 (C.40A:20-18) concerning housing projects in financial difficulty shall not apply to housing projects financed by the agency; and (7)   The provisions of this subsection and this act pertaining to the regulation of housing sponsors shall be for purposes of protecting the collateral for any loan or loans;

(cf: P.L.2021, c.34, s.10) 8.    Section 8 of P.L.1983, c.350 (C.55:14K-8) is amended to read as follows: 8.    a.  [Admission to housing projects constructed, improved or rehabilitated under this act shall be limited to families whose gross aggregate family income at the time of admission does not exceed six times the annual rental or carrying charges, including the value or cost to them of heat, light, water, sewerage, parking facilities and cooking fuel, of the dwellings that may be furnished to such families, or seven times those charges if there are three or more dependents. There may be included in the carrying charges to any family for residence in any mutual housing project constructed, improved or rehabilitated with a loan from the agency an amount equal to 6% of the original cash investment of the family in the mutual housing project and, to the extent authorized by the agency where not included in the carrying charges, the value or cost of repainting the apartment and replacing any fixtures or appliances. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no family or individual shall be eligible for admission to any housing project constructed, improved or rehabilitated with a loan from the agency, whose gross aggregate family income exceeds such amount as shall be established from time to time by the agency, by rules or regulations promulgated hereunder; except that with respect to any project financed by an agency loan insured or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, the agency may adopt the admission standards for such projects then currently utilized or required by the guarantor or insurer. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any housing project that the agency determines is necessary to promote the long term development and viability of a neighborhood and spur its revitalization or is situated in a qualified municipality that is constructed, improved or rehabilitated on or after the date upon which the commissioner determines that the municipality fulfills the definition of a qualified municipality pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-4).] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.     , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) b.    The agency shall by rules and regulations provide for the periodic examination of the income of any person or family residing in any housing project constructed, improved or rehabilitated with a loan from the agency. If the gross aggregate family income of a family residing in a housing project increases and the ratio to the current rental or carrying charges of the dwelling unit becomes greater than the ratio prescribed for admission [in subsection a. of this section] but is not more than [25%] 25 percent above the family income so prescribed for admission to the project, the owner or managing agent of the housing project shall permit the family to continue to occupy the unit.  The agency or (with the approval of the agency) the housing sponsor of any housing project constructed, improved or rehabilitated with a loan from the agency, may terminate the tenancy or interest of any family residing in the housing project whose gross aggregate family income exceeds by [25%] 25 percent or more the amount prescribed herein and which continues to do so for a period of six months or more; but no tenancy or interest of any such family in any such housing project shall be terminated except upon reasonable notice and opportunity to obtain suitable alternate housing, in accordance with rules and regulations of the agency; and any such family, with the approval of the agency, may be permitted to continue to occupy the unit, subject to payment of a rent or carrying charge surcharge to the housing sponsor in accordance with a schedule of surcharges fixed by the agency.  The housing sponsor shall pay the surcharge to the municipality granting tax exemption, but only up to an amount that together with payments made to the municipality in lieu of taxes and for any land taxes equals [25%] 25 percent of the total rents or carrying charges of the housing project for the current and any prior years that the project has been in operation. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any housing project situated in a qualified municipality that is constructed, improved or rehabilitated on or after the date upon which the commissioner determines that the municipality fulfills the definition of a qualified municipality pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-4). c.     For projects on which the agency has made a loan and financed the loan with the proceeds of bonds issued prior to January 1, 1973, any remainder of the surcharge, or the total surcharge if tax exemption has not been granted, shall be paid into the housing finance fund securing the bonds issued to finance the project for the use of the agency; for projects financed on or after January 1, 1973, any remainder of the surcharge, or the total surcharge if tax exemption has not been granted, shall be paid to the agency. d.    Any family residing in a mutual housing project required to remove from the project because of excessive income as herein provided shall be discharged from liability on any note, bond, or other evidence of indebtedness relating thereto and shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the rules of the agency, for all sums paid by the family to the housing sponsor on account of the purchase of stock or debentures as a condition of occupancy or on account of the acquisition of title for such purpose. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any housing project situated in a qualified municipality that is constructed, improved or rehabilitated on or after the date upon which the commissioner determines that the municipality fulfills the definition of a qualified municipality pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-4). e.     The agency shall establish admission rules and regulations for any housing project financed in whole or in part by loans authorized hereunder which shall provide priority categories for persons displaced by urban renewal projects, highway programs or other public works, persons living in substandard housing, persons and families who, by reason of family income, family size or disabilities, have special needs, elderly persons and families living under conditions violative of minimum health and safety standards. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any housing project situated in a qualified municipality that is constructed, improved or rehabilitated on or after the date upon which the commissioner determines that the municipality fulfills the definition of a qualified municipality pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-4). f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of this section, the Commissioner of Community Affairs, in consultation with the Adjutant General of Military and Veterans' Affairs, shall promulgate admission rules and regulations for any housing project, financed in whole or in part by loans authorized hereunder, to provide a housing preference for veterans and surviving spouses, as those terms are defined under subsection (h) of section 1 of P.L.1963, c.171 (C.54:4-8.10), who qualify for public housing assistance, and for the spouses of veterans who currently so qualify. (cf: P.L.2016, c.19, s.1) 9.    Section 31 of P.L.1983, c.530 (C.55:14K-31) is amended to read as follows: 31.  a.  The agency shall establish and maintain a fund called the "General Fund" which shall consist of all moneys of the agency not required to be deposited in any other fund of the agency, which the agency may deposit therein.  To the extent available, after paying all the operating costs of the agency, the moneys remaining in the General Fund may be used for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds issued by the agency or for such other corporate purposes of the agency as this act authorizes. b.    The agency may establish such additional and further funds as may be necessary and desirable to accomplish any agency purpose or to comply with the provisions of any agreement made by the agency or any resolution approved by the agency. The resolution establishing such a fund shall specify the source of moneys from which it shall be funded and the purposes for which moneys held in the fund shall be disbursed. c.     In the event the agency refinances or discharges any bonds which were used to finance an existing project, and the refinancing or discharge reduces the effective rate on the bond payments, the agency shall provide to projects participating in that financing a proportionate share of savings, including the calculation of administrative costs incurred by the agency in carrying out this section.  Commencing on the first day of the eleventh calendar year next following the issuance of a mortgage financed by the agency, project sponsors shall be permitted to repay any mortgage at any time without penalty, and shall be released of any remaining agency regulatory agreement upon repayment of the lien. (cf: P.L.1983, c.530, s.31) 10.  Section 37 of P.L.1983, c.530 (C.55:14K-37) is amended to read as follows: 37.  a. It is the intent of the Legislature that in the event of any conflict or inconsistency in the provisions of this act and any other acts concerning housing sponsors or any rules and regulations adopted thereunder, to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency, the provisions of this act shall be enforced and the provisions of such other acts and rules and regulations adopted thereunder shall be of no effect. b.    The governing body of any municipality in which a housing project financed or to be financed by the agency is or is to be located may by ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, provide that such project shall be exempt from real property taxation, if the housing sponsor enters into an agreement with the municipality for payments to the municipality in lieu of taxes for municipal services.  Any such agreement may require the housing sponsor to pay to the municipality an amount up to [20] 10 percent of the annual [gross] net revenue from each housing project situated on such real property for each year of operation thereof following the substantial completion thereof. For the purpose of this section, "annual [gross] net revenue" means the total annual gross rental or carrying charge and other income of a housing sponsor [from] minus utility expenses of and federal subsidy for a housing project.  If any such agreement is entered into from the date of recording the mortgage on the project to the date of substantial completion of the project, the annual amount payable to the municipality as taxes or as payments in lieu of taxes in respect of the project site shall not be in excess of the amount of taxes on the project site for the year preceding the recording of the mortgage.  Any agreement between any housing sponsor and a municipality pursuant to this subsection shall be submitted to the agency for review in order to avoid duplicating, overlapping or inconsistent regulations or provisions.  Any exemption from taxation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not extend beyond the date on which the eligible loan made by the agency on the project is paid in full. c.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b. of this section to the contrary, the governing body of a municipality may agree to continue a tax exemption for a State or federally subsidized housing project, beyond the date on which the eligible loan made by the agency on the project is fully paid, so long as the project remains subject to affordability controls pursuant to: (1) project-based federal rental assistance, authorized pursuant to section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. s.1437f), or other federal or State project-based assistance; (2)   the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency; or (3)   the rent and income limits established by the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program pursuant to section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.42). (cf: P.L.2019, c.297, s.2) 11.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill revises certain aspects of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (agency) laws to encourage participation by certified minority-, women-, and veteran-owned development firms.  The bill directs the agency to establish incentives and priorities to promote participation by minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses, so that a realistic opportunity exists for these firms to successfully participate in providing low- and moderate-income housing options to residents of the State.  The bill also specifically encourages the development of multi-family rental housing and home ownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income families by allowing participating developing firms to satisfy existing bonding requirements through a valid letter of credit or traditional performance bonding.  The bill also makes various procedural changes to help the agency carry out its housing priorities.
