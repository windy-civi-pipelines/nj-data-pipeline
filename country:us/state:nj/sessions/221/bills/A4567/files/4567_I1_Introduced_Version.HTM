the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 25 of P.L.1982,
c.77 (C.2A:4A-44) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2A:4A-44.  Incarceration -
Aggravating and mitigating factors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     25.  Incarceration--Aggravating
and mitigating factors  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  (1) In determining whether
incarceration is an appropriate disposition and in addition to the
considerations set forth in subsection i. of section 2 of P.L.1982, c.77
(C.2A:4A-21), the court shall consider the following aggravating
circumstances:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The fact that the nature
and circumstances of the act, and the role of the juvenile therein, was
committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The fact that there was
grave and serious harm inflicted on the victim and that based upon the
juvenile's age or mental capacity the juvenile knew or reasonably should have
known that the victim was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance
due to advanced age, disability, ill-health, or extreme youth, or was for any
other reason substantially incapable; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   The character and
attitude of the juvenile indicate that the juvenile is likely to commit another
delinquent or criminal act; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   The juvenile's prior
record and the seriousness of any acts for which the juvenile has been
adjudicated delinquent; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   The fact that the
juvenile committed the act pursuant to an agreement that the juvenile either
pay or be paid for the commission of the act and that the pecuniary incentive
was beyond that inherent in the act itself;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   The fact that the
juvenile committed the act against a policeman or other law enforcement
officer, correctional employee or fireman, acting in the performance of his
duties while in uniform or exhibiting evidence of his authority, or the
juvenile committed the act because of the status of the victim as a public
servant; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   The need for deterring
the juvenile and others from violating the law; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)   The fact that the
juvenile knowingly conspired with others as an organizer, supervisor, or
manager to commit continuing criminal activity in concert with two or more
persons and the circumstances of the crime show that he has knowingly devoted
himself to criminal activity as part of an ongoing business activity; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    The fact that the
juvenile on two separate occasions was adjudged a delinquent on the basis of
acts which if committed by an adult would constitute crimes; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (j)    The impact of the
offense on the victim or victims; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (k)   The impact of the
offense on the community; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (l)    The threat to the
safety of the public or any individual posed by the child.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In determining whether
incarceration is an appropriate disposition the court shall consider the
following mitigating circumstances:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The child is under the
age of 14; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The juvenile's conduct
neither caused nor threatened serious harm; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   The juvenile did not
contemplate that the juvenile's conduct would cause or threaten serious harm; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   The juvenile acted under
a strong provocation; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   There were substantial
grounds tending to excuse or justify the juvenile's conduct, though failing to establish
a defense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   The victim of the
juvenile's conduct induced or facilitated its commission; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   The juvenile has
compensated or will compensate the victim for the damage or injury that the
victim has sustained, or will participate in a program of community service; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)   The juvenile has no
history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law-abiding life
for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present act; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    The juvenile's conduct
was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (j)    The character and
attitude of the juvenile indicate that the juvenile is unlikely to commit
another delinquent or criminal act; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (k)   The juvenile is
particularly likely to respond affirmatively to noncustodial treatment; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (l)    The separation of the
juvenile from the juvenile's family by incarceration of the juvenile would
entail excessive hardship to the juvenile or the juvenile's family; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (m)  The willingness of the
juvenile to cooperate with law enforcement authorities; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (n)   The conduct of the
juvenile was substantially influenced by another person more mature than the
juvenile.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  (1)  There shall be a
presumption of nonincarceration for any crime or offense of the fourth degree

delinquent or convicted of a crime or offense. </p>

imposed, the court and a panel comprised of at least two members of the
Juvenile Justice Commission designated by the executive director and a member
of the State Parole Board designated by the chairman shall consider the
juvenile's eligibility for release pursuant to the provisions of subsection d.
of this section.  <u>The juvenile shall be represented by the Office of the
Public Defender at all parole proceedings, unless the juvenile chooses to be
represented by pro bono counsel or retains private counsel at the juveniles
expense.  If the juvenile is represented by pro bono counsel, the counsel representing
the juvenile shall have experience in juvenile justice.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The following juveniles
shall not be committed to a State juvenile facility: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Juveniles age 11 or
under unless adjudicated delinquent for the crime of arson or a crime which, if
committed by an adult, would be a crime of the first or second degree; and </p>

developmentally disabled as defined in paragraph (1) of subsection a. of
section 3 of P.L.1977, c.82 (C.30:6D-3). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1) When the court
determines that, based on the consideration of all the factors set forth in
subsection a., the juvenile shall be incarcerated, unless it orders the
incarceration pursuant to subsection c. of section 24 of P.L.1982, c.77
(C.2A:4A-43), it shall state on the record the reasons for imposing
incarceration, including any findings with regard to these factors, and commit
the juvenile to the custody of the Juvenile Justice Commission which shall
provide for the juvenile's placement in a suitable juvenile facility pursuant
to the conditions set forth in this subsection and for terms not to exceed the

confinement shall continue until the panel established pursuant to subsection
b. of this section determines that the person is eligible for early release on
parole or until expiration of the term of confinement, whichever shall occur
first; except that in no case shall the period of confinement and parole exceed
the maximum provided by law for the offense.  A juvenile shall be granted early
release on parole when it appears that the juvenile has made substantial
progress toward positive behavioral adjustment and rehabilitative goals
articulated by the panel established pursuant to subsection b. of this section
to the juvenile.  <u>In making the determination of whether the juvenile shall
be granted early release on parole, the panel also shall consider any
additional evidence of maturity or rehabilitation presented by the juvenile or
the juveniles counsel and take into consideration the information provided
during the training required pursuant to subsection h. of this section regarding
the age-crime curve and aging out of crime.</u>  However, if a juvenile is
approved for parole by the panel established pursuant to subsection b. of this
section prior to serving one-third of any term imposed for any crime of the
first, second, or third degree, including any extended term imposed pursuant to
paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection, or one-fourth of any term imposed for
any other crime the granting of parole shall be subject to approval of the
sentencing court.  Prior to approving parole, the court shall give the
prosecuting attorney notice and an opportunity to be heard.  If the court
denies the parole of a juvenile pursuant to this paragraph it shall state its
reasons in writing and notify the panel established pursuant to subsection b.
of this section, the juvenile, and the juvenile's attorney. The court shall
have 30 days from the date of notice of the pending parole to exercise the
power granted under this paragraph.  If the court does not respond within that
time period, the parole will be deemed approved.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The panel established pursuant
to subsection b. of this section shall determine at the time of release the
conditions of parole, which shall be appropriately tailored to the needs of
each juvenile.  Any conditions imposed at the time of release or modified
thereafter as a graduated intervention in lieu of initiating parole revocation
proceedings shall constitute the least restrictive alternatives necessary to
promote the successful return of the juvenile to the community.  The juvenile
shall not be required to enter or complete a residential community release
program, residential treatment program, or other out-of-home placement as a
condition of parole unless it is determined that the condition is necessary to
protect the safety of the juvenile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any juvenile committed under
P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-20 et seq.) who is released on parole prior to the
expiration of the juvenile's maximum term may be retained under parole
supervision for a period not exceeding the unserved portion of the term. The
panel established pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the juvenile, the
juvenile's attorney, the juvenile's parent or guardian or, with leave of the
court any other interested party, may make a motion to the court, with notice
to the prosecuting attorney, for the return of the juvenile from a juvenile
facility prior to the juvenile's parole and provide for an alternative
disposition which would not exceed the duration of the original time to be
served in the facility.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Upon application by the
prosecutor, the court may sentence a juvenile who has been convicted of a crime
of the first, second, or third degree if committed by an adult, to an extended
term of incarceration beyond the maximum set forth in paragraph (1) of this
subsection, if it finds that the juvenile was previously adjudged delinquent on
at least two separate occasions, for offenses which, if committed by an adult,
would constitute a crime of the first or second degree. The extended term shall
not exceed five additional years for an act which would constitute murder and
shall not exceed three additional years for all other crimes of the first
degree and shall not exceed two additional years for a crime of the second
degree, if committed by an adult, and one additional year for a crime of the
third degree, if committed by an adult. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Upon application by the
prosecutor, when a juvenile is before the court at one time for disposition of
three or more unrelated offenses which, if committed by an adult, would
constitute crimes of the first, second or third degree and which are not part
of the same transaction, the court may sentence the juvenile to an extended
term of incarceration not to exceed the maximum of the permissible term for the
most serious offense for which the juvenile has been adjudicated plus two
additional years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   The panel established
pursuant to subsection b. of this section may impose a term of
post-incarceration supervision following the juvenile's release from custody
only if it is deemed necessary to effectuate the juvenile's rehabilitation and
reintegration into society.  Post-incarceration supervision shall not exceed
six months, except the term may be extended for an additional six months if the
panel established pursuant to subsection b. of this section deems continuation
of the post-incarceration supervision necessary to effectuate the juvenile's
rehabilitation and reintegration into society.  Post-incarceration supervision
shall not exceed one year.  Post-incarceration supervision shall not be imposed
on any juvenile who has completed a period of parole supervision of six months
or more.  The term of post-incarceration supervision shall commence on the date
of the expiration of the juvenile's maximum sentence.  During the term of
post-incarceration supervision the juvenile shall remain in the community and
in the legal custody of the commission.  The juvenile shall not be required to
enter or complete a residential community release program, residential
treatment program, or other out-of-home placement as a condition of
post-incarceration supervision.  A term of post-incarceration supervision
imposed pursuant to this paragraph may be terminated by the panel established
pursuant to subsection b. of this section or court if the juvenile has made a
satisfactory adjustment in the community while under supervision and if
continued supervision is not required. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The commission shall
review the case of each juvenile sentenced to a term of commitment with the
commission at least every three months and submit a status report to the court,
the prosecutor, and the counsel for the juvenile.  The commission's review and
status report shall include, but not be limited to:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   information on the
treatment, care, and custody of the juvenile; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   whether the juvenile is
receiving the mental health, substance use disorder, educational, and other
rehabilitative services necessary to promote the juvenile's successful
reintegration into the community; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   any incidents of
violence involving the juvenile; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   the juvenile's
eligibility for parole. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Counsel for the juvenile shall
have the opportunity to respond to the report required pursuant to this
paragraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission shall continue
to submit quarterly reports to the court until the juvenile is paroled or
released at the expiration of the term of incarceration and shall resume the
quarterly reviews if the juvenile is returned to the custody of the
commission.  The court may conduct a hearing at any time to determine whether
commitment with the commission continues to be appropriate pursuant to section
24 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-43) and section 25 of P.L.1982, c.77
(C.2A:4A-44), and may release the juvenile or otherwise modify the
dispositional order.  Nothing in this paragraph shall abrogate the court's
retention of jurisdiction pursuant to section 26 of P.L.1982, c.77
(C.2A:4A-45).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     If the panel
established pursuant to subsection b. of this section determines there is
probable cause to believe that the juvenile has seriously or persistently
violated the terms and conditions of parole, the commission shall conduct a
hearing to determine if the juvenile's parole should be revoked.  The juvenile
shall be represented by counsel at the hearing.  The hearing shall be conducted
by a hearing officer who is licensed as an attorney-at-law in this State.  The
juvenile shall not be incarcerated prior to the hearing unless the panel
established pursuant to subsection b. of this section determines by objective
and credible evidence that the juvenile poses an immediate and substantial
danger to public safety.  If the juvenile is incarcerated prior to the hearing,
the hearing shall be held within 72 hours of the juvenile's return to custody
and a written decision made and transmitted to the juvenile and the juvenile's
counsel within 48 hours of the hearing.  Upon request of counsel for the
juvenile, the hearing officer shall adjourn the hearing for not more than 72
hours.  Subsequent adjournments may be granted upon request of the juvenile and
good cause shown.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The panel established pursuant
to subsection b. of this section shall not revoke the parole of a juvenile
unless the hearing officer determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the juvenile has
seriously or persistently violated the conditions of parole; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the juvenile poses a
substantial danger to public safety and no form of community-based supervision
would alleviate that danger; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   revocation is consistent
with the provisions of section 2 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-21).</p>

set forth in sections 15 through 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59 through
C.30:4-123.65) shall apply to juvenile parole revocation hearings, unless the
procedures and standards conflict with those set forth in this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding a determination
that the juvenile violated a condition of parole, the panel established
pursuant to subsection b. of this section may modify those conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The panel established
pursuant to subsection b. of this section may relieve a juvenile of any parole
conditions, and may permit a parolee to reside outside the State pursuant to
the provisions of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, P.L.1955, c.55 (C.9:23-1
to 9:23-4), and after providing notice to the Attorney General, may consent to
the supervision of a parolee by the federal government pursuant to the federal
Witness Security Reform Act, Pub.L.98-473 (18 U.S.C. s.3521 et seq.). The panel

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill concerns parole for
juvenile defendants.  Under the provisions of this bill, a juvenile is required
to be represented by the Office of the Public Defender at all parole
proceedings, unless the juvenile chooses to be represented by pro bono counsel
or retains private counsel at the juveniles expense.  If the juvenile is
represented by pro bono counsel, the counsel representing the juvenile is
required to have experience in juvenile justice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the panel,
who is comprised of at least two members of the Juvenile Justice Commission and
a member of the State Parole Board, is responsible for considering the juveniles
eligibility for release from incarceration.  Current law also requires the
member of the State Parole Board to have experience in juvenile justice or
successfully complete a juvenile justice training program.  This bill removes
the option for the member of the State Parole Board to have experience in
juvenile justice and requires all members of the panel to complete a juvenile
justice training.  The bill requires the juvenile justice training to include current
research regarding the age-crime curve, which demonstrates that criminal
offending occurs in a bell curve and aging out of crime, which demonstrates the
low rate of reoffending as a person grows older.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, current law provides
that a juvenile is to be granted early release on parole when it appears that
the juvenile has made substantial progress toward positive behavioral
adjustment and rehabilitative goals articulated by the panel.  Under the bill,
in<u> </u>making the determination of whether the juvenile is to be granted
early release on parole, the panel also is required to consider any additional
evidence of maturity or rehabilitation presented by the juvenile or the
juveniles counsel and take into consideration the information provided during
the training required under the bill regarding the age-crime curve and aging
out of crime. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, under the bill,
in every case where the court waives jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency
case and the juvenile defendant is tried as an adult and receives a sentence of
incarceration, the defendant is required to be represented by the Office of the
Public Defender at all parole proceedings, unless the defendant chooses to be
represented by pro bono counsel or retains private counsel at the defendants
expense.  If the defendant is represented by pro bono counsel, the counsel
representing the defendant is required to have experience in juvenile justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires every
member of the Parole Board who serves on a board panel that is considering the
eligibility for release of a defendant whose juvenile delinquency case was
waived to adult court, who was tried as an adult, and who received a sentence
of incarceration to successfully complete the juvenile justice training program,
which includes research regarding the age-crime curve and aging out of crime. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that in addition to any other considerations sets forth under current law,
rule, or regulation, at the parole hearing of the defendant, the State Parole
Board is required to consider any evidence of maturity or rehabilitation
presented by the defendant or the defendants counsel and take into
consideration the information provided during the training required under the
bill regarding the age-crime curve and aging out of crime.</p>
