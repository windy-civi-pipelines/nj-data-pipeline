(New section) a.  Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated any provision of this act, any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or has knowingly made a false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this act, the commissioner may: (1)   issue an order, in accordance with subsection b. of this section, requiring the violator to comply with the provisions of this act, the rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the stewardship plan approved thereunder, as the case may be; (2)   bring a civil action in accordance with subsection c. of this section; (3)   levy a civil administrative penalty in accordance with subsection d. of this section; (4)   bring an action for a civil penalty in accordance with subsection e. of this section; or (5) notify the public of a producer that is not in compliance with the requirements of this act. Pursuit of any of the remedies specified under this section shall not preclude the seeking of any other remedy specified. b.    Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated this act, any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, the commissioner may issue an administrative enforcement order to the person:  specifying the provision or provisions that the person has violated; citing the action that constituted the violation; requiring the persons compliance with the provision violated; and giving notice of the person's right to a hearing on the matters contained in the administrative enforcement order.  The person subject to the order shall have 20 calendar days from receipt of the order within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing, and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order.  If no hearing is requested, the order shall become final after the expiration of the 20-day period.  A request for hearing shall not automatically stay the effect of the order. c.     The commissioner shall be authorized to institute a civil action in Superior Court for appropriate relief from any violation of the provisions of this act, or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or of a stewardship plan approved thereunder.  Such relief may include, singly or in combination: (1)   a temporary or permanent injunction; (2)   recovery of the reasonable costs of any investigation or inspection that led to the discovery of the violation, and for the recovery of the reasonable costs of preparing and bringing a civil action commenced under this subsection; (3)   recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the State in removing, correcting, or terminating the adverse effects resulting from the violation for which a civil action has been commenced and brought under this subsection; (4)   recovery of compensatory damages caused by a violation for which a civil action has been commenced and brought under this subsection.  Assessments under this subsection shall be paid to the State Treasurer, except that compensatory damages may be paid by specific order of the court to any persons who have been aggrieved by the violation. d.    (1)  The commissioner shall be authorized to assess a civil administrative penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $10,000 for each violation, provided that each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  In assessing a civil administrative penalty, the commissioner shall consider the severity of the violation, the measures taken to prevent further violations, and whether the penalty will act as an appropriate deterrent. (2)   Prior to the assessment of a civil administrative penalty under this subsection, the person committing the violation shall be notified by certified mail or personal service that the penalty is being assessed.  The notice shall identify the section of the statute, rule, regulation, or order, or the provision of the stewardship plan, that was violated; recite the facts alleged to constitute a violation; state the basis for the amount of the civil administrative penalties to be assessed; and affirm the rights of the alleged violator to a hearing.  The ordered party shall have 35 days from receipt of the notice within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine specified in the notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a final order after the expiration of the 35-day period.  Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order. (3)   The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement provisions in this act, and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this section in an amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate. e.     A person who violates any provision of this act, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or the provisions of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection b. of this section, or a court order issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or who fails to pay a civil administrative penalty in full pursuant to subsection d. of this section, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement on any application, record, report, or other document required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day of the violation, and each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected with costs in a summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), or may be collected in a civil action commenced by the commissioner.  In addition to any penalties, costs, or interest charges, the Superior Court, or the municipal court as the case may be, may assess against the violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the violation. f.     All penalties collected by the department pursuant to this act shall be deposited into the to the "Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund" established pursuant to section 8 of this act, and appropriated annually for the continued administration and enforcement of this act. 12.  (New section) a.  Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, an action undertaken by a producer or group of producers, which affects the types or quantities of packaging products being recycled or the cost or structure of any collection or recycling program, shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of any State law relating to antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair trade practices, or the regulation of trade or commerce, so long as the action is necessary to plan for or implement the organized collection or recycling of packaging products pursuant to this act. b.    The provisions of subsection a. of this section shall not apply to: (1)   any agreement establishing or affecting the price of a product; or (2)   any agreement restricting the output or production of a product or the geographic area or customers to which a product will be sold. 13.  (New section) A packaging product shall be exempt from the requirements of this act if it: a.  contains drugs, dietary supplements, medical devices, or cosmetics as those terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. s.301 et seq.; b.  contains toxic or hazardous products regulated under the "Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act," 7 U.S.C. s.136 et seq.; or c.  is manufactured for use in the shipment of hazardous materials and is: (a) prohibited from being manufactured with used material by federal packaging material specifications set forth in 49 C.F.R. s.178.509 and 49 C.F.R. s.178.522, (b) is subject to the testing standards set forth in 49 C.F.R. s.178.600 through 49 C.F.R. s.178.609, or (c) is subject to the recommendations of the United Nations on the transport of dangerous goods. 14.  (New section) a.  A small producer shall be exempt from the provisions of this act. b.  The department may, as part of the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to section 17 of this act, establish additional exemptions for producers that do not exceed a minimum market share of packaging products sold in or into the State. 15.  (New section) a.  There is established in the Department of Environmental Protection an Office of Plastics and Packaging Management.  The office shall oversee the administration and enforcement of this act, P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.), P.L.2021, c.391 (C.13:1E-99.135 et seq.), and any other law dealing with pollution from plastic and other packaging, and the deleterious environmental effects of the manufacture thereof, as determined by the commissioner. b.  (1) The office shall include an Inspector General, who shall have at least five years of experience in the enforcement of civil environmental laws or criminal law. The Inspector General shall be appointed by the commissioner, shall receive such salary as shall be provided by law, and shall devote their entire time and attention to the duties of the office.

The Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 18.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This committee substitute would require certain manufacturers and distributors of products that utilize packaging to adopt and implement plans to decrease the amount of packaging that is disposed of as solid waste, and to pay an annual surcharge to the State, the proceeds of which would be used to improve the State's recycling system.  The bill would also establish a new Office of Plastics and Packaging Management in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to oversee the administration and enforcement of laws dealing with pollution from plastic and other packaging. The bill would require the DEP, within one year after the bill's enactment, to conduct a needs assessment of the State's solid waste and recycling system.  The needs assessment would be required to include, among other things, an estimate of the costs of solid waste and recycling infrastructure upgrades that are necessary for the State to meet the recycling rate targets for packaging products established in section 5 of the bill.  The bill would require the DEP to update the needs assessment every five years. The bill would authorize producers covered under the bill to collaborate in meeting the bill's requirements by forming producer responsibility organizations (PROs).  The DEP would be authorized to approve up to 10 PROs.  A PRO would be authorized to submit a single packaging product stewardship plan that covers all producers that are members of the PRO, and to take other actions to facilitate producers' compliance with the bill's provisions.  The bill would also authorize producers to comply with the bill's provisions individually, if they so choose. Section 5 of the bill would establish certain requirements concerning the sale and composition of packaging products.  First, it would require that, by 2032, the cumulative amount of single-use packaging products sold, offered for sale, imported, or distributed in or into the State be reduced by 25 percent in volume.  At least 10 percent of this reduction would be required to be achieved by shifting to reusable products or by eliminating plastic components.  Second, it would require that, by 2034, all packaging products be either compostable or recyclable.  Third, it would require that, by 2036, the recycling rate of packaging products in the State be at least 65 percent. The bill would require each PRO, no later than 5 years after the bill's enactment, to develop and implement a packaging product stewardship plan (plan).  Each PRO would be required to first submit a draft of its plan to the Advisory Council on Solid Waste Management, established pursuant to the "Solid Waste Management Act," P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), for review and comment.  The PRO would then be required to submit its plan to the DEP for approval.  The bill would establish various requirements for the content of a plan, including that it identify the strategies that will be used by participating producers to reduce, through product design modifications and program innovation, the amount of material that is used for each packaging product and the amount of waste resulting from the use of each packaging product.  The plan would also be required to include a detailed budget, which would be required to be evaluated by an independent financial auditor to ensure that it is sufficient to costs of implementing the plan.  The PRO would raise money to fund the implementation of the plan by imposing fees on its members.  The fees would be proportional to the amount of packaging produced by the member, as well as the environmental impact of the packaging. The bill would also establish the "Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund" in the Department of the Treasury.  Moneys in the fund would be used to (1) fund efforts to improve the State's recycling system, as identified in the Statewide needs assessment, in the form of grants or low-interest loans issued by the DEP, or (2) to administer and enforce the provisions of the bill.  Each PRO (and any producers not participating in a PRO) would be assessed an annual surcharge by the Division of Taxation in the Treasury, and the moneys from the surcharge would be placed in the "Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund."  The total Statewide surcharge would be the amount needed during the following fiscal year to administer and enforce the bill's provisions and improve the State's recycling system in order to meet the recycling rate and other targets established by section 5 of the bill, as determined by the Statewide needs assessment, up to a maximum of $120 million.  The amount owed by each PRO or non-participating producer would be a prorated share of this total amount. PROs and non-participating producers would be required by the bill to engage in public outreach, to address public questions and concerns, and to provide consumers with educational and informational materials related to the stewardship plan and the services that are available thereunder.  PROs and non-participating producers would also be authorized to provide educational and informational materials to retailers regarding the implementation of the stewardship plan. The bill would establish an Office of Plastics and Packaging Management (office) in the DEP.  The purpose of the office would be to oversee the administration and enforcement of this bill, P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.), P.L.2021, c.391 (C.13:1E-99.135 et seq.), and any other law dealing with pollution from plastic and other packaging.  The office would include an Inspector General, who would, among other things, act as a liaison between the DEP, the Department of Law and Public Safety, county prosecutor's offices, and other local governments, regarding the enforcement of laws under the purview of the office. The bill would amend existing law to add several duties regarding the implementation of the bill's provisions to the duties of the Advisory Council on Solid Waste Management (council), including a duty to review packaging product stewardship plans submitted by PROs and non-participating producers.  The bill would also require certain existing recommendations from the council to be provided to the DEP commissioner at least every five years, rather than "from time to time," as stated in current law. Finally, the bill would establish various civil and administrative penalties for persons who violate the provisions of the bill, any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto, any stewardship plan approved thereunder, or any order issued by the DEP commissioner in enforcing the bill.

The Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 18.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This committee substitute would require certain manufacturers and distributors of products that utilize packaging to adopt and implement plans to decrease the amount of packaging that is disposed of as solid waste, and to pay an annual surcharge to the State, the proceeds of which would be used to improve the State's recycling system.  The bill would also establish a new Office of Plastics and Packaging Management in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to oversee the administration and enforcement of laws dealing with pollution from plastic and other packaging. The bill would require the DEP, within one year after the bill's enactment, to conduct a needs assessment of the State's solid waste and recycling system.  The needs assessment would be required to include, among other things, an estimate of the costs of solid waste and recycling infrastructure upgrades that are necessary for the State to meet the recycling rate targets for packaging products established in section 5 of the bill.  The bill would require the DEP to update the needs assessment every five years. The bill would authorize producers covered under the bill to collaborate in meeting the bill's requirements by forming producer responsibility organizations (PROs).  The DEP would be authorized to approve up to 10 PROs.  A PRO would be authorized to submit a single packaging product stewardship plan that covers all producers that are members of the PRO, and to take other actions to facilitate producers' compliance with the bill's provisions.  The bill would also authorize producers to comply with the bill's provisions individually, if they so choose. Section 5 of the bill would establish certain requirements concerning the sale and composition of packaging products.  First, it would require that, by 2032, the cumulative amount of single-use packaging products sold, offered for sale, imported, or distributed in or into the State be reduced by 25 percent in volume.  At least 10 percent of this reduction would be required to be achieved by shifting to reusable products or by eliminating plastic components.  Second, it would require that, by 2034, all packaging products be either compostable or recyclable.  Third, it would require that, by 2036, the recycling rate of packaging products in the State be at least 65 percent. The bill would require each PRO, no later than 5 years after the bill's enactment, to develop and implement a packaging product stewardship plan (plan).  Each PRO would be required to first submit a draft of its plan to the Advisory Council on Solid Waste Management, established pursuant to the "Solid Waste Management Act," P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), for review and comment.  The PRO would then be required to submit its plan to the DEP for approval.  The bill would establish various requirements for the content of a plan, including that it identify the strategies that will be used by participating producers to reduce, through product design modifications and program innovation, the amount of material that is used for each packaging product and the amount of waste resulting from the use of each packaging product.  The plan would also be required to include a detailed budget, which would be required to be evaluated by an independent financial auditor to ensure that it is sufficient to costs of implementing the plan.  The PRO would raise money to fund the implementation of the plan by imposing fees on its members.  The fees would be proportional to the amount of packaging produced by the member, as well as the environmental impact of the packaging. The bill would also establish the "Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund" in the Department of the Treasury.  Moneys in the fund would be used to (1) fund efforts to improve the State's recycling system, as identified in the Statewide needs assessment, in the form of grants or low-interest loans issued by the DEP, or (2) to administer and enforce the provisions of the bill.  Each PRO (and any producers not participating in a PRO) would be assessed an annual surcharge by the Division of Taxation in the Treasury, and the moneys from the surcharge would be placed in the "Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund."  The total Statewide surcharge would be the amount needed during the following fiscal year to administer and enforce the bill's provisions and improve the State's recycling system in order to meet the recycling rate and other targets established by section 5 of the bill, as determined by the Statewide needs assessment, up to a maximum of $120 million.  The amount owed by each PRO or non-participating producer would be a prorated share of this total amount. PROs and non-participating producers would be required by the bill to engage in public outreach, to address public questions and concerns, and to provide consumers with educational and informational materials related to the stewardship plan and the services that are available thereunder.  PROs and non-participating producers would also be authorized to provide educational and informational materials to retailers regarding the implementation of the stewardship plan. The bill would establish an Office of Plastics and Packaging Management (office) in the DEP.  The purpose of the office would be to oversee the administration and enforcement of this bill, P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.), P.L.2021, c.391 (C.13:1E-99.135 et seq.), and any other law dealing with pollution from plastic and other packaging.  The office would include an Inspector General, who would, among other things, act as a liaison between the DEP, the Department of Law and Public Safety, county prosecutor's offices, and other local governments, regarding the enforcement of laws under the purview of the office. The bill would amend existing law to add several duties regarding the implementation of the bill's provisions to the duties of the Advisory Council on Solid Waste Management (council), including a duty to review packaging product stewardship plans submitted by PROs and non-participating producers.  The bill would also require certain existing recommendations from the council to be provided to the DEP commissioner at least every five years, rather than "from time to time," as stated in current law. Finally, the bill would establish various civil and administrative penalties for persons who violate the provisions of the bill, any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto, any stewardship plan approved thereunder, or any order issued by the DEP commissioner in enforcing the bill.
