SJR106 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION No. 106 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED APRIL 15, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  NILSA I. CRUZ-PEREZ District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) SYNOPSIS Establishes New Jersey Domestic Violence and Legal Access Task Force. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution establishing the New Jersey Domestic Violence and Legal Access Task Force. Whereas, Every day, indigent pro se parties enter New Jersey courts seeking relief from abuse.  Often these people are unable to advocate effectively for themselves or articulate a sufficient basis to support the relief they are seeking from the court.  Similarly, other indigent parties must defend themselves against allegations of domestic violence.  In both instances, these litigants are often ill-equipped to articulate the merits of their positions to the court because of a language barrier, lack of understanding of the statutory standard, or for some other reason; and Whereas, Survivors of domestic violence rate the filing of an application for a restraining order as one of their most effective tools to stopping domestic violence, second only to leaving the abuser.  Studies confirm that access to counsel in restraining order proceedings can make a substantial difference in the outcome; and Whereas, Studies indicate that victims are far more likely obtain a restraining order when represented by an attorney; according to one study, approximately 80 percent of victims represented by an attorney successfully obtained a restraining order, as compared to approximately just 30 percent of victims without an attorney; and Whereas, Increasing a victims chance for obtaining a restraining order is one of the most straightforward ways in which legal assistance can reduce domestic violence.  Cases involving domestic violence are often difficult and complex, and survivors without proper legal representation are frequently further victimized by unfavorable outcomes; and Whereas, New Jersey has long recognized a right to counsel for impoverished defendants facing consequences of magnitude, even in civil cases, such as loss of motor vehicle privileges or a substantial fine in municipal court, child support enforcement proceedings, involuntary commitment proceedings, Megans Law tier classification hearings, proceedings regarding abuse, neglect or termination of all parental rights, and loss of liberty, such as the ability to own weapons or to move freely; and Whereas, Inexplicably, a defendant who is prosecuted for an act of domestic violence is not entitled to counsel even though facing a host of consequences of magnitude, which may include immediate loss of the right to occupy a residence without any relief from financial obligations related to that residence; monetary payments and penalties; seizure of firearms and the loss of the right to possess same; and suspension of the right to see his or her children; and Whereas, There is no principled reason why an indigent facing loss of motor vehicle privileges or a substantial fine in municipal court would be conferred the right to counsel, but an indigent involved in a domestic violence matter would not have a similar right; and Whereas, Domestic violence proceedings implicate fundamental rights, effect consequences of sizable magnitude, and the provision of counsel protects a core constitutional provision-the guarantee of fundamentally fair adversarial proceedings.  Absent such a safeguard, domestic violence litigants are left impermissibly vulnerable; and Whereas, By expanding the right to counsel to include both sides in a domestic violence restraining order action, this State can ensure that indigent litigants will not suffer consequences of magnitude without first receiving the protection of counsel; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.   There is established the New Jersey Domestic Violence and Legal Access Task Force to study the nature, extent and consequences of unmet legal needs of State residents in domestic violence matters. b.    The purpose of the task force is to examine, on a Statewide basis, the impact that the lack of access to legal counsel in domestic violence matters is having on the ability of State residents to be protected from physical and emotional harm, and the impact on other residents who have to defend themselves against allegations of domestic abuse. 2.    a.   The task force shall be comprised of 16 members, as follows: (1)   Two public members appointed by the Governor, one of whom shall be a representative of a pro bono program organized by a law firm located in the State, and one of whom shall be a State resident who has been a pro se litigant who has appeared as a plaintiff in a domestic violence matter in the New Jersey State courts;

(2) institute a review of New Jerseys Rules of Professional Conduct and Unauthorized Practice of Law rules with the purpose of identifying revisions that expand the ability of law students to provide pro bono assistance to persons of limited means; and (3) encourage increased pro bono service by the States legal community. 8.    The task force shall dissolve three months after presenting the report. 9.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately.
