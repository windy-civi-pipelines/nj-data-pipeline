As used in this act, "nonpublic school" means an elementary or secondary school within the State, other than a public school, offering education in grades K-12 or any combination thereof, wherein a child may legally fulfill compulsory school attendance requirements. "Charter school" means a school established pursuant to P.L.1995, c.426 (C.18A:36A-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.1998, c.31, s.1) 4.    Section 3 of P.L.1989, c.229 (C.18A:6-4.15) is amended to read as follows: 3.    The commissioner shall apply the same requirements, procedures and standards and shall proceed in the same manner as is prescribed in P.L.1986, c.116 (C.18A:6-7.1 et seq.) for determining whether the applicant would be qualified or disqualified for employment in the public schools and shall inform the applicant of his determination in writing. The commissioner shall also provide written notification to the chief administrator of the nonpublic school, which requires the criminal history record check as a condition of employment, of his determination as to whether the candidate would be qualified or disqualified for employment in the public schools. Following qualification for employment pursuant to this section, the State Bureau of Identification shall immediately forward to the Commissioner of Education any information which the bureau receives on a charge pending against an employee of the nonpublic school which requires a criminal history record check as a condition of employment. If the charge is for one of the crimes or offenses enumerated in section 1 of P.L.1986, c.116 (C.18A:6-7.1), the commissioner shall notify the chief administrator of the nonpublic school and the employee shall be suspended until the charge has been adjudicated.  In the event the employee is deemed guilty of one of the crimes and offenses enumerated in section 1 of P.L.1986, c.116 (C.18A:6-7.1) the employee shall be terminated from employment. (cf: P.L.2002, c.119, s.2) 5.    Section 1 of P.L.1986, c.116 (C.18A:6-7.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    A facility, center, school, or school system under the supervision of the Department of Education and board of education which cares for, or is involved in the education of children under the age of 18 shall not employ for pay or contract for the paid services of any teaching staff member or substitute teacher, teacher aide, child study team member, school physician, school nurse, custodian, school maintenance worker, cafeteria worker, school law enforcement officer, school secretary or clerical worker or any other person serving in a position which involves regular contact with pupils unless the employer has first determined consistent with the requirements and standards of this act, that no criminal history record information exists on file in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Identification Division, or the State Bureau of Identification which would disqualify that individual from being employed or utilized in such capacity or position.  This determination shall be made for persons employed or under contract as school bus drivers or school bus aides at the commencement of employment and the determination shall be reviewed every four years thereafter to determine a school bus drivers or school bus aides eligibility for continued employment, except that the determination of eligibility for continued employment for a person employed or under contract as a school bus driver may be fulfilled through certification that the school bus driver has undergone a criminal history record check as part of the application for renewal of a school bus drivers license.  An individual employed by a board of education or a school bus contractor holding a contract with a board of education, in the capacity of a school bus driver, shall be required to meet the criminal history record requirements pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1989, c.104 (C.18A:39-19.1).  A facility, center, school, or school system under the supervision of the Department of Education and board of education which cares for, or is involved in the education of children under the age of 18 may require criminal history record checks for individuals who, on an unpaid voluntary basis, provide services that involve regular contact with pupils.  In the case of school districts involved in a sending-receiving relationship, the decision to require criminal history record checks for volunteers shall be made jointly by the boards of education of the sending and receiving districts.

An individual, except as provided in subsection g. of this section, shall be temporarily suspended from employment or service under this section if the Commissioner of Education receives data in accordance with section 13 of P.L.1998, c.31 (C.18A:6-7.2a) on charges pending against an employee who has previously undergone a criminal history record check until the charge has been adjudicated.  If the employee is deemed guilty of one of the crimes or offenses enumerated in this section, the employee shall be terminated from employment. (cf: P.L.2011, c.72, s.9) 6.    (New section) The results of any criminal history background check conducted for a school bus driver or a school bus aide pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1989, c.229 (C.18A:6-4.13) or section 1 of P.L.1986, c.116 (C.18A:6-7.1) shall be forwarded to the county superintendent of the county in which the school bus driver or school bus aide would be employed. 7.    (New section)  Each school district that has cameras which record images on school buses shall appoint an employee to randomly view  such recorded images during each school year. 8.    This act will take effect on the first day of the third month after enactment. STATEMENT This bill would establish the School Bus Safety and Child Protection Act, requiring criminal history record checks for certain school employees and prohibiting interference with school bus monitoring devices. The bill would make it a crime of the fourth degree to purposely alter, destroy, conceal or disable a monitoring device, including a camera or other medium used to record sound or images that is installed in a school bus.  A fourth degree crime is punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000 or both. The bill would also clarify that any school bus aide in the public and charter school systems, and any school that receives public funds for school buses is required to have a criminal history record check. Prospective aides and school bus drivers would also submit to a criminal history record check prior to starting employment and every four years thereafter in these schools.  However, the bill provides that a person employed or under contract as a school bus driver may meet the bills requirement to have a criminal history check every four years by certifying that the individual has undergone a criminal history record check as part of the application for renewal of a school bus drivers license. The bill also permits nonpublic schools to conduct similar criminal history record checks to those performed by public schools, charter schools, and schools that receive governmental funding for school buses. The bill would also require that the results of the criminal history record check be sent to the county superintendent of the county in which a bus driver or school bus aide would be employed. This bill would require that an employee who commits a disqualifying offense be suspended until the offense is adjudicated, and a conviction or other adverse adjudication would result in termination of the employees service. The bill also requires each school district that has cameras which record images on school buses to appoint an employee to randomly view such recorded images during each school year.
