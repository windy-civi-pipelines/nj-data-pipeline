The bill would empower the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) to subject a municipal development program to EDA review and supervision if a municipal officer or program official is convicted of, or indicted or charged for, a crime or offense involving public corruption under federal or State law. The bill requires EDA to develop and promulgate rules and regulations to implement the provisions of the bill.  Under the bill, the rules and regulations are required to: establish a reporting system through which the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, the Division of Criminal Justice in the Department of Law and Public Safety, and each county prosecutor would annually be requested to notify EDA of an applicable charge, indictment, or conviction; provide for the selection and appointment of economic and community development monitors to oversee applicable municipal development programs; establish criteria governing the length and terms of EDA review, supervision, and control over a municipal development program.  The bill specifies that: if EDA is notified of a single applicable conviction, indictment, or charge pertaining to a municipality, EDA may appoint an economic and community development monitor to oversee that municipalitys municipal development programs for a period of three years from the date of the last conviction, indictment, or charge; and if EDA is notified of three or more applicable convictions, indictments, or charges pertaining to a municipality within a three-year period, EDA is required to immediately appoint an economic and community development monitor to oversee that municipalitys municipal development programs for a period of three years from the date of the last conviction, indictment, or charge.
