STATEMENT This bill provides for an approved agency, which is an agency approved by the Department of Children and Families (DCF) to place children for adoption in New Jersey, to facilitate the voluntary temporary placement of an infant, child, parent under 21 years of age with an infant, or pregnant woman under 21 years of age in the home of a volunteer, who is to provide a temporary home during the time that the parent of the infant or child or the pregnant woman is in crisis.  "Crisis" is defined in the bill as a temporary situation which includes, but is not limited to, homelessness, hospitalization, substance abuse or mental health issues, domestic violence, unemployment, any situation which would leave a child or infant with no parent or guardian available to care for the child or infant, or any situation which would leave a pregnant woman under 21 years of age with no safe home to reside in during pregnancy as determined by an approved agency.  An approved agency is to enter into a contract with DCF prior to facilitating the placements. These agencies are also to: provide oversight of a placement by visiting the home weekly; provide assistance to help guide the parent or pregnant woman in restoring a stable life; and locate a different voluntary temporary placement if, as determined by the approved agency, a change is necessary. A home study to determine the suitability of the home is to be conducted prior to a prospective volunteer providing the temporary home.  As part of the home study, the approved agency is to consider background checks from the State's child abuse registry and obtain State and federal criminal history record checks for each prospective volunteer and person 18 years of age or older residing in the prospective volunteer's home.  The costs of the checks are to be paid by the prospective volunteer and person 18 years of age or older. The bill also provides that the approved agency is to forward each home study and the agency's determination of the suitability of the home to DCF, prior to placement of a person in crisis in the home of a prospective volunteer.  The approved agency is to maintain a record of each home study, background check, and its determination of the suitability of the home. The bill also amends the law governing confidentiality of information in the State's child abuse registry to permit disclosure of the information to a prospective volunteer seeking to provide a temporary home under the bill and a person 18 years of age or older residing in the home.
