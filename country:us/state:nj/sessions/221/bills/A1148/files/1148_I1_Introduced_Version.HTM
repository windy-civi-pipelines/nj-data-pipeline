voluntary temporary placement of an infant, child, parent under 21 years of age

is defined in the bill as a temporary situation which includes, but is not
limited to, homelessness, hospitalization, substance abuse or mental health
issues, domestic violence, unemployment, any situation which would leave a
child or infant with no parent or guardian available to care for the child or
infant, or any situation which would leave a pregnant woman under 21 years of
age with no safe home to reside in during pregnancy as determined by an
approved agency.  An approved agency is to enter into a contract with DCF prior
to facilitating the placements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     These agencies are also to:
provide oversight of a placement by visiting the home weekly; provide
assistance to help guide the parent or pregnant woman in restoring a stable
life; and locate a different voluntary temporary placement if, as determined by
the approved agency, a change is necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A home study to determine the
suitability of the home is to be conducted prior to a prospective volunteer
providing the temporary home.  As part of the home study, the approved agency
is to consider background checks from the State's child abuse registry and
obtain State and federal criminal history record checks for each prospective
volunteer and person 18 years of age or older residing in the prospective
volunteer's home.  The costs of the checks are to be paid by the prospective
volunteer and person 18 years of age or older.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
the approved agency is to forward each home study and the agency's
determination of the suitability of the home to DCF, prior to placement of a
person in crisis in the home of a prospective volunteer.  The approved agency
is to maintain a record of each home study, background check, and its determination
of the suitability of the home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends the law
governing confidentiality of information in the State's child abuse registry to
permit disclosure of the information to a prospective volunteer seeking to
provide a temporary home under the bill and a person 18 years of age or older
residing in the home.     </p>
