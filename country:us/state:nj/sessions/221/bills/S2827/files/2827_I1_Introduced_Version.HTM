class=HangingAnActChar> concerning greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas
and supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  The act shall be known and
may be cited as the &quot;Emission Reduction Innovation Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Biogas&quot; means gas
created by the anaerobic digestion of biomass, the gasification of biomass, or
any other effective conversion process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Board&quot; means the
Board of Public Utilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Carbon capture and
utilization&quot; means processes to capture greenhouse gases that would
otherwise be released into the atmosphere and the use of those gases, or
process byproducts, to create industrial or commercial products for sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Carbon-free
resource&quot; means an electricity generation facility that, when operating,
does not contribute to Statewide greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Cost recovery mechanism&quot;
means the process by which a gas public utility seeks to recover the costs of
implementing a utility innovation plan pursuant to this act, including the cost
of capital established by the Board of Public Utilities in the gas public
utilitys most recent rate case, depreciation and other operating, maintenance,
research, and development costs.  &quot;Cost recovery mechanism&quot; includes,
but is not limited to, existing cost recovery mechanisms administered by the
Board of Public Utilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Deep energy
retrofit&quot; means the installation of any measure or combination of
measures, including air sealing and addressing thermal bridges that under
normal weather and operating conditions can reasonably be expected to reduce the
building's calculated design load to ten or fewer British Thermal Units per
hour per square foot of conditioned floor area.  &quot;Deep energy retrofit&quot;
does not include the installation of photovoltaic electric generation
equipment, but may include the installation of a solar thermal project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;District energy&quot;
means an interconnected infrastructure network for heating and cooling that
uses the constant temperature of the earth or underground aquifers as a thermal
exchange medium to provide thermal energy or cooling to a dedicated subset of
buildings that may vary in use, size, and number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Gas public utility&quot;
means a public utility, as that term is defined in R.S.48:2-13, that
distributes natural gas to end users within this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Greenhouse gas&quot;
means the same as the term is defined in section 3 of P.L.2007, c.112
(C.26:2C-39).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Hybrid energy
system&quot; means the installation of a system for the combined use of
electric and gas end-use equipment in a building application where the
installation (1) will result in a net reduction in Statewide greenhouse gas
emissions over the life of the equipment, inclusive of the consideration of the
carbon intensity of the electricity used and calculated in a manner consistent
with the Department of Environmental Protection's current methodology for
measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions, as compared to the most
efficient commercially available natural gas alternative, and (2) is installed
and operated in a manner that improves the customer's electric public utility's
load factor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Innovative
resource&quot; means the use of biogas, renewable natural gas,
power-to-hydrogen, power-to-ammonia, carbon capture and utilization, or the
deployment of a hybrid energy system, microgrid, on-site generation, district
energy, or energy efficiency project, or any other emerging innovative resource
proposed by a gas public utility that reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas
emissions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Lifecycle greenhouse gas
emissions&quot; means the greenhouse gas emissions of an energy generation
system, considering the emissions produced by the production, processing,
transmission, and consumption of energy associated with the system over its
entire useful life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Microgrid&quot; means an
interconnected infrastructure network for energy delivery that distributes
energy to a dedicated subset of buildings that may vary in use, size, and
number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;On-site generation&quot;
means the use of equipment that generates necessary energy for a customer at
their premises, including, but not limited to, combined heat and power, micro
combined heat and power, fuel cells, and backup generators that displace source
emissions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Power-to-ammonia&quot;
means the creation of ammonia from hydrogen created via power-to-hydrogen using
a process that has lower lifecycle greenhouse gas intensity than conventional
geologic natural gas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Power-to-hydrogen&quot;
means the use of electricity generated by a carbon-free resource to create
hydrogen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Renewable energy
certificate&quot; or &quot;REC&quot; means a certificate representing the
environmental benefits or attributes of one megawatt-hour of electric power generation
from an electric power generation facility that produces renewable energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Renewable natural
gas&quot; means biogas that has been processed to be interchangeable with
conventional natural gas and have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas intensity than
conventional geologic natural gas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Total incremental
program cost&quot; means the sum of (1) the return of and on capital investments
for the production, processing, pipeline interconnection, storage, distribution,
or other costs associated with the development of innovative resources included
in a utility innovation plan approved pursuant to this act, (2) the incremental
operating costs associated with capital investments in infrastructure for the
production, processing, pipeline interconnection, storage, distribution, or
other costs associated with the development of innovative resources included in
a utility innovation plan approved pursuant to this act, (3) the incremental

utility upon the resale of an innovative resource or its byproducts including
any environmental credits included with the resale of renewable gaseous fuels
or value received by the gas public utility when an innovative resource is used
as vehicle fuel, (2) any cost savings achieved through avoidance of conventional
natural gas purchases, including, but not limited to, any avoided commodity
purchases or avoided pipeline costs, and (3) any other revenues received by the
utility that are directly attributable to the utility's implementation of a
utility innovation plan pursuant to this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Together with its utility
innovation plan, a gas public utility shall provide the board with a
sensitivity analysis for the forecasted total incremental program costs, cost
per metric ton of emissions abated, and lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions associated
with achieving:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) approximately half of the greenhouse

gas reduction or avoidance benefits of the utility's innovation plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The board shall approve,
approve with modifications, or deny a utility innovation plan submitted
pursuant to this section.  Modifications required by the board may include
limiting the spending or size of a particular innovative resource or pilot
project contained in the plan, due to its anticipated impact on ratepayers.  The
board shall approve an innovation plan if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the size, scope, and scale
of the plan and the incremental total cost of the plan will result in net
benefits under the cost-benefit review performed by the board pursuant to
section 4 of this act;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) the plan will promote the
use of renewable energy resources and reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions
at a cost level consistent with the provisions of section 3 of this act;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) the plan will promote
local economic development;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) the innovative resources
included in the plan have a lower lifecycle greenhouse gas intensity than conventional

in the plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7) the costs and revenues
expected to be incurred for any energy efficiency, district energy, or hybrid
energy system measures included in the plan are reasonable in comparison to the
costs of renewable natural gas, biogas, hydrogen produced via
power-to-hydrogen, or ammonia produced via power-to-ammonia resources that the
utility could deploy to address greenhouse gas emissions; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8) the total amount of
estimated greenhouse gas reduction or avoidance to be achieved is reasonable
considering the State's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals established by
the &quot;Global Warming Response Act,&quot; P.L.2007, c.112 (C.26:2C-37 et
al.), customer cost, and the total amount of greenhouse gas reduction or
avoidance achieved under the gas public utility's previously approved plans, if
applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  A gas public utility shall
bear the burden to prove that the actual total incremental program costs to
implement an approved utility innovation plan are reasonable.  Prudently
incurred costs incurred pursuant to an approved plan and prudently incurred
costs for obtaining the third-party analyses required under paragraphs (7) and
(8) of subsection a. of this section, are recoverable through the cost recovery
mechanisms described in an approved plan provided that, after notice and
comment, the board determines that the costs included for recovery through the
rate schedule are prudently incurred.  Annual adjustments shall include a rate
of return, income taxes on the rate of return, incremental property taxes,
incremental depreciation expenses, and incremental operation and maintenance
expenses.  The rate of return shall be at the level approved by the board in
the gas public utility's last base rate case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  Upon approval of a
utility's plan, the board shall establish plan cost-effectiveness objectives
based on the cost-benefit review for innovative resources established pursuant
to section 4 of this act.  The cost-effectiveness objective for each plan shall
strive to demonstrate incremental progress from the previously approved plan's
cost-effectiveness objective, if applicable.  In the event progress is not being
made, the gas public utility shall provide context regarding the circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  A gas public utility with
an approved plan may, within any 365-day period of time within the five years
of the plan's commencement, shift budgets between individual innovative
resources, in the following manner:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) up to and including 25
percent of the total plan budget may be shifted with notification to the board
and rate counsel; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) greater than 25 percent of
the total plan budget may be shifted with board approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  A gas public utility with
an approved plan shall provide annual reports to the board regarding the work
completed pursuant to the plan.  An annual report may include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the costs incurred under
the plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) lifecycle greenhouse gas
reduction or avoidance accomplished under the plan; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) a description of the
processes used to track, verify, and retire the innovative resources and
associated environmental attributes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) an update on the lifecycle
greenhouse gas accounting methodology consistent with current Department of
Environmental Protection inventory reporting methodology;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) an update on the economic impact
of the plan including job creation; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) the utility's progress
toward achieving the cost-effectiveness objectives established by the board on
approval of the plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  Each utility innovation
plan shall be in effect for five years.  Once a gas public utility has an
approved innovation plan, it may file a new innovation plan within four years
for implementation at the end of the prior five-year plan period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.  For the purposes of this act,
including the board's lifecycle carbon accounting framework and cost-benefit review
for innovative resources carried out pursuant to section 4 of this act, whenever
an analysis or estimate of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions,
lifecycle greenhouse gas avoidance, or lifecycle greenhouse gas intensity is
required, the analysis shall include a description of (1) avoided or reduced
emissions attributable to utility operations; (2) avoided or reduced emissions
from the production, processing, and transmission of fuels prior to receipt by
the utility; and (3) avoided or reduced emissions at the point of end use.  In
no event shall the analysis count any one unit of greenhouse gas emissions
avoidance or reduction more than once.  An analysis or estimate may rely on
emissions factors, default values, or engineering estimates from a publicly
accessible source, where direct measurement is not technically or economically
feasible, if such emissions factors, default values, or engineering estimates
can be demonstrated to produce a reasonable estimate of greenhouse gas
emissions reductions, avoidance, or intensity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.  Any electric end-use
equipment installed pursuant to an approved utility innovation plan shall be
the exclusive property of the owner of the property on which the equipment is
installed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  a.  In reviewing the
lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions of the innovative resources
within a utility innovation plan, the Department of Environmental Protection,
in consultation with the board, shall review the consistency of the plan with
the departments current greenhouse gas emissions inventory reporting
methodology, and the State's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals
established by the &quot;Global Warming Response Act,&quot; P.L.2007, c.112
(C.26:2C-37 et al.).  This review shall conclude no later than 180 days from
the date of a gas public utilitys filing with the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  In reviewing the cost-benefit
analytic framework of the innovative resources within a gas utilitys
innovation plan, the board shall do so in a manner consistent with the boards
existing guidelines and processes for other utility investment programs.  This
shall include consideration of any important additional economic costs and
benefits, programmatic costs and benefits, additional environmental costs and
benefits, and other costs or benefits that may be expected under a plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.  This act shall take effect
immediately.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, to be known as the
&quot;Emission Reduction Innovation Act,&quot; would authorize gas public
utilities to develop and implement &quot;utility innovation plans,&quot; which
would aim to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas
use in the State through the use of biogas, renewable natural gas, power-to-hydrogen,
power-to-ammonia, carbon capture and utilization, the deployment of a hybrid
energy, district energy, or energy efficiency project, and the use of other
innovative technologies proposed by the utility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would establish
certain content requirements for utility innovation plans, as enumerated in
subsections a. through c. of section 3 of the bill.  The plans would be
required to be submitted to the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) for approval.  Each
plan would be effective for five years, after which the utility would be
authorized to submit an updated plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require a gas
public utility to show that the costs to implement an approved utility
innovation plan are reasonable.  If approved by the board, the utility could
recover the costs of implementing the plan through the rates it charges to its
ratepayers or using another methodology.  The bill would authorize utilities to
shift up to 25 percent of the total plan budget between individual projects or
programs, after providing notice to the BPU and rate counsel.  Shifts greater
than 25 percent of the total plan budget would require BPU approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require gas
public utilities that are implementing approved utility innovation plans to
submit an annual report to the BPU on the status of the plan.  The bill would
authorize the report to include certain items including the costs incurred
under the plan and the lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction or avoidance
accomplished under the plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 4 of the bill would
require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in consultation with
the BPU, to review the methodology by which a utility innovation plan
calculates the lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions associated with the plan. 
The DEP would be required to ensure that the methodology is consistent with its
own current methodology for measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions,
as well as that the plan is consistent with the State's greenhouse gas
emissions reduction goals established by the &quot;Global Warming Response
Act,&quot; P.L.2007, c.112 (C.26:2C-37 et al.).  The DEP would have 180 days to
complete its review.  Section 4 of the bill would also require that, when the
BPU reviews the cost-benefit analytic framework of a proposed utility
innovation plan, it does so in a manner consistent with the boards existing
guidelines and processes for other utility investment programs.</p>
