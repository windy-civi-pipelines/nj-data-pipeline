The asphalt price adjustment shall be calculated in accordance with the formula and relevant instructions published in the most recent edition of the "New Jersey Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction."

Every bid specification prepared pursuant to P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.) shall be eligible for a fuel price adjustment.  Fuel that is eligible for a fuel price adjustment shall be the sum of the quantities of the eligible pay items in the contract multiplied by the fuel usage factors as determined by the department.  The types of fuel furnished shall be at the discretion of the contractor. The fuel requirement for items not determined by the department to be eligible, and for pay items in the bid specifications calling for less than 500 gallons of fuel, shall not be eligible for a fuel price adjustment.  If more than one pay item has the same nomenclature but with different thicknesses, depths, or types, each individual pay item must require 500 gallons or more of fuel to be eligible for a fuel price adjustment.

Fuel price index adjustments shall not be made in those months for which the monthly fuel price index has changed by less than five percent from the basic fuel price index. Any specification which knowingly excludes prospective bidders by reason of the impossibility of performance, bidding or qualification by any but one bidder, except as provided herein, shall be null and void and of no effect and shall be readvertised for receipt of new bids, and the original contract shall be set aside by the governing body. Any specification for a contract for the collection and disposal of municipal solid waste shall conform to the uniform bid specifications for municipal solid waste collection contracts established pursuant to section 22 of P.L.1991, c.381 (C.48:13A-7.22). Any specification for a contract for an online parking payment service shall stipulate that parking fees shall not be charged to a user of the online parking payment service during a time period when parking is prohibited or is free at a parking project.

Any prospective bidder who wishes to challenge a bid specification shall file such challenges in writing with the contracting agent no less than three business days prior to the opening of the bids.  Challenges filed after that time shall be considered void and having no impact on the contracting unit or the award of a contract.1 (cf: P.L.2015, c.201, s.1) 13. (New section)  Any contract entered into by a municipality, or a parking authority, as that term is defined in section 3 of P.L.1948, c.198 (C.40:11A-3), for an online parking payment service shall stipulate that parking fees shall not be charged to a user of the service during a time period when parking is prohibited or is free at a parking project.1 4.   This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all contracts and agreements entered into, renewed, modified, or amended on or after the date this act takes effect.

Fuel price index adjustments shall not be made in those months for which the monthly fuel price index has changed by less than five percent from the basic fuel price index. Any specification which knowingly excludes prospective bidders by reason of the impossibility of performance, bidding or qualification by any but one bidder, except as provided herein, shall be null and void and of no effect and shall be readvertised for receipt of new bids, and the original contract shall be set aside by the governing body.
