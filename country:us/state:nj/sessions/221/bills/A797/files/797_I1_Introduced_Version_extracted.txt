STATEMENT This bill limits the amount that a covered person is required to pay upfront in order to obtain oral anticancer medications by amending P.L.2011, c. 188, which requires health insurers, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Program to cover oral anticancer medications on a basis no less favorable than intravenous anticancer medications. Specifically, the bill provides that, except for any copayment, deductible or coinsurance required to be paid by the covered person pursuant to the contract or policy, a contract or policy shall not require a covered person to pay any additional upfront cost or out of pocket expense for orally administered anticancer medications, even if reimbursement for that cost or expense is to be provided to the covered person at a later date. Due to the extremely high cost of many oral anticancer medications, many patients cannot afford to pay for these medications upfront and wait for reimbursement from their insurer or health benefits plan at a later date.  This bill attempts to remedy these situations by limiting upfront costs to the patients copayment, deductible or coinsurance.

(cf: P.L.2011, c.188, s.9) 10.  Section 10 of P.L.2011, c.188 (C.52:14-17.46.6c) is amended to read as follows: 10.     a.   The School Employees' Health Benefits Commission shall ensure that every contract purchased on or after the effective date of this act that provides hospital or medical expense benefits shall provide coverage for expenses for prescribed, orally administered anticancer medications used to kill or slow the growth of cancerous cells on a basis no less favorable than the contract provides for intravenously administered or injected anticancer medications. b.    Pursuant to subsection a. of this section, coverage for expenses for prescribed, orally administered anticancer medications used to kill or slow the growth of cancerous cells shall not be subject to any prior authorization, dollar limit, copayment, deductible or coinsurance provision that does not apply to intravenously administered or injected anticancer medications. c.     A School Employees' Health Benefits Commission contract shall not achieve compliance with the provisions of this section by imposing an increase in patient cost sharing, including any copayment, deductible or coinsurance, for anticancer medications, whether intravenously administered or injected or orally administered, that are covered under the contract as of the effective date of this act. d.    Except for any copayment, deductible or coinsurance required to be paid by the covered person pursuant to the contract, a contract shall not require a covered person to pay any additional upfront cost or out of pocket expense for orally administered anticancer medications, even if reimbursement for that cost or expense is to be provided to the covered person at a later date. (cf: P.L.2011, c.188, s.10) 11.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all contracts and policies issued on or after the effective date. STATEMENT This bill limits the amount that a covered person is required to pay upfront in order to obtain oral anticancer medications by amending P.L.2011, c. 188, which requires health insurers, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Program to cover oral anticancer medications on a basis no less favorable than intravenous anticancer medications. Specifically, the bill provides that, except for any copayment, deductible or coinsurance required to be paid by the covered person pursuant to the contract or policy, a contract or policy shall not require a covered person to pay any additional upfront cost or out of pocket expense for orally administered anticancer medications, even if reimbursement for that cost or expense is to be provided to the covered person at a later date. Due to the extremely high cost of many oral anticancer medications, many patients cannot afford to pay for these medications upfront and wait for reimbursement from their insurer or health benefits plan at a later date.  This bill attempts to remedy these situations by limiting upfront costs to the patients copayment, deductible or coinsurance.
