(cf: P.L.1963, c.150, s.16) 3.    Section 1 of P.L.1996, c.71 (C.34:11-56.47) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a.  Any person who submits a bid directly to a public body for a contract for any public work subject to the provisions of the "New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act," P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) and is not awarded the contract and whose bid is the lowest bid other than the bid accepted by the public body or, if, pursuant to law, the contract is awarded on the basis of factors other than or in addition to the lowest bid, whose bid is the highest in rank other than the bid accepted by the public body (hereinafter referred to in this section as the "plaintiff") may bring an action for damages in a court of competent jurisdiction against the contractor who was directly awarded the contract by the public body or any subcontractor of that contractor (hereinafter referred to in this section as the "defendant") alleging that the defendant has, in connection with work performed pursuant to the contract, violated the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) or failed to pay any contribution, tax, assessment or benefit required by any other applicable law. If there is more than one losing bidder, a bidder with a higher bid than the second lowest bidder or lower rank than the second highest rank, if, pursuant to law, the contract is awarded on the basis of factors other than or in addition to the lowest bid, may bring the action if that bidder gives written notice of his intention to bring an action, sent by first-class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested, to every other losing bidder whose bid was lower than his or whose bid was higher in rank than his and none of the bidders notified files an action within 30 days following the date of their receipt of notice.  The written notice of intention to bring an action must contain the following: (1) a statement of the specific violations or failures to pay allegedly committed, which shall not preclude, in the course of the action, consideration of other violations or failures to pay as may be revealed in the course of discovery, (2) a statement that the action is to be filed pursuant to this act, and (3) a statement that the recipient of the notice may have the right to file an action and will be precluded from doing so if he does not file an action within 30 days of his receipt of the notice.  If no other losing bidder so notified files an action within 30 days of his receipt of the notice, the losing bidder who sent the notice shall file an action pursuant to this act within 15 days of the last day any of the recipients of the notice could have filed an action.  If more than one bidder files an action, all actions other than that filed by the bidder whose bid is the lowest of the bidders who filed actions, or, if, pursuant to law, the contract is awarded on the basis of factors other than or in addition to the lowest bid, whose bid is the highest in rank of the bidders who filed actions, shall be dismissed. b.  Upon a finding by the court that the plaintiff was a responsible bidder for the contract and a finding that one or more defendants violated the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) or failed to pay any contribution, tax, assessment or benefit required by any other applicable law in connection with work performed pursuant to the contract, and that the plaintiff submitted a bid for the contract which was less than the sum total of the bid accepted by the public body plus any additional amount that the defendant or defendants would have paid during the term of the contract to be in full compliance with P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) and other applicable laws in connection with the contract, the court shall order the defendant or defendants to pay to the plaintiff the entire amount of damages sustained plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees or, if the court finds the noncompliance to be intentional, three times the amount of damages sustained plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees, except that the court shall order no payment to the plaintiff if the court finds that the violation or failure to pay was caused by minor record keeping mistakes or minor computational errors or by other minor mistakes.  The occurrence of more than two violations or failures to pay shall lead to the rebuttable presumption that the violation or failure to pay at issue is not minor.  If there are two or more defendants, the court shall allocate the payments for damages sustained and attorney's fees among the defendants in a reasonable manner.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring payments to a plaintiff by any contractor or subcontractor who has not violated the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) or failed to pay any contribution, tax, assessment or benefit required by any other applicable law in connection with work performed pursuant to the contract.  A plaintiff may designate an agent or representative to maintain the action if the violation or failure to pay has an adverse effect on the agent or representative or, if the agent or representative is an organization or association, on any member of the organization or association.  If the plaintiff prevails, the agent or representative shall be entitled to reimbursement for costs and reasonable attorney's fees of the agent or representative but not to a financial interest in the damages awarded. c.  For the purposes of this section, the damages sustained by a plaintiff shall include the plaintiff's costs of preparing and submitting the bid and may, if sought by the plaintiff, include profits that the court determines the plaintiff would have made if the plaintiff had been awarded the contract and complied with P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) and other applicable laws. d.  If the court determines that the defendant did not, in connection with work performed pursuant to the contract, violate the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) or fail to pay any contribution, tax, assessment or benefit required by other applicable law, the court shall order the plaintiff to pay the costs and reasonable attorney's fees of the defendant.  Nothing herein shall preclude a defendant who is found to have committed minor record keeping mistakes, minor computational errors or other minor mistakes from being awarded relief pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1988, c.46 (C.2A:15-59.1). e. If a construction project is undertaken by a public institution of higher education, in which the construction project is intended for use by a public institution of higher education at the time of construction, the public body shall be subject to the requirements of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.).  If the public institution of higher education, the public body, violates the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.), the public institution of higher education will be subject to the penalties defined under P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.). f.  As used in this section: "Person" means any individual, corporation, company, partnership, firm, association or business; "Contractor" means a person who is directly awarded a contract for a public work by a public body; and "Subcontractor" means any subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor of a contractor.

(7)  The State Treasurer, in consultation with the Secretary of Higher Education, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and the New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority, as to projects to be financed through the New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority, may promulgate any rules and regulations necessary to implement this subsection, including, but not limited to, provisions for fees to cover administrative costs, and for the determination of minimum State or county college standards for the operation of the project, and for the qualification for professional services, construction contracting, and other relevant qualifications. g.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2018, c.90) h.    A project with an expenditure of under $50 million developed under a public-private partnership agreement shall include a requirement that precludes contractors from engaging in the project if the contractor has contributed to the private entity's financing of the project in an amount of more than 10% of the project's financing costs. i.     The power of eminent domain shall not be delegated to any private entity under the provisions of P.L.2018, c.90 (C.40A:11-52 et al.); however, a State or county college may dedicate any property interest, including improvements, and tangible personal property of the State or county college for public use in a qualifying project if the State or county college finds that so doing will serve the public purpose of the project by minimizing the cost of the project to the State or county college or reducing the delivery time of a project. j.     Any public-private partnership agreement, if appropriate, shall include provisions affirming that the agreement and any work performed under the agreement are subject to the provisions of the "Construction Industry Independent Contractor Act," P.L.2007, c.114 (C.34:20-1 et seq.).  Any public-private partnership agreement shall also include, at a minimum: (i) the term of the agreement; (ii) the total project cost; (iii) a completion date guarantee; (iv) a provision for damages if the private entity fails to meet the completion date; and (v) a maximum rate of return to the private entity and a provision for the distribution of excess earnings to the local government unit or to the private party for debt reduction. k. (1) A private entity seeking to enter into a public-private partnership agreement with the State or county college shall be qualified by the State or county college as part of the procurement process, provided such process ensures that the private entity meets at least the minimum State or county college standards for qualification for professional services, construction contracting, and other qualifications applicable to the project, prior to submitting a proposal under the procurement process. (2)  A request for qualifications for a public-private partnership agreement shall be advertised at least 45 days prior to the anticipated date of receipt.  The advertisement of the request for qualifications shall be published on the official Internet website of the State or county college and at least one or more newspapers with Statewide circulation. (3)  After the State or county college determines the qualified respondents utilizing, at minimum, the qualification standards promulgated by the State Treasurer, the State or county college shall issue a request for proposals to each qualified respondent no less than 90 days prior to the date established for submission of the proposals.  The request for proposals shall include relevant technical submissions, documents, and the evaluation criteria to be used in the selection of the designated respondent.  The evaluation criteria shall be, at minimum, criteria promulgated by the State Treasurer, in consultation with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. (4)  The State or county college may accept unsolicited proposals from private entities for public-private partnership agreements. If the State or county college receives an unsolicited proposal and determines that it meets the standards of this section, the State or county college shall publish a notice of the receipt of the proposal on the Internet site of the State or county college, or through at least one or more newspapers with Statewide circulation, and provide notice of the proposal at its next scheduled public meeting and to the State Treasurer. To qualify as an unsolicited proposal, the unsolicited proposal shall at a minimum include a description of the public-private project, the estimated construction and life-cycle costs, a timeline for development, proposed plan of financing, including projected revenues, public or private, debt, equity investment or availability payments, description of how the project meets needs identified in existing plans, the permits and approvals needed to develop the project from local, state and federal agencies and a projected schedule for obtaining such permits and approvals, a statement of risks, liabilities and responsibilities to be assumed by the private entity.  If a notice is published exclusively in newspapers, the notice shall appear in at least one or more newspapers with Statewide circulation where the proposed project is to be located.  The notice shall provide that the State or county college will accept, for 120 days after the initial date of publication, proposals meeting the standards of this section from other private entities for eligible projects that satisfy the same basic purpose and need. A copy of the notice shall be mailed to each municipal and county local government body in the geographic area affected by the proposal. (5)  After the proposal or proposals have been received, and any public notification period has expired, the State or county college shall rank the proposals in order of preference. In ranking the proposals, the State or county college may consider factors that include, but may not be limited to, professional qualifications, general business terms, innovative engineering, architectural services, or cost-reduction terms, finance plans, and the need for State or county college funds to deliver the project and discharge the agreement.  The private entity selected shall comply with all laws and regulations required by the State government entity, including but not limited to section 1 of P.L.2001, c.134 (C.52:32-44), sections 2 through 8 of P.L.1975, c.127 (C.10:5-32 to 38), section 1 of P.L.1977, c.33 (C.52:25-24.2), P.L.2005, c.51 (C.19:44A-20.13 et al.); P.L.2005, c.271 (C.40A:11-51 et al.), Executive Order No. 117 of 2008, Executive Order No. 118 of 2008, Executive Order No. 189, prior to executing the public-private partnership agreement.  If only one proposal is received, the State or county college shall negotiate in good faith and, if not satisfied with the results of the negotiations, the State or county college may, at its sole discretion, terminate negotiations. (6)  The State or county college may require that the private entity assume responsibility for all costs incurred by the State or county college before execution of the public-private partnership agreement, including costs of retaining independent experts to review, analyze, and advise the State or county college with respect to the proposal. (7)  Stipends may be used on public-private partnership projects when there is a substantial opportunity for innovation and the costs for developing a proposal are significant.  The State or county college may elect to pay unsuccessful proposers for the work product they submit with their proposal in response to a request for proposals.  The use by the State or county college of any design element contained in an unsuccessful proposal shall be at the sole risk and discretion of the State or county college and shall not confer liability on the recipient of the stipulated stipend amount.  After payment of the stipulated stipend amount, the State or county college and the unsuccessful proposer shall jointly own the rights to, and may make use of any work product contained in the proposal, including the technologies, techniques, methods, processes, ideas, and information contained in the proposal, project design, and project financial plan.  The use by the unsuccessful proposer of any part of the work product contained in the proposal shall be at the sole risk of the unsuccessful proposer and shall not confer liability on the State or county college. (8)  The State or county college shall set aside one percent of each project and remit it to the Public Private Partnership Review fund established pursuant to P.L.2018, c.90 (C.40A:11-52 et al.), for purposes of plan review and analysis required under the bill. (9)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as or deemed a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the State, the State or county college, or an affected locality or public entity or any officer or employee thereof with respect to the participation in or approval of all or any part of the public-private project. (cf: P.L.2018, c.90, s.5) 6.    Section 5 of P.L.2004, c.127 (C.18A:72A-5.1) is amended to read as follows: 5.    Each worker employed in the construction or rehabilitation of facilities, including if the product of the construction or rehabilitation is intended for use by a public institution of higher education, undertaken in connection with loans, loan guarantees, expenditures, investments, tax exemptions or other incentives or financial assistance approved, provided, authorized, facilitated or administered by the New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority, or undertaken to fulfill any condition of receiving any of the incentives or financial assistance, shall be paid not less than the prevailing wage rate for the worker's craft or trade, as determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.). The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development shall determine the prevailing wage rate in the locality in which the construction or rehabilitation is to be performed for each craft, trade or classification of worker employed in the construction or rehabilitation, as if the construction or rehabilitation is "public work" as defined in section 2 of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.26). (cf: P.L.2004, c.127, s.5) 7.    (New Section)  A public institution of higher education shall pay not less than the prevailing wage rate for any construction completed by the selected bidder, pursuant to P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.).  Nothing in this act shall be construed as restricting or limiting any right established or provided to employees by any other law.  If any section, subsection, clause, sentence, paragraph, or part of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, shall, for any reason, be adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate any other right or obligation to pay prevailing wage. 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides that a public institution of higher education is required to pay the State prevailing wage rate determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development when a development is intended for use by the institution at the time of construction.  The bill requires the prevailing wage rate to be paid for work under a contract with a for-profit or not-for-profit entity associated with the public body when the purpose of the entity is raising or managing public or private financial support or managing assets on behalf of the public body, where the construction, reconstruction, demolition, alteration, custom fabrication, repair work, or maintenance work undertaken under contract with the entity is to be used by or for the benefit of the public body. The bill adds to the definition of public work subject to prevailing wage requirements work on properties or premises under agreement to be purchased by the public body and work paid for in whole or in part by take-out financing. The bill provides that public work is also defined to mean work on a project receiving financial assistance provided, authorized, facilitated, or administered by public bodies or their agencies or authorities, except that work on a project receiving financial assistance from the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA) is not public work unless it is subject to State prevailing wage requirements pursuant to sections 7 and 42 of P.L.1983, c.530 (C.55:14K-7 and 55:14K-42).

(cf: P.L.1963, c.150, s.16) 3.    Section 1 of P.L.1996, c.71 (C.34:11-56.47) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a.  Any person who submits a bid directly to a public body for a contract for any public work subject to the provisions of the "New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act," P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) and is not awarded the contract and whose bid is the lowest bid other than the bid accepted by the public body or, if, pursuant to law, the contract is awarded on the basis of factors other than or in addition to the lowest bid, whose bid is the highest in rank other than the bid accepted by the public body (hereinafter referred to in this section as the "plaintiff") may bring an action for damages in a court of competent jurisdiction against the contractor who was directly awarded the contract by the public body or any subcontractor of that contractor (hereinafter referred to in this section as the "defendant") alleging that the defendant has, in connection with work performed pursuant to the contract, violated the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) or failed to pay any contribution, tax, assessment or benefit required by any other applicable law. If there is more than one losing bidder, a bidder with a higher bid than the second lowest bidder or lower rank than the second highest rank, if, pursuant to law, the contract is awarded on the basis of factors other than or in addition to the lowest bid, may bring the action if that bidder gives written notice of his intention to bring an action, sent by first-class mail and certified mail, return receipt requested, to every other losing bidder whose bid was lower than his or whose bid was higher in rank than his and none of the bidders notified files an action within 30 days following the date of their receipt of notice.  The written notice of intention to bring an action must contain the following: (1) a statement of the specific violations or failures to pay allegedly committed, which shall not preclude, in the course of the action, consideration of other violations or failures to pay as may be revealed in the course of discovery, (2) a statement that the action is to be filed pursuant to this act, and (3) a statement that the recipient of the notice may have the right to file an action and will be precluded from doing so if he does not file an action within 30 days of his receipt of the notice.  If no other losing bidder so notified files an action within 30 days of his receipt of the notice, the losing bidder who sent the notice shall file an action pursuant to this act within 15 days of the last day any of the recipients of the notice could have filed an action.  If more than one bidder files an action, all actions other than that filed by the bidder whose bid is the lowest of the bidders who filed actions, or, if, pursuant to law, the contract is awarded on the basis of factors other than or in addition to the lowest bid, whose bid is the highest in rank of the bidders who filed actions, shall be dismissed. b.  Upon a finding by the court that the plaintiff was a responsible bidder for the contract and a finding that one or more defendants violated the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) or failed to pay any contribution, tax, assessment or benefit required by any other applicable law in connection with work performed pursuant to the contract, and that the plaintiff submitted a bid for the contract which was less than the sum total of the bid accepted by the public body plus any additional amount that the defendant or defendants would have paid during the term of the contract to be in full compliance with P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) and other applicable laws in connection with the contract, the court shall order the defendant or defendants to pay to the plaintiff the entire amount of damages sustained plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees or, if the court finds the noncompliance to be intentional, three times the amount of damages sustained plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees, except that the court shall order no payment to the plaintiff if the court finds that the violation or failure to pay was caused by minor record keeping mistakes or minor computational errors or by other minor mistakes.  The occurrence of more than two violations or failures to pay shall lead to the rebuttable presumption that the violation or failure to pay at issue is not minor.  If there are two or more defendants, the court shall allocate the payments for damages sustained and attorney's fees among the defendants in a reasonable manner.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring payments to a plaintiff by any contractor or subcontractor who has not violated the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) or failed to pay any contribution, tax, assessment or benefit required by any other applicable law in connection with work performed pursuant to the contract.  A plaintiff may designate an agent or representative to maintain the action if the violation or failure to pay has an adverse effect on the agent or representative or, if the agent or representative is an organization or association, on any member of the organization or association.  If the plaintiff prevails, the agent or representative shall be entitled to reimbursement for costs and reasonable attorney's fees of the agent or representative but not to a financial interest in the damages awarded. c.  For the purposes of this section, the damages sustained by a plaintiff shall include the plaintiff's costs of preparing and submitting the bid and may, if sought by the plaintiff, include profits that the court determines the plaintiff would have made if the plaintiff had been awarded the contract and complied with P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) and other applicable laws. d.  If the court determines that the defendant did not, in connection with work performed pursuant to the contract, violate the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) or fail to pay any contribution, tax, assessment or benefit required by other applicable law, the court shall order the plaintiff to pay the costs and reasonable attorney's fees of the defendant.  Nothing herein shall preclude a defendant who is found to have committed minor record keeping mistakes, minor computational errors or other minor mistakes from being awarded relief pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1988, c.46 (C.2A:15-59.1). e. If a construction project is undertaken by a public institution of higher education, in which the construction project is intended for use by a public institution of higher education at the time of construction, the public body shall be subject to the requirements of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.).  If the public institution of higher education, the public body, violates the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.), the public institution of higher education will be subject to the penalties defined under P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.). f.  As used in this section: "Person" means any individual, corporation, company, partnership, firm, association or business; "Contractor" means a person who is directly awarded a contract for a public work by a public body; and "Subcontractor" means any subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor of a contractor. (cf: P.L.1996, c.71, s.1) 4.    Section 19 of P.L.1986, c.43 (C.18A:64-70) is amended to read as follows: 19.  All contracts or agreements for the purchase of goods and services, as distinct from contracts or agreements for the construction of buildings and other improvements, which require public advertisement for bids shall be awarded by the board of trustees to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the State college, price and other factors considered,  Each worker employed by the selected bidder shall be paid the prevailing wage determined by the Commissioner of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the "New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act," P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) if the project is intended for use by the State college at the time of construction. Prior to the award of any contract or agreement which does not require public advertisement, the estimated cost of which is 20 percent or more of the amount set forth in this act or, commencing January 1, 1985, 20 percent of the amount determined by the Governor pursuant to subsection b. of section 3 of this act, the contracting agent shall, except in the case of professional services, solicit quotations therefor whenever practicable, and the award thereof shall be made, in accordance with section 3 of this article, on the basis of the quotation, conforming to the request for proposals, which is most advantageous to the State college, price and other factors considered; however, if the contracting agent deems it impractical to solicit competitive quotations or having sought the quotations determines that the award should not be made on that basis, the contracting agent shall file a statement of explanation of the reason or reasons therefor, which shall be placed on file with the purchase, contract, or agreement.
