Section 1:
A1087 ASSEMBLY, No. 1087 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  JOHN DIMAIO District 23 (Hunterdon, Somerset and Warren) SYNOPSIS Exempts certain municipalities from payment for certain State Police services. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the Division of State Police and supplementing Chapter 2 of Title 53 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    A municipality without a full-time police department or force, which receives patrol or general police services from the Division of State Police, shall continue to not be required to pay for these services. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall be retroactive to July 1, 2001. STATEMENT The bill would continue to exempt municipalities without a full-time police department or force, which receive patrol and general police services, from paying for these services. R.S.53:2-1, which defined the powers and duties of the New Jersey State Police upon its founding in 1921, requires that the State Police provide adequate police protection to the inhabitants of rural sections. The Governor's recommended budget for FY 2003, however would require that these rural municipalities that are served by State Police pay for these services. Currently, the State Police furnish full-time police protection to 73 municipalities and part-time protection to 24 municipalities. It is the sponsor's view that municipalities should not be required to pay for these services since a primary function of the New Jersey State Police is to provide protection to such municipalities.
