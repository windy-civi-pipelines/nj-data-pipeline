concerning certain assistance and set-aside programs for businesses owned by
lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender persons, businesses owned by persons

parts of the statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:
150%'> </span><i>by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The economy of the
State of New Jersey is vitally dependent upon the health and stability of the
small and independent businesses in the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The future welfare of
the State depends on the continued existence and development of these same
small and independent businesses;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Despite their
contribution as major generators of employment, small businesses are struggling
to survive in the private sector;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Due to a historical
legacy of disregard and discrimination toward persons with differing sexual
orientations and gender identities or expressions, and toward persons with a
disability, and due to lost opportunities suffered by veterans, these groups
control a disproportionately small fraction of the productive resources of the
State and are, therefore, largely excluded from the mainstream of the overall
economy; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Problems of inadequate
capital and management expertise that pertain to businesses owned by persons
with differing sexual orientations and gender identities or expressions,
persons with a disability, and veterans are the same problems that pertain, in
varying degrees, to all small businesses;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The public sector, at
both the national and State levels, has recognized the appropriateness of the
role of encouraging small businesses generally and persons with differing
sexual orientations and gender identities or expressions, persons with a
disability, and veterans in particular;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Economic development
within populations of  persons with differing sexual orientations and gender
identities or expressions, persons with a disability, and veterans increases
the prosperity of the entire State by generating revenues and reducing the
State burden of unemployment, welfare, and other supportive social services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    In order to promote
these goals, a permanent government entity, the New Jersey Economic Development
Authority, is given a long-term mandate for the delivery of financial and
overall assistance to diverse business communities, to include business
enterprises owned by persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender,
or LGBT, persons with a disability, and persons who are  veterans; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The authority should
focus its efforts clearly on areas of greatest need and have commitment toward
the establishment of quality programs;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     The authority should be
responsible, both directly and as an intermediary, for providing financing and
for coordinating a wide range of intensive and ongoing business expertise
programs;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    The authority should
pursue its mandate in accordance with a well-conceived business strategy and
underwriting standards that approximate those utilized by traditional lenders;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     The authoritys success
in fulfilling its mandate should be measured by the ultimate viability of the
enterprises it assists;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.   Small businesses, and
businesses owned by LGBT persons, persons with a disability, and veterans, in
particular, are often in need of financial and technical assistance which may
be unavailable to them through traditional sources;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.    It is the public policy
of this State to provide a source of technical assistance and financial
assistance in order to encourage the establishment and the growth of small
businesses and businesses owned by LGBT persons, persons with a disability, and
veterans; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     o.    It is the intention of
this Legislature that the Division of Revenue in the Department of the
Treasury, in concert with the authority, provide a full range of financial and
technical assistance to small businesses and businesses owned by LGBT persons,
persons with a disability, and veterans in order to ensure their success and
their growth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      2.   As

professional development.</p>

third-party agencies to perform the certifications, which it has the authority

develop a streamlined process for verification of eligible business. The
process for certification and verification is to be clear, concise, and
streamlined.  The director is to submit an annual report to the Governor and
Legislature concerning these processes.</p>

cost of a pilot program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also permits counties
and municipalities, as well as boards of education, to establish set-aside
programs for eligible businesses.  The goals set for the programs could be met
by the use of subcontracting.  The bill establishes requirements related to how
local governments and boards of education could administer those programs,
including advertising and bidding processes, and establishes penalties that
local governments and boards of education could assess against businesses that
are classified as eligible businesses based on false information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Local governments and boards
of education with these programs are to publish their attainments of the
set-aside goals in at least one newspaper in the county, municipality, or
