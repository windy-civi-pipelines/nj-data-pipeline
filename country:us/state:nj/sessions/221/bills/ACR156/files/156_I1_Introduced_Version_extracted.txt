If you are opposed thereto make a cross (X), plus (+) or check (a) in the square opposite the word "No." b. In every municipality the following question: CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM YES Do you approve amending the Constitution to place the right to reproductive freedom in the Constitution? Reproductive freedom includes the right to access contraception, choose or refuse sterilization, carry a pregnancy to term and give birth, or have an abortion. Currently, the right to reproductive freedom in New Jersey is established by court decisions and State statute. NO INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT This proposed amendment would establish in the New Jersey Constitution the right to reproductive freedom. Reproductive freedom includes the right to access contraception, choose or refuse sterilization, carry a pregnancy to term and give birth, or have an abortion. The amendment provides that the State and its political subdivisions, such as a county or municipality, cannot take any action that infringes on a persons right to reproductive freedom. Currently, the right to reproductive freedom in the State is established by court decisions and State statute.  This amendment would place the right to reproductive freedom in the State Constitution. STATEMENT This proposed constitutional amendment would set out the fundamental right to reproductive freedom in the State Constitution.  Reproductive freedom includes the right to access contraception, choose or refuse sterilization, carry a pregnancy to term and give birth, or have an abortion. Reproductive freedom in New Jersey is currently governed by case law and statute. The right to an abortion, in particular, is established by State case law, and was codified into statute by P.L.2021, c.375, commonly known as the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act.  Although the State right to an abortion is not expressly written in the New Jersey Constitution, New Jersey courts have inferred the existence of this right based on the State Constitutions broad protections of individual rights to privacy and liberty, and have concluded that the New Jersey Constitution protects a pregnant persons right to an abortion in the State.
