Fire Safety in the Department of Community Affairs to establish training course
materials regarding incentives to promote the recruitment and retention of
volunteer firefighters and requires the division to administer a website
dedicated to the recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7)  provides a $1,000 gross
income tax credit to taxpayers that are members of a volunteer fire company and
perform at least 100 hours of volunteer service to the company each year.  To
be eligible for a credit, a taxpayer would be required to obtain certification
