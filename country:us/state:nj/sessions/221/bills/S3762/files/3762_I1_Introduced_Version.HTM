<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A hospital service
corporation contract that provides hospital and medical expense benefits and is
delivered, issued, executed, or renewed in this State, or approved for issuance
or renewal in this State by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, on or
after the effective date of this act, shall provide coverage for expenses
incurred for the services of a qualified sign language interpreter during a health
care encounter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Coverage shall be provided,
upon the request of an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing, as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the services of a
qualified sign language interpreter; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  video remote interpreter
services in situations in which the in-person services of a qualified sign
language interpreter are not available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Coverage shall not be provided
for the services of a sign language interpreter who is a family member or
friend of the individual who is deaf or hard of hearing, unless the following
conditions have been satisfied:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the family member or
friend is a qualified sign language interpreter; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  the individual who is
deaf or hard of hearing has consented to having the family member or friend
serve as a sign language interpreter during the health care encounter; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  the individual who is
deaf or hard of hearing is a minor child, and the parent or legal guardian of
the minor child is present and agrees to provide sign language interpretation
services for the minor child, as necessary, during the health care encounter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   In a case of suspected
domestic violence, a health care provider shall not permit a family member to
serve as a sign language interpreter during the health care encounter, and
shall instead provide a qualified sign language interpreter or video remote
interpreter services for an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   In a case in which one
or both parents or a legal guardian is suspected of child abuse or neglect of a
minor child who is deaf or hard of hearing, the health care provider shall not
permit the parent or legal guardian to serve as a sign language interpreter
during the health care encounter, and shall instead provide a qualified sign
language interpreter for the minor child. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    As used in this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Deaf means the condition of
having sustained a hearing loss that is so severe that the individual has
difficulty in processing linguistic information through hearing, regardless of
amplification or other assistive technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Hard of hearing means the
condition of having sustained a hearing loss, whether permanent or fluctuating,
which hearing loss may be corrected by amplification or other hearing assistive
technology, but which, regardless of correction, presents challenges in
processing linguistic information through hearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualified sign language
interpreter means a sign language interpreter, preferably with expertise in a
medical setting, who is certified by the New Jersey Registry of Interpreters
for the Deaf, or by an accredited certifying organization designated by the
Division of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in the Department of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Video remote interpreting
services means remote sign language interpretation using real-time, full
motion video and audio over a dedicated high-speed, wide-bandwidth video
connection or a wireless connection that delivers high-quality video images
that do not produce lags, choppy, blurry, or grainy images, or irregular pauses
in communication, and that are large enough to display both the interpreters and
the participants face, arms, hands, and fingers.  The audio component of the
service should provide a clear, audible transmission of voices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The benefits required
by this section shall be provided to the same extent as for any other condition
under the contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     This section shall
apply to those hospital service corporation contracts in which the hospital
service corporation has reserved the right to change the premium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  A medical service
corporation contract that provides hospital and medical expense benefits and is
delivered, issued, executed, or renewed in this State, or approved for issuance
or renewal in this State by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, on or
after the effective date of this act, shall provide coverage for expenses

or friend of the individual who is deaf or hard of hearing, unless the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires private
health insurance plans, the State Health Benefits Program (SHBP), the School
Employees Health Benefits Program (SEHBP), and the NJ FamilyCare program to
cover the services of a qualified sign language interpreter during a medical encounter
for an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing.  A qualified sign language
interpreter is defined as an interpreter, preferably with expertise in medical
interpreting, who is certified by the New Jersey Registry of Interpreters for
the Deaf or by an accredited certifying organization designated by the Division
of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in the Department of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes a
minimum reimbursement rate of $42.40 per hour for sign language interpreter
services provided during a medical encounter for NJ FamilyCare enrollees, and
$42.53 when such services are provided for an individual covered under the SHBP
or the SEHBP.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, sign language
interpreter services would be provided upon the request of a patient who is
deaf or hard of hearing.  Video remote interpreter services also would be covered,
provided in person interpreter services are not available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill stipulates that
interpreter services will not be covered in situations in which such services
are provided by a family member or friend of the requester, unless: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    the family member or
friend is a qualified sign language interpreter; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    the individual requesting
sign language interpreter services consents to having the family member or
friend interpret during the medical encounter; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  the individual who is deaf
or hard of hearing is a minor, and the childs parent or legal guardian is present
and agrees to interpret during the medical encounter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In cases of suspected domestic
violence, a health care provider is prohibited from allowing a family member to
serve as a sign language interpreter during a health care encounter for an
individual who is deaf or hard of hearing; rather, the bill requires the health
care provider to provide a qualified sign language interpreter or video remote
interpreter services during the encounter.  In cases of suspected child abuse
or neglect by a parent or legal guardian, the health care provider may not
permit the parent or guardian to serve as a sign language interpreter for a
minor child who is deaf or hard of hearing.  The bill instead requires the
health care provider to provide a qualified sign language interpreter for the
child during the encounter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     NJ FamilyCare coverage of, and
the reimbursement rate for, interpreter services will be contingent upon federal
approval of the States application for any requisite Medicaid or CHIP waivers
or state plan amendments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), Pub.L.101-336 (42 U.S.C., s. 12101 et seq.) and federal
regulations grant individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing the legal right
to equal access to, and an equal opportunity to participate in and benefit
from, health care. Federal regulations permit the use of sign language
interpreters as one of the acceptable auxiliary aids and services that
medical providers are required to furnish to ensure accessible and effective
communication with patients who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Federal regulations prohibit medical
providers from billing patients for the provision of sign language interpretation;
rather, medical providers are advised to treat expenditures on interpreter
services as an administrative or an overhead cost of their practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The ADA provides a limited exemption
for medical providers who demonstrate that furnishing a specific auxiliary aid or
service, as requested by a patient with a disability, would present an undue
burden or cause a fundamental change in the nature of the providers services
and goods.  In such instances, however, the ADA stipulates that the medical
provider must furnish an alternative auxiliary aid or service that would not
present an undue burden and would facilitate effective provider-patient
communications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent to
codify existing federal requirements concerning sign language interpreter
services to ensure that private health insurance plans, the SHBP, the SEHBP,
and the NJ FamilyCare program, cover sign language interpreter services during
medical encounters for enrollees who are deaf or hard of hearing. </p>
