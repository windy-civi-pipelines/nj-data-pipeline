They worked three shifts, seven days a week in poor conditions, including no heat and minimal lighting, rodent infestations, and mold and mildew.  The women had to shower outside, and many became sick; and Whereas, Despite experiencing difficult working conditions, racism, and sexism, the Six Triple Eight successfully completed their task in just three months, sorting, redirecting, repackaging, and censoring approximately 17.5 million pieces of mail, most of which was illegible, torn, smeared, and poorly addressed, for delivery to seven million American service members and civilian personnel stationed in Europe; and Whereas, Shortly thereafter, the Six Triple Eight was moved to France to complete an identical job of redirecting backlogged mail which was completed three months earlier than the established deadline; and Whereas, On February 27, 1946, the Six Triple Eight boarded the SS Claymont Victory for its return to the United States and was disbanded in March 1946 at Fort Dix, New Jersey; and Whereas, On March 14, 2022, President Biden signed a bill to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion; and Whereas, At least 28 women from New Jersey served in the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, including Velma Jerome Arkward, Gladys Beatrice Avant, Bernice S.
