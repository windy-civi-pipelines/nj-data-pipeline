the patient is eligible for participation in a public assistance program.  If
the employee concludes that the patient may be eligible for a public assistance
program, the employee shall so advise the patient, family member, responsible

an educational service agency, and for this purpose the term &quot;educational

institution has made an offer of employment in the following academic year or

in the following academic year or term was made by an individual with actual
authority to offer employment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (C)  The employment offered in
the following academic year or term shall be in the same capacity;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (D)  The economic conditions
of the employment offered may not be considerably less in the following
academic year or term than in the then current academic year or term.  For the
purpose of this paragraph, &quot;considerably less&quot; means that the
claimant will earn less than 90 percent of the amount the claimant earned in
the then current academic year or term;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (E)  The offer of employment
in the following academic year or term is not contingent upon a factor or
factors that are within the educational institution's control, including but
not limited to, course programming, decisions on how to allocate available
funding, final course offerings, program changes, and facility availability;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (F)  Based on a totality of
the circumstances, it is highly probable that there is a job available for the
claimant in the following academic year or term.  If a job offer contains a
contingency, primary weight should be given to the contingent nature of the
offer of employment. Contingencies that are not necessarily within the
educational institution's control, such as funding, enrollment and seniority,
may be taken into consideration but the existence of any one contingency should
not determine whether it is highly probable that there is a job available for
the claimant in the following academic year or term. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  Determinations by the
department whether claimants have a &quot;reasonable assurance&quot; shall be
done on a case-by-case basis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)  Each educational
institution shall provide the following to the department, in a form, including
electronic form, prescribed by the commissioner, no less than 10 business days
prior to the end of the academic year or term:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (A)  A list of all employees
who the educational institution has concluded do not have a reasonable
assurance of employment in the following academic year or term, along with
information prescribed by the commissioner regarding each such employee, which
information shall include, but not be limited to, name and social security
number; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B)  For each employee that
the educational institution maintains does have a reasonable assurance of
employment in the following academic year or term, a statement explaining the
manner in which the employee was given a reasonable assurance of employment,
that is, whether it was in writing, oral, or implied, and what information
about the offer, including contingencies, was communicated to the individual.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)  The statement required
under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (7) of this subsection (g) may be used by
the department in its analysis under paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection
(g), but it does not conclusively demonstrate that the claimant has a
reasonable assurance of employment in the following academic year or term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)  Failure of an educational
institution to provide the statement required under subparagraph (B) of
paragraph (7) of this subsection (g) not less than 10 business days prior to
the end of the academic year or term shall result in a rebuttable presumption
that the claimant does not have a reasonable assurance of employment in the
following academic year or term.  This rebuttable presumption shall give rise
to an inference that the claimant does not have a reasonable assurance of
employment in the following academic year or term, but shall not conclusively
demonstrate that the claimant does not have a reasonable assurance of
employment in the following academic year or term. </p>

the conflicting part of that act is inoperative solely to the extent of the
conflict, and the finding or determination does not affect the operation of the
remainder of this act.  Rules adopted under this act shall meet federal

the State or the granting of federal unemployment tax credits to employers in
this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill replaces the terms
alien and illegal alien in the New Jersey statutes with the terms foreign
national and undocumented foreign national, respectively, when referring to
a person in the context of his legal status.  This bill also ensures that
executive branch agencies discontinue use of those terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill removes from State
law the offensive language characterizing persons who are immigrants as
aliens or illegal aliens and prohibits State executive agencies from using those
terms in any proposed or final rule, regulation, interpretation, publication, or
other document, display, or sign issued by the agency after the effective date
of this bill, except to the extent that they are used in quoting or reproducing
text written by a source other than an officer or employee of the agency. 
Similar legislation was introduced in Congress on October 21, 2015, by
Congressman Joaquin Castro.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The United States is a nation
of immigrants, and as such, our laws should discontinue the use of terms that
ostracize those in our society who may have been born elsewhere. Regardless of
status, immigrants to our nation are first and foremost human beings. Removing
the terms alien and illegal alien from this States laws shows respect to
the hundreds of millions of descendants of immigrants who call the United
States home.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Especially in the context of
an issue as contentious as immigration, discontinuing use of the terms alien
and illegal alien will help reduce the prejudice that has skewed discussions
concerning immigration and offer recognition of immigrants personhood in the
laws of this State. </p>
