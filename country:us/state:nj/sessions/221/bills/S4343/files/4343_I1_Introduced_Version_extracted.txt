As used in this section, the term "development ordinances" shall not include residential parking standards set forth in a redevelopment plan adopted under the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.1993, c.32, s.5) 7.  Section 13 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-53.2) is amended to read as follows: 13.  a.  (1)  The chief financial officer of a municipality shall make [all of the] payments to professionals for services rendered to the municipality or approving authority for review of applications for development, review and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements, or other purposes under the provisions of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.).  [Such] Professional fees or charges shall be based upon a schedule established by resolution.  The application review and inspection charges shall be limited only to professional charges for review of applications, review and preparation of documents and inspections of developments under construction and review by outside consultants when an application is of a nature beyond the scope of the expertise of the professionals normally utilized by the municipality.  The only costs that [shall] may be added to [any such] a professionals fees or charges shall be actual out-of-pocket expenses of [any such] the professionals or consultants, including normal and typical expenses incurred in processing applications and inspecting improvements. (2)  The municipality or approving authority shall not bill the applicant, or charge [any] an escrow account or deposit authorized under subsection b. of this section, for [any] municipal clerical or administrative functions, overhead expenses, meeting room charges, or [any] other municipal costs and expenses, except as provided for in this section, nor shall a municipal professional [add any such] include these types of charges [to his] in the professionals bill.  If the salary, staff support and overhead for a municipal professional are provided by the municipality, the charge shall not exceed 200% of the sum of the products resulting from multiplying [(1)] the hourly base salary, which shall be established annually by ordinance, of each of the professionals by [(2)] the number of hours spent by the respective professional upon review of the application for development or inspection of the developer's improvements, as the case may be.

(cf: P.L.1995, c.54, s.1) 8.  Section 3 of P.L.1995, c.54 (C.40:55D-53.2a) is amended to read as follows: 3.  a.  (1)  An applicant [shall notify] may dispute a fee or charge requested by a professional by either: notifying, in writing, the governing body [with] of the municipality and by delivering copies to the chief financial officer [,] and the approving authority of the municipality, and to the professional [whenever the applicant disputes the charges made by a professional for service rendered to the municipality in reviewing applications for development, review and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements, or other charges made pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.).  The governing body, or its designee, shall within a reasonable time period attempt to remediate any disputed charges.  If the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the applicant, the applicant may] whose fees or charges are the subject of the dispute; or by submitting an appeal to the county construction board of appeals established under section 9 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-127) [any charge to an escrow account or a deposit by any municipal professional or consultant, or the cost of the installation of improvements estimated by the municipal engineer pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-53.4)], and simultaneously notifying, in writing, the governing body, the chief financial officer, and the approving authority of the municipality, and the professional whose fees or charges are the subject of the dispute.  An applicant or [his] the applicants authorized agent [shall submit the appeal in writing to the county construction board of appeals.  The applicant or his authorized agent shall simultaneously send a copy of the appeal to the municipality, approving authority, and any professional whose charge is the subject of the appeal.  An applicant shall file an appeal within 45 days from receipt of the informational copy of the professional's voucher required by subsection c. of section 13 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-53.2), except that if the professional has not supplied the applicant with an informational copy of the voucher, then the applicant shall file his appeal within 60 days from receipt of the municipal statement of activity against the deposit or escrow account required by subsection c. of section 13 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-53.2).  An applicant] may [file an] appeal [for] an ongoing series of charges submitted by a professional [during a period not exceeding six months] to demonstrate that [they represent] the series of charges represent a pattern of excessive or inaccurate charges.  An applicant making use of this provision need not appeal each charge individually. (2)  An applicant may submit an appeal disputing a professionals charges at any time up to and including the 20th day following the issuance of the permanent certificate of occupancy for the development, unit, lot, building, or phase of development. b.  The governing body of the municipality or the county construction board of appeals shall hear the appeal, render a decision thereon, and file its decision with a statement of the reasons therefor with [the municipality or] the applicant, the professional, and the chief financial officer, the governing body, and the approving authority of the municipality, not later than 10 business days following the submission of the appeal to the governing body or the board, unless [such period of time has been extended with the consent of] the applicant has consented to an extension of this time period.  The [decision] governing body of the municipality or the county construction board of appeals may approve, disapprove, or modify the disputed professional charges [appealed from].  [A] The governing body of the municipality or the county construction board of appeals shall deliver a copy of the decision [shall be forwarded] by certified or registered mail to the party [making the appeal] who submitted the dispute, the [municipality,] chief financial officer, the governing body, and the approving authority of the municipality, and the professional involved [in the appeal].  Failure by a municipal governing body or the board to hear an appeal and render and file a decision thereon within the time limits prescribed in this subsection shall be deemed a denial of [the] an appeal for purposes of enabling an applicant to initiate a complaint, application, or appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction. c.  The county construction board of appeals shall [provide] promulgate rules for [its procedure] processing a dispute in accordance with this section.  The board shall have the power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant evidence, and the provisions of the "County and Municipal Investigations Law," P.L.1953, c.38 (C.2A:67A-1 et seq.) shall apply. d.  During the pendency of [any] an appeal over a professionals charges, the [municipality] governing body or approving authority of the municipality shall continue to process, hear, and decide the application for development, and to inspect the development in the normal course, and shall not withhold, delay, or deny reviews, inspections, signing of subdivision plats or site plans, the reduction or the release of performance or maintenance guarantees, the issuance of construction permits or certificates of occupancy, or any other approval or permit because an appeal has been filed or is pending under this section.  The chief financial officer of the municipality may pay charges out of the appropriate escrow account or deposit for which an appeal has been filed.  If a charge is disallowed after payment, the chief financial officer of the municipality shall reimburse the deposit or escrow account in the amount of any such disallowed charge or refund the amount to the applicant.  If a charge is disallowed after payment to a professional or consultant who is not an employee of the municipality, the professional or consultant shall reimburse the municipality in the amount of any such disallowed charge. e.  The Commissioner of Community Affairs shall promulgate rules and regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to effectuate the purposes of this section.  Within two years of the effective date of [P.L.1995, c.54 (C.40:55D-53.2a et al.)] P.L.    , c.     (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the commissioner shall prepare and submit a report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the General Assembly.  The report shall describe the appeals process established by section 3 of P.L.1995, c.54 (C.40:55D-53.2a), as amended by P.L.    , c.     (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and shall make recommendations for legislative or administrative action necessary to provide a fair and efficient appeals process. (cf: P.L.1995, c.54, s.3) 9.  Section 20 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-69.1) is amended to read as follows: 20.  If the zoning board of adjustment or supplemental zoning board of adjustment lacks a quorum because any of its regular or alternate members is prohibited by section 56 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-69) or section 1 of P.L.2019, c.225 (C.40:55D-69.2) from acting on a matter due to the member's personal or financial interest therein, Class IV members of the planning board shall be called upon to serve, for that matter only, as temporary members of the zoning board of adjustment or supplemental zoning board of adjustment.  The Class IV members of the planning board shall be called upon to serve in order of seniority of continuous service to the planning board until there are the minimum number of members necessary to constitute a quorum to act upon the matter without any personal or financial interest therein, whether direct or indirect.  However, if an application for development involves a request for a variance under subsection d. of section 57 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-70), then Class IV members of the planning board shall be called upon to serve until the zoning board of adjustment has a full complement of seven members.  If a choice has to be made between Class IV members of equal seniority, the chairman of the planning board shall make the choice. (cf: P.L.2019, c.225, s.3) 10.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall be applicable to applications for development certified to be complete on and after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill proposes several amendments to the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.).  Specifically: Section 1 of the bill would amend section 2 of the MLUL (C.40:55D-2), the provision which sets forth the "intent and purpose" of the MLUL, to clarify that a current MLUL purpose: to "encourage coordination of the various public and private procedures and activities shaping land development with a view of lessening the cost of such development," includes the cost of processing applications for development. Section 2 of the bill would amend section 8 of P.L.1979, c.216 (C.40:55D-10.1) to require a zoning board of adjustment (ZBA) to grant a non-binding informal review of a developers concept plan.  Current law requires a planning board but not a ZBA to grant a non-binding informal concept plan review. Section 3 of the bill would amend section 5 of P.L.1984, c.20 (C.40:55D-10.3) to specify a 14-day period for the review of a resubmitted application for development during the completeness determination.  Specifically, after an applicant has been notified of deficiencies in a prior application for development, the bill would require the municipal agency, or its authorized committee or designee, to either certify a resubmitted application to be complete within 14 days of the date of its submission, or the application would be deemed complete, unless: the application lacks information indicated on a checklist adopted by ordinance and provided to the applicant; and the municipal agency or its authorized committee or designee has notified the applicant, in writing, of the deficiencies in the application within 14 days of submission of the application. Section 4 of the bill would supplement the MLUL by requiring the Department of Community Affairs to adopt model forms for applications for development, and model forms for checklists, for the purpose of providing municipal agencies the option to adopt uniform standardized application forms and checklists. Section 5 of the bill would amend section 13 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-22) to establish timeframes for the review of resolution compliance submissions.  Generally, a resolution memorializing the approval of an MLUL application for development sets forth conditions that must be fulfilled before an applicants site plan or subdivision map can be signed or a zoning permit and building permit can be issued.  Current law does not specify a timeframe for municipal agency consideration of an applicants resolution compliance submissions.  The bill specifically would require a municipal agency, or its designee, to review and verify the submitted proof of the fulfillment of conditions, and respond to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of an initial submission, and, if applicable, within 15 days of receipt of a subsequent submission.  The bill would allow a municipal agency, or its designee, and an applicant to agree to extensions of time.  Under the bill, if a municipal agency or its designee fails to respond, the applicant may institute a summary action in court to compel the municipal agency or its designee to respond, in writing, and to impose costs and attorney fees against the municipality. Section 6 of the bill would amend section 5 of P.L.1993, c.32 (C.40:55D-40.5) to provide that residential parking standards set forth in a redevelopment plan, adopted under the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.), control the parking requirements for the redevelopment project rather than the residential parking standards set forth in the Residential Site Improvement Standards. Section 7 of the bill would amend section 13 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-53.2) to require each professional who rendered services to a municipality or approving authority under the Municipal Land Use Law to submit to the chief financial officer of the municipality, prior to March 1 of each year, an annual statement setting forth a compilation of the following information: · the dollar amount billed for services rendered on each application for development over the prior calendar year; · the dollar amount collected for services rendered on each application for development over the prior calendar year; · the total dollar amount billed for services rendered on each application for development between the date of submission of the application for development and the date of submission of the annual statement; and · the total dollar amount collected for services rendered on each application for development between the date of submission of the application for development and the date of submission of the annual statement. Additionally, section 7 of the bill would require the Department of Community Affairs, prior to the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, to adopt a form for each professional to use when preparing and submitting an annual statement reporting the amount billed and collected on each application for development.  This section would also require a municipality that maintains an Internet website to post and display thereon each annual statement received by the municipalitys chief financial officer from a professional who rendered services to the municipality or an approving authority of the municipality. Finally, section 7 of the bill includes technical amendments to clarify the process for a professional to submit vouchers to the chief financial officer of the municipality when requesting release of payments from amounts deposited by a developer, and held in escrow by the municipality, for payments to professionals.  Technical amendments to this section clarify that a professionals voucher is required to identify the personnel performing the service, and for each date of service: the services performed, the hours spent to one-quarter hour increments, the hourly rate, and the expenses incurred. Section 8 of the bill amends section 3 of P.L.1995, c.54 (C.40:55D-53.2a) to address the ability of an applicant to dispute amounts a professional charges for reviewing an application for development, et al.  Current law affords a municipal governing body a "reasonable time period" to attempt to remediate disputed charges, and allows an applicant to appeal a professional fee dispute to the county construction board of appeals, if the matter is not resolved by the governing body to the applicants satisfaction, within 45 days of receipt of the informational copy of the professionals voucher.  The bill would delete current laws process, through which a municipal governing body may attempt to mediate a dispute over a professionals fees and charges, and instead allow an applicant to submit a dispute directly to the county construction board of appeals for nonbinding mediation. Current law requires an applicant to file an appeal disputing a professionals charges within 45 days following the applicants receipt of an informational copy of a professional's voucher, or if the professional has not supplied the applicant with an informational copy of the voucher, within 60 days following the applicants receipt of the municipal statement of activity against the deposit or escrow account.  The bill would amend these provisions to allow an applicant, who was not provided an informational copy of a professional's voucher by the professional, to initiate a dispute of a professionals charges at any time at any time up to the 20th day following the issuance of the permanent certificate of occupancy for the development. Section 9 of the bill would amend section 20 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-69.1) to provide that, if an application for development involves a request for a variance under subsection d. of section 57 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-70), then Class IV members of the planning board shall be called upon to serve until the zoning board of adjustment has a full complement of seven members.  Current law provides that if a zoning board of adjustment does not have a quorum, then planning board members are called upon to serve until there are the minimum number of members necessary for a quorum. The bill also makes additional technical changes.

(6)  If an escrow account or deposit contains insufficient funds to enable the municipality or approving authority to perform required application reviews or improvement inspections, the chief financial officer of the municipality shall provide the applicant with a notice of the insufficient escrow or deposit balance.  In order for work to continue on the development or the application, the applicant shall within a reasonable time period post a deposit to the account in an amount to be agreed upon by the municipality or approving authority and the applicant.  In the interim, any required health and safety inspections shall be made and charged back against the replenishment of funds. (7)  A professional who rendered services to a municipality or approving authority for review of applications for development, review and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements or other purposes under the provisions of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) during a calendar year shall, annually, prior to the following March 1, submit to the chief financial officer of the municipality an annual statement setting forth a compilation of the following information: (a)  the dollar amount billed for services rendered on each application for development over the prior calendar year; (b)  the dollar amount collected for services rendered on each application for development over the prior calendar year; (c)  the total dollar amount billed for services rendered on each application for development between the date of submission of the application for development and the date of submission of the annual statement; (d)  the total dollar amount collected for services rendered on each application for development between the date of submission of the application for development and the date of submission of the annual statement.

(9)  A municipality that maintains an Internet website shall post and display thereon each annual statement received by the municipalitys chief financial officer from a professional who rendered services to the municipality or an approving authority of the municipality. d.  The following close-out procedure shall apply to all deposits and escrow accounts established under the provisions of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) and shall commence after the approving authority has granted final approval and signed the subdivision plat or site plan, in the case of application review escrows and deposits, or after the improvements have been approved as provided in section 41 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-53), in the case of improvement inspection escrows and deposits.  The applicant shall send written notice by certified mail to the chief financial officer of the municipality and the approving authority, and to the relevant municipal professional, that the application or the improvements, as the case may be, are completed.  After receipt of such notice, the professional shall render a final bill to the chief financial officer of the municipality within 30 days, and shall send a copy simultaneously to the applicant.  The chief financial officer of the municipality shall render a written final accounting to the applicant on the uses to which the deposit was put within 45 days of receipt of the final bill.  Any balances remaining in the deposit or escrow account, including interest in accordance with section 1 of P.L.1985, c.315 (C.40:55D-53.1), shall be refunded to the developer along with the final accounting. e.  All professional charges for review of an application for development, review and preparation of documents or inspection of improvements shall be reasonable and necessary, given the status and progress of the application or construction.  Review fees shall be charged only in connection with an application for development presently pending before the approving authority or upon review of compliance with conditions of approval, or review of requests for modification or amendment made by the applicant.  A professional shall not review items which are subject to approval by [any] a State governmental agency and not under municipal jurisdiction except to the extent consultation with a State agency is necessary due to the effect of State approvals in the subdivision or site plan.  Inspection fees shall be charged only for actual work shown on a subdivision or site plan or required by an approving resolution.  Professionals inspecting improvements under construction shall charge only for inspections that are reasonably necessary to check the progress and quality of the work and such inspections shall be reasonably based on the approved development plans and documents. f.  If the municipality retains a different professional or consultant in the place of the professional originally responsible for development, application review, or inspection of improvements, the municipality or approving authority shall be responsible for all time and expenses of the new professional to become familiar with the application or the project, and the municipality or approving authority shall not bill the applicant or charge the deposit or the escrow account for any such services. (cf: P.L.1995, c.54, s.1) 8.  Section 3 of P.L.1995, c.54 (C.40:55D-53.2a) is amended to read as follows: 3.  a.  (1)  An applicant [shall notify] may dispute a fee or charge requested by a professional by either: notifying, in writing, the governing body [with] of the municipality and by delivering copies to the chief financial officer [,] and the approving authority of the municipality, and to the professional [whenever the applicant disputes the charges made by a professional for service rendered to the municipality in reviewing applications for development, review and preparation of documents, inspection of improvements, or other charges made pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.).  The governing body, or its designee, shall within a reasonable time period attempt to remediate any disputed charges.  If the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the applicant, the applicant may] whose fees or charges are the subject of the dispute; or by submitting an appeal to the county construction board of appeals established under section 9 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-127) [any charge to an escrow account or a deposit by any municipal professional or consultant, or the cost of the installation of improvements estimated by the municipal engineer pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-53.4)], and simultaneously notifying, in writing, the governing body, the chief financial officer, and the approving authority of the municipality, and the professional whose fees or charges are the subject of the dispute.  An applicant or [his] the applicants authorized agent [shall submit the appeal in writing to the county construction board of appeals.  The applicant or his authorized agent shall simultaneously send a copy of the appeal to the municipality, approving authority, and any professional whose charge is the subject of the appeal.  An applicant shall file an appeal within 45 days from receipt of the informational copy of the professional's voucher required by subsection c. of section 13 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-53.2), except that if the professional has not supplied the applicant with an informational copy of the voucher, then the applicant shall file his appeal within 60 days from receipt of the municipal statement of activity against the deposit or escrow account required by subsection c. of section 13 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-53.2).  An applicant] may [file an] appeal [for] an ongoing series of charges submitted by a professional [during a period not exceeding six months] to demonstrate that [they represent] the series of charges represent a pattern of excessive or inaccurate charges.  An applicant making use of this provision need not appeal each charge individually. (2)  An applicant may submit an appeal disputing a professionals charges at any time up to and including the 20th day following the issuance of the permanent certificate of occupancy for the development, unit, lot, building, or phase of development. b.  The governing body of the municipality or the county construction board of appeals shall hear the appeal, render a decision thereon, and file its decision with a statement of the reasons therefor with [the municipality or] the applicant, the professional, and the chief financial officer, the governing body, and the approving authority of the municipality, not later than 10 business days following the submission of the appeal to the governing body or the board, unless [such period of time has been extended with the consent of] the applicant has consented to an extension of this time period.  The [decision] governing body of the municipality or the county construction board of appeals may approve, disapprove, or modify the disputed professional charges [appealed from].  [A] The governing body of the municipality or the county construction board of appeals shall deliver a copy of the decision [shall be forwarded] by certified or registered mail to the party [making the appeal] who submitted the dispute, the [municipality,] chief financial officer, the governing body, and the approving authority of the municipality, and the professional involved [in the appeal].  Failure by a municipal governing body or the board to hear an appeal and render and file a decision thereon within the time limits prescribed in this subsection shall be deemed a denial of [the] an appeal for purposes of enabling an applicant to initiate a complaint, application, or appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction. c.  The county construction board of appeals shall [provide] promulgate rules for [its procedure] processing a dispute in accordance with this section.  The board shall have the power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant evidence, and the provisions of the "County and Municipal Investigations Law," P.L.1953, c.38 (C.2A:67A-1 et seq.) shall apply. d.  During the pendency of [any] an appeal over a professionals charges, the [municipality] governing body or approving authority of the municipality shall continue to process, hear, and decide the application for development, and to inspect the development in the normal course, and shall not withhold, delay, or deny reviews, inspections, signing of subdivision plats or site plans, the reduction or the release of performance or maintenance guarantees, the issuance of construction permits or certificates of occupancy, or any other approval or permit because an appeal has been filed or is pending under this section.  The chief financial officer of the municipality may pay charges out of the appropriate escrow account or deposit for which an appeal has been filed.  If a charge is disallowed after payment, the chief financial officer of the municipality shall reimburse the deposit or escrow account in the amount of any such disallowed charge or refund the amount to the applicant.  If a charge is disallowed after payment to a professional or consultant who is not an employee of the municipality, the professional or consultant shall reimburse the municipality in the amount of any such disallowed charge. e.  The Commissioner of Community Affairs shall promulgate rules and regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to effectuate the purposes of this section.  Within two years of the effective date of [P.L.1995, c.54 (C.40:55D-53.2a et al.)] P.L.    , c.     (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the commissioner shall prepare and submit a report to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the General Assembly.  The report shall describe the appeals process established by section 3 of P.L.1995, c.54 (C.40:55D-53.2a), as amended by P.L.    , c.     (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and shall make recommendations for legislative or administrative action necessary to provide a fair and efficient appeals process. (cf: P.L.1995, c.54, s.3) 9.  Section 20 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-69.1) is amended to read as follows: 20.  If the zoning board of adjustment or supplemental zoning board of adjustment lacks a quorum because any of its regular or alternate members is prohibited by section 56 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-69) or section 1 of P.L.2019, c.225 (C.40:55D-69.2) from acting on a matter due to the member's personal or financial interest therein, Class IV members of the planning board shall be called upon to serve, for that matter only, as temporary members of the zoning board of adjustment or supplemental zoning board of adjustment.  The Class IV members of the planning board shall be called upon to serve in order of seniority of continuous service to the planning board until there are the minimum number of members necessary to constitute a quorum to act upon the matter without any personal or financial interest therein, whether direct or indirect.  However, if an application for development involves a request for a variance under subsection d. of section 57 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-70), then Class IV members of the planning board shall be called upon to serve until the zoning board of adjustment has a full complement of seven members.  If a choice has to be made between Class IV members of equal seniority, the chairman of the planning board shall make the choice. (cf: P.L.2019, c.225, s.3) 10.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall be applicable to applications for development certified to be complete on and after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill proposes several amendments to the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.).  Specifically: Section 1 of the bill would amend section 2 of the MLUL (C.40:55D-2), the provision which sets forth the "intent and purpose" of the MLUL, to clarify that a current MLUL purpose: to "encourage coordination of the various public and private procedures and activities shaping land development with a view of lessening the cost of such development," includes the cost of processing applications for development. Section 2 of the bill would amend section 8 of P.L.1979, c.216 (C.40:55D-10.1) to require a zoning board of adjustment (ZBA) to grant a non-binding informal review of a developers concept plan.  Current law requires a planning board but not a ZBA to grant a non-binding informal concept plan review. Section 3 of the bill would amend section 5 of P.L.1984, c.20 (C.40:55D-10.3) to specify a 14-day period for the review of a resubmitted application for development during the completeness determination.  Specifically, after an applicant has been notified of deficiencies in a prior application for development, the bill would require the municipal agency, or its authorized committee or designee, to either certify a resubmitted application to be complete within 14 days of the date of its submission, or the application would be deemed complete, unless: the application lacks information indicated on a checklist adopted by ordinance and provided to the applicant; and the municipal agency or its authorized committee or designee has notified the applicant, in writing, of the deficiencies in the application within 14 days of submission of the application. Section 4 of the bill would supplement the MLUL by requiring the Department of Community Affairs to adopt model forms for applications for development, and model forms for checklists, for the purpose of providing municipal agencies the option to adopt uniform standardized application forms and checklists. Section 5 of the bill would amend section 13 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-22) to establish timeframes for the review of resolution compliance submissions.  Generally, a resolution memorializing the approval of an MLUL application for development sets forth conditions that must be fulfilled before an applicants site plan or subdivision map can be signed or a zoning permit and building permit can be issued.  Current law does not specify a timeframe for municipal agency consideration of an applicants resolution compliance submissions.  The bill specifically would require a municipal agency, or its designee, to review and verify the submitted proof of the fulfillment of conditions, and respond to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of an initial submission, and, if applicable, within 15 days of receipt of a subsequent submission.  The bill would allow a municipal agency, or its designee, and an applicant to agree to extensions of time.  Under the bill, if a municipal agency or its designee fails to respond, the applicant may institute a summary action in court to compel the municipal agency or its designee to respond, in writing, and to impose costs and attorney fees against the municipality. Section 6 of the bill would amend section 5 of P.L.1993, c.32 (C.40:55D-40.5) to provide that residential parking standards set forth in a redevelopment plan, adopted under the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.), control the parking requirements for the redevelopment project rather than the residential parking standards set forth in the Residential Site Improvement Standards. Section 7 of the bill would amend section 13 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-53.2) to require each professional who rendered services to a municipality or approving authority under the Municipal Land Use Law to submit to the chief financial officer of the municipality, prior to March 1 of each year, an annual statement setting forth a compilation of the following information: · the dollar amount billed for services rendered on each application for development over the prior calendar year; · the dollar amount collected for services rendered on each application for development over the prior calendar year; · the total dollar amount billed for services rendered on each application for development between the date of submission of the application for development and the date of submission of the annual statement; and · the total dollar amount collected for services rendered on each application for development between the date of submission of the application for development and the date of submission of the annual statement. Additionally, section 7 of the bill would require the Department of Community Affairs, prior to the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, to adopt a form for each professional to use when preparing and submitting an annual statement reporting the amount billed and collected on each application for development.  This section would also require a municipality that maintains an Internet website to post and display thereon each annual statement received by the municipalitys chief financial officer from a professional who rendered services to the municipality or an approving authority of the municipality. Finally, section 7 of the bill includes technical amendments to clarify the process for a professional to submit vouchers to the chief financial officer of the municipality when requesting release of payments from amounts deposited by a developer, and held in escrow by the municipality, for payments to professionals.  Technical amendments to this section clarify that a professionals voucher is required to identify the personnel performing the service, and for each date of service: the services performed, the hours spent to one-quarter hour increments, the hourly rate, and the expenses incurred. Section 8 of the bill amends section 3 of P.L.1995, c.54 (C.40:55D-53.2a) to address the ability of an applicant to dispute amounts a professional charges for reviewing an application for development, et al.  Current law affords a municipal governing body a "reasonable time period" to attempt to remediate disputed charges, and allows an applicant to appeal a professional fee dispute to the county construction board of appeals, if the matter is not resolved by the governing body to the applicants satisfaction, within 45 days of receipt of the informational copy of the professionals voucher.  The bill would delete current laws process, through which a municipal governing body may attempt to mediate a dispute over a professionals fees and charges, and instead allow an applicant to submit a dispute directly to the county construction board of appeals for nonbinding mediation. Current law requires an applicant to file an appeal disputing a professionals charges within 45 days following the applicants receipt of an informational copy of a professional's voucher, or if the professional has not supplied the applicant with an informational copy of the voucher, within 60 days following the applicants receipt of the municipal statement of activity against the deposit or escrow account.  The bill would amend these provisions to allow an applicant, who was not provided an informational copy of a professional's voucher by the professional, to initiate a dispute of a professionals charges at any time at any time up to the 20th day following the issuance of the permanent certificate of occupancy for the development. Section 9 of the bill would amend section 20 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-69.1) to provide that, if an application for development involves a request for a variance under subsection d. of section 57 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-70), then Class IV members of the planning board shall be called upon to serve until the zoning board of adjustment has a full complement of seven members.  Current law provides that if a zoning board of adjustment does not have a quorum, then planning board members are called upon to serve until there are the minimum number of members necessary for a quorum. The bill also makes additional technical changes.
