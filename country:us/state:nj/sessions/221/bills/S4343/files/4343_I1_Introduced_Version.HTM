<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill proposes several
amendments to the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et
seq.).  Specifically:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 1 of the bill would
amend section 2 of the MLUL (C.40:55D-2), the provision which sets forth the
&quot;intent and purpose&quot; of the MLUL, to clarify that a current MLUL
purpose: to &quot;encourage coordination of the various public and private
procedures and activities shaping land development with a view of lessening the
cost of such development,&quot; includes the cost of processing applications
for development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 2 of the bill would
amend section 8 of P.L.1979, c.216 (C.40:55D-10.1) to require a zoning board of
adjustment (ZBA) to grant a non-binding informal review of a developers
concept plan.  Current law requires a planning board but not a ZBA to grant a
non-binding informal concept plan review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 3 of the bill would
amend section 5 of P.L.1984, c.20 (C.40:55D-10.3) to specify a 14-day period
for the review of a resubmitted application for development during the
completeness determination.  Specifically, after an applicant has been notified
of deficiencies in a prior application for development, the bill would require
the municipal agency, or its authorized committee or designee, to either
certify a resubmitted application to be complete within 14 days of the date of
its submission, or the application would be deemed complete, unless: the
application lacks information indicated on a checklist adopted by ordinance and
provided to the applicant; and the municipal agency or its authorized committee
or designee has notified the applicant, in writing, of the deficiencies in the
application within 14 days of submission of the application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 4 of the bill would
supplement the MLUL by requiring the Department of Community Affairs to adopt
model forms for applications for development, and model forms for checklists,
for the purpose of providing municipal agencies the option to adopt uniform
standardized application forms and checklists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 5 of the bill would
amend section 13 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-22) to establish timeframes for
the review of resolution compliance submissions.  Generally, a resolution
memorializing the approval of an MLUL application for development sets forth
conditions that must be fulfilled before an applicants site plan or
subdivision map can be signed or a zoning permit and building permit can be
issued.  Current law does not specify a timeframe for municipal agency
consideration of an applicants resolution compliance submissions.  The bill
specifically would require a municipal agency, or its designee, to review and
verify the submitted proof of the fulfillment of conditions, and respond to the
applicant within 30 days of receipt of an initial submission, and, if
applicable, within 15 days of receipt of a subsequent submission.  The bill
would allow a municipal agency, or its designee, and an applicant to agree to extensions
of time.  Under the bill, if a municipal agency or its designee fails to
respond, the applicant may institute a summary action in court to compel the
municipal agency or its designee to respond, in writing, and to impose costs
and attorney fees against the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 6 of the bill would
amend section 5 of P.L.1993, c.32 (C.40:55D-40.5) to provide that residential
parking standards set forth in a redevelopment plan, adopted under the
&quot;Local Redevelopment and Housing Law,&quot; P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et
seq.), control the parking requirements for the redevelopment project rather
than the residential parking standards set forth in the Residential Site
Improvement Standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 7 of the bill would amend
section 13 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-53.2) to require each professional who
rendered services to a municipality or approving authority under the Municipal
Land Use Law to submit to the chief financial officer of the municipality,
prior to March 1 of each year, an annual statement setting forth a compilation
of the following information:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>the dollar amount billed for services rendered on each
application for development over the prior calendar year;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>the dollar amount collected for services rendered on each
application for development over the prior calendar year;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>the total dollar amount billed for services rendered on each
application for development between the date of submission of the application
for development and the date of submission of the annual statement; and</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>the total dollar amount collected for services rendered on each
application for development between the date of submission of the application
for development and the date of submission of the annual statement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, section 7 of the
bill would require the Department of Community Affairs, prior to the first day
of the fourth month next following enactment, to adopt a form for each
professional to use when preparing and submitting an annual statement reporting
the amount billed and collected on each application for development.  This
section would also require a municipality that maintains an Internet website to
post and display thereon each annual statement received by the municipalitys
chief financial officer from a professional who rendered services to the
municipality or an approving authority of the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, section 7 of the bill
includes technical amendments to clarify the process for a professional to
submit vouchers to the chief financial officer of the municipality when requesting
release of payments from amounts deposited by a developer, and held in escrow
by the municipality, for payments to professionals.  Technical amendments to
this section clarify that a professionals voucher is required to identify the
personnel performing the service, and for each date of service: the services
performed, the hours spent to one-quarter hour increments, the hourly rate, and
the expenses incurred.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 8 of the bill amends section
3 of P.L.1995, c.54 (C.40:55D-53.2a) to address the ability of an applicant to dispute
amounts a professional charges for reviewing an application for development, et
al.  Current law affords a municipal governing body a &quot;reasonable time
period&quot; to attempt to remediate disputed charges, and allows an applicant
to appeal a professional fee dispute to the county construction board of
appeals, if the matter is not resolved by the governing body to the applicants
satisfaction, within 45 days of receipt of the informational copy of the
professionals voucher.  The bill would delete current laws process, through
which a municipal governing body may attempt to mediate a dispute over a
professionals fees and charges, and instead allow an applicant to submit a dispute
directly to the county construction board of appeals for nonbinding mediation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law requires an
applicant to file an appeal disputing a professionals charges within 45 days
following the applicants receipt of an informational copy of a professional's
voucher, or if the professional has not supplied the applicant with an
informational copy of the voucher, within 60 days following the applicants
receipt of the municipal statement of activity against the deposit or escrow
account.  The bill would amend these provisions to allow an applicant, who was
not provided an informational copy of a professional's voucher by the
professional, to initiate a dispute of a professionals charges at any time at
any time up to the 20th day following the issuance of the permanent certificate
of occupancy for the development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 9 of the bill would
amend section 20 of P.L.1991, c.256 (C.40:55D-69.1) to provide that, if an application
for development involves a request for a variance under subsection d. of section
57 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-70), then Class IV members of the planning
board shall be called upon to serve until the zoning board of adjustment has a
full complement of seven members.  Current law provides that if a zoning board
of adjustment does not have a quorum, then planning board members are called
upon to serve until there are the minimum number of members necessary for a
quorum.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also makes additional
technical changes.</p>
