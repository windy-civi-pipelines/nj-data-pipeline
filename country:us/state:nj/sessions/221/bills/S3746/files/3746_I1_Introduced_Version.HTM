of N.J.S.2C:43-12 through N.J.S.2C:43-22 is to effectuate a Statewide program
of Pretrial Intervention. It is the policy of the State of New Jersey that
supervisory treatment should ordinarily be limited to persons who have not
previously been convicted of any criminal offense under the laws of New Jersey,
or under any criminal law of the United States, or any other state when
supervisory treatment would: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) Provide applicants, on an
equal basis, with opportunities to avoid ordinary prosecution by receiving
early rehabilitative services or supervision, when such services or supervision
can reasonably be expected to deter future criminal behavior by an applicant,
and when there is apparent causal connection between the offense charged and
the rehabilitative or supervisory need, without which cause both the alleged
offense and the need to prosecute might not have occurred; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Provide an alternative to
prosecution for applicants who might be harmed by the imposition of criminal
sanctions as presently administered, when such an alternative can be expected
to serve as sufficient sanction to deter criminal conduct; or </p>

permitting the least burdensome form of prosecution possible for defendants
charged with &quot;victimless&quot; offenses, other than defendants who were
public officers or employees charged with offenses that involved or touched
their office or employment; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) Provide assistance to
criminal calendars in order to focus expenditure of criminal justice resources
on matters involving serious criminality and severe correctional problems; or </p>

future criminal or disorderly behavior by an applicant in a program of
supervisory treatment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) Admission of an
applicant into a program of supervisory treatment shall be measured according
to the applicant's amenability to correction, responsiveness to rehabilitation
and the nature of the offense. </p>

presumption against admission into a program of supervisory treatment for: </p>

Act of 1991,&quot; P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.) or if the crime or
offense charged involved violence or the threat of violence. For purposes of

violence if the victim sustains serious or significant bodily injury as defined
in subsection </p>

reasons therefor made by the designated judges (or assignment judges),
prosecutors and program directors in granting or denying applications for

(C.2C:43-32 et al.), shall not be eligible for supervisory treatment under this
section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Except as otherwise
provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, supervisory treatment, as
provided herein, shall be available to a defendant irrespective of whether the
defendant contests his guilt of the charge or charges against him. </p>

persons or petty disorderly persons offense involving domestic violence, as

restraining order issued pursuant to the provisions of the &quot;Prevention of
Domestic Violence Act of 1991,&quot; P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.). For
any such defendant, following the plea of guilty the plea shall be held in an
inactive status pending termination of supervisory treatment pursuant to subsection
d. or e. of N.J.S.2C:43-13. Upon successful completion of the program of
supervisory treatment the charges shall be dismissed. </p>

of supervisory treatment under this section shall be immediately reported to

Directors; Authorized Referrals. Programs of supervisory treatment and

the consent of the assignment judge and prosecutor. Referrals of participants
from supervisory treatment programs may be to any public or private office or
agency, including but not limited to, programs within the probation service of
the court, offering counseling or any other social service likely to aid in the
rehabilitation of the participant and to deter the commission of other
offenses. </p>

Professional Licensing Board Notification. The program director shall promptly
notify the State Board of Medical Examiners when a State licensed physician or
podiatrist has been enrolled in a supervisory treatment program after he has
been charged with an offense involving drugs or alcohol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Attorney General shall
develop guidelines to ensure the uniform exercise of discretion by prosecutors

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would prohibit a
person who has been convicted of a criminal animal cruelty offense, for a
period of time specified by a court, from:  (1) commencing, operating, applying
for employment, being employed, or volunteering at, or participating in any
capacity in, an animal-related enterprise, as that term is defined in the
bill; or (2) acquiring, owning, or residing with any animal.  Any person who
violates these provisions would be guilty of a disorderly persons offense.  The
bill would be designated as Mooses Law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would direct the
court, upon the conviction of a person for a criminal animal cruelty offense,
to order the forfeiture of any animal owned by the offender and the transfer of
the animal to the custody of an animal shelter, unless the animal is co-owned
by a person who does not live with the offender and who has not been convicted
of an animal cruelty offense.  In that case, the animal is to be transferred to
the custody of the co-owner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would direct the
court to issue an order prohibiting the offender from acquiring, owning, or
residing with any animal for:  (1) a period of not less than two years
following the date of the offenders conviction for the offense, or following
the date of the offenders release from incarceration for the offense,
whichever is later; (2) the duration of the probationary period imposed by the
court for the offense, if that period will last for two years or longer; or (3)
any more extended period of time, which the court, in its discretion,
determines to be appropriate based on the nature and severity of the offense,
the offenders prior history of animal cruelty offenses, and any other relevant
factor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also direct the
court to order the offender to refrain from commencing, operating, applying for
employment or volunteering at, or participating in, an animal-related
enterprise for a period of time, which the court, in its discretion, determines
to be appropriate based on the nature and severity of the criminal animal
cruelty offense and the offenders prior history of animal cruelty offenses. 
The bill would allow the offender to petition the court to reduce the duration
of this order.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would amend N.J.S.2C:43-12,
which establishes a Statewide program of Pretrial Intervention, to provide that
there would be a presumption against admission into the program for defendants
charged with animal cruelty offenses. </p>
