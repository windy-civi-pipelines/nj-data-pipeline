For economic context, beer is the largest alcohol category sold in New Jersey, with over 67.3 million cases sold in 2021.   Beer sales accounted for 73 percent of the market share. The Jersey Craft Beverage Retailer Promotion and Grant Program would be designed to increase consumer awareness about State craft alcohol beverages, increase consumer awareness of retail consumption license holders, organize advertising campaigns, disseminate information about craft alcoholic beverages, and create a related signage program.  This bill would establish a promotion and grant program to accomplish these purposes.
