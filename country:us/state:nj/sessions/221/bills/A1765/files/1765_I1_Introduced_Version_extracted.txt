Any determination resulting from any preliminary or plenary hearing held pursuant to subsection [b.,] c.[,] or e. of this section shall not be admissible at any criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings on the alleged violation or violations. g.    In addition to any other requirements imposed by statute or regulation, as a condition for the restoration of a revoked or suspended license issued under the provisions of the "New Jersey Commercial Driver License Act," P.L.1990, c.103 (C.39:3-10.9 et seq.), the person whose commercial driving privileges are revoked or suspended shall successfully complete a commercial driver improvement program.  The [director] chief administrator, in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall promulgate rules and regulations prescribing the scope and content of the program, the qualifications of third parties that may offer a commercial driver improvement program, a fee schedule for persons attending a commercial driver improvement program and such other matters as the [director] chief administrator may deem appropriate and necessary.  The successful completion of a commercial driver improvement program pursuant to this subsection shall not entitle a person to any reduction in the points assessed and recorded under P.L.1982, c.43 (C.39:5-30.5 et seq.).  In addition, the [director] chief administrator may also require a person holding a commercial driver's license pursuant to P.L.1990, c.103 (C.39:3-10.9 et seq.) who receives 12 or more points during a 24-month period to complete a commercial driver improvement program successfully or face full suspension of the commercial driver's license driving privilege. (cf: P.L.2003, c.131, s.3) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month after enactment, but the chief administrator may take such anticipatory administrative action as necessary to implement the provisions of this act. STATEMENT This bill requires the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission to immediately suspend the drivers license of a person who has committed certain traffic violations which result in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. Under current law, the chief administrator is authorized to immediately issue a preliminary suspension of a drivers license for good cause and without hearing if the person allegedly committed any of the following violations:  (1) speeding in excess of 20 miles per hour over the speed limit; (2) drunk driving; (3) reckless driving; and (4) leaving the scene of an accident.  This bill would change this law to make it mandatory for the chief administrator to immediately suspend a persons license under these circumstances. The bill also expands the violations triggering an immediate drivers license suspension to include driving in violation of a condition of an examination permit, a special learners permit, or a provisional drivers license, including driving with more than the allowed number of passengers or driving during prohibited hours.
