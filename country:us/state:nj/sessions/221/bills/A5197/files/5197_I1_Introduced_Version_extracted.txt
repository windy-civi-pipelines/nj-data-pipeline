(2)   The Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control may issue one special license to an individual, corporation, or other type of legal entity to serve alcoholic beverages at an off-track wagering facility located in the municipality where a Class C plenary retail consumption licensee was not available to provide alcoholic beverages at the off-track wagering facility pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.  The license shall authorize the sale of alcoholic beverages for immediate consumption on the premises of the off-track wagering facility.  The director may issue not more than 15 licenses pursuant to this paragraph.  Furthermore, licenses issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the following requirements: (a)   No person who would fail to qualify as a licensee under Title 33 of the Revised Statutes shall be permitted to hold an interest in a special license under the provisions of this paragraph; (b)   Licenses shall be subject to the provisions of Title 33 of the Revised Statutes and rules and regulations promulgated by the director, to the extent those provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of this act; (c)   No license issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be transferred to any other premises; (d)   Application for the initial issuance and renewal of each license shall be made to the director on an annual basis.  The fee for the initial issuance of the license shall be the average sale price for the three most recent sales of plenary retail consumption licenses in the municipality where the license is being issued during the preceding five years.  If the off-track wagering facility is located within the boundaries of two or more municipalities, the highest average sale price of the two or more municipalities shall be used.  If less than three plenary retail consumption licenses have been sold in the municipality or municipalities, as the case may be, within the previous five years, the director shall obtain an appraisal, at the applicant's expense, to determine the appropriate fee for the license.  The appraisal process shall include an examination of previous transactions in the municipality or municipalities, as the case may be, and shall reflect what a willing buyer, under no pressure to buy, would pay a willing seller, under no pressure to sell, for a plenary retail consumption license in that municipality or municipalities, as the case may be.

(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to allow the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control to issue a special concessionaire permit or a special license described in paragraph (2) of this subsection to the authority pursuant to this act, P.L.2001, c.199, or to issue a special license to any individual, corporation, or other type of legal entity to serve alcoholic beverages in a municipality that prohibits the retail sale of alcoholic beverages within its boundaries. f.     Persons under the age of [18] 21 years shall not be permitted in any off-track wagering facility, except in dining areas if accompanied by a parent or guardian. g.    The commission shall by regulation establish minimum standards for off-track wagering facilities and timelines for their establishment and completion, including, but not limited to, standards for quality, size, seating capacity, the provision of first-class dining facilities, parking and services to be provided, as well as expected dates of construction, renovations and opening.  The failure of an off-track wagering licensee to meet these standards shall be sufficient cause for the commission to revoke, suspend or refuse to renew a license pursuant to the provisions of section 8 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-134). h.    Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, an off-track wagering facility shall be a permitted use in all commercial and industrial districts of a municipality. i.     In evaluating an application for an off-track wagering license, the commission shall consider the proximity of the applicant's proposed site to other planned or existing off-track wagering facilities and to racetracks in this State.  If, in the opinion of the commission, the establishment of the facility at its proposed location would be inimical to the interests of another planned or established off-track wagering facility, or to a State racetrack, the commission shall require the applicant to consider alternative sites for the proposed facility. (cf: P.L.2011, c.26, s.4) 3.    Section 16 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-142) is amended to read as follows: 16. a.

In evaluating an application for a license, the commission shall ensure that each selected applicant has met all required eligibility criteria.  In awarding the license, the commission shall also consider the proximity of the applicant's venue to planned or existing racetracks, off-track wagering facilities, and simulcasting facilities in this State.  If, in the opinion of the commission, the issuance of a license for the establishment of electronic wagering terminals at the applicant's venue would be inimical to the interests of a planned or established racetrack, off-track wagering facility, or simulcasting facility, the commission shall deny the license even when the applicant has otherwise met all eligibility criteria. A license issued under this section shall at all times remain the property of the permit holder and shall be subject to all conditions of a participation agreement pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-130), as amended and supplemented.  The permit holder shall be responsible for entering into agreements with qualified taverns, restaurants and similar venues.

Any temporary rulemaking authorized by this subsection shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the commission may deem appropriate.  Notice of any temporary rulemaking action taken by the commission pursuant to this subsection shall be published in the New Jersey Register, and provided to the newspapers designated by the commission pursuant to subsection d. of section 3 of P.L.1975, c.231 (C.10:4-8), at least seven days prior to the implementation of the temporary rules.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the publication of the text of any temporary rule adopted by the commission or notice of any modification of any temporary rulemaking initiated in accordance with this subsection. The text of any temporary rule adopted by the commission shall be available in each venue participating in the temporary rulemaking and shall be available upon request from the commission.  The temporary rules promulgated pursuant to this subsection shall not be effective for more than 180 days unless promulgated in accordance with normal rule-making procedures. e.     Within three years of the issuance of the license under the pilot program, the commission shall issue a report to the Governor, and to the Legislature as provided under section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), containing an evaluation of the pilot program.

In evaluating an application for a license, the commission shall ensure that each selected applicant has met all required eligibility criteria.  In awarding the license, the commission shall also consider the proximity of the applicant's venue to planned or existing racetracks, off-track wagering facilities, and simulcasting facilities in this State.  If, in the opinion of the commission, the issuance of a license for the establishment of electronic wagering terminals at the applicant's venue would be inimical to the interests of a planned or established racetrack, off-track wagering facility, or simulcasting facility, the commission shall deny the license even when the applicant has otherwise met all eligibility criteria. A license issued under this section shall at all times remain the property of the permit holder and shall be subject to all conditions of a participation agreement pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-130), as amended and supplemented.  The permit holder shall be responsible for entering into agreements with qualified taverns, restaurants and similar venues. The permit holder and qualified tavern, restaurant or similar venue shall jointly submit to the commission any applications and information as required by the commission in determining eligibility for a license.  The permit holder may terminate agreements for individual licenses with notice to the commission. c.     To effectuate the provisions of this act, P.L.2011, c.228 (C.5:5-186), the commission shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to: (1)   determine the number of locations at which electronic wagering terminals shall be established under the program, provided that the license shall be limited to a maximum of 12 locations, which maximum number of locations shall be reduced by one per each off-track wagering facility in the authority's share that is newly-established during the implementation of the pilot program, and provided further that not more than 20 electronic wagering terminals shall be established in total in this State; (2)   evaluate the types of electronic wagering terminals and equipment that may be used in wagering, and the number of such machines to be established at each licensed venue, subject to approval by the commission; (3)   develop geographic proximity and impact criteria to determine whether a proposed location would be inimical to the interest of planned or existing racetracks, off-track wagering facilities, and simulcasting facilities in this State, and which criteria shall be used to deny a license as provided under subsection b. of this section; (4)   authorize the licensee to enter into contracts with vendors, operators, and other entities, as the case may be, for the establishment and operation of the approved electronic wagering terminals; (5)   ensure that amounts wagered through the electronic wagering terminals are properly distributed to winning bettors, the licensed venue, and others in a manner similar to that provided under section 44 of P.L.1940, c.17 (C.5:5-64), section 21 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-147) for sums wagered on in-State races, and sections 22 through 25 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-148 through C.5:5-151) for sums wagered on out-of-State races, except that a local impact fee of 1% of the licensee's share of revenues shall be paid to the host municipality for general municipal purposes; (6)   provide that an amount of the revenues from electronic wagering terminals shall be distributed for the funding of horse racing purses in accordance with the statutes cited under paragraph (5) of this subsection; (7)   ensure that persons under the age of [18] 21 years shall not be permitted within the space in the venue where electronic wagering terminals are placed, and that necessary safeguards are in place to prevent minors from wagering; and (8)   regulate any other aspects of the electronic wagering operation the commission deems appropriate. d.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this act or the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the commission shall, within 90 days of the effective date of this act and after notice provided in accordance with this subsection, authorize the temporary adoption of any rule concerning the conduct of wagering under this act, P.L.2011, c.228 (C.5:5-186). Any temporary rulemaking authorized by this subsection shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the commission may deem appropriate.  Notice of any temporary rulemaking action taken by the commission pursuant to this subsection shall be published in the New Jersey Register, and provided to the newspapers designated by the commission pursuant to subsection d. of section 3 of P.L.1975, c.231 (C.10:4-8), at least seven days prior to the implementation of the temporary rules.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the publication of the text of any temporary rule adopted by the commission or notice of any modification of any temporary rulemaking initiated in accordance with this subsection. The text of any temporary rule adopted by the commission shall be available in each venue participating in the temporary rulemaking and shall be available upon request from the commission.  The temporary rules promulgated pursuant to this subsection shall not be effective for more than 180 days unless promulgated in accordance with normal rule-making procedures. e.     Within three years of the issuance of the license under the pilot program, the commission shall issue a report to the Governor, and to the Legislature as provided under section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), containing an evaluation of the pilot program. The report shall also provide the commission's opinion as to whether the pilot program should be continued and, if so, recommendations for further improvement and implementation.  The pilot program shall end upon the expiration of the license issued under the program unless the Legislature enacts a law to continue the program. (cf: P.L.2011, c.228, s.1) 6.    Section 8 of P.L.2021, c.193 (C.5:5-197) is amended to read as follows: 8. a. A person within this State shall not be permitted to open a fixed odds wagering account, or place a fixed odds wager through the fixed odds wagering system, except in accordance with federal law and this act, and through the fixed odds wagering licensee, and no entity, other than the fixed odds wagering licensee, shall accept a fixed odds wager from a person within this State.  A person may not place a fixed odds wager unless the person has established a fixed odds wagering account with the fixed odds wagering licensee and is physically present in New Jersey at the time of placing the account wager, except that persons physically present at a racetrack or off-track wagering facility may place a wager through a teller at a window without opening a fixed odds wagering account. To establish a fixed odds wagering account, a person shall be physically present in New Jersey at the time of establishing the wagering account, at least [18] 21 years of age, except that any person on the self-exclusion list established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2002, c.89 (C.5:5-65.1) shall be prohibited from establishing a fixed odds wagering account.  A resident of this State who has established an account with a fixed odds wagering licensee may place a fixed odds wager through the licensee while physically present in New Jersey, or while physically present in another jurisdiction if placing such a wager is not inconsistent with the law of that jurisdiction or with federal law.  The division shall develop protocols to accurately determine a person's location within the State to effectuate the provisions of this subsection. b.    The fixed odds wagering account shall be in the name of a natural person and may not be in the name of any beneficiary, custodian, joint trust, corporation, partnership, or other organization or entity. c.     A fixed odds wagering account may be established in person, by mail, telephone, or other electronic media, by a person completing an application form approved by the division. The form shall include the address of the principal residence of the prospective fixed odds wagering account holder and a statement that a false statement made in regard to an application may subject the applicant to prosecution.  The fixed odds wagering licensee shall verify the identification, residence, and age of the fixed odds wagering account holder using methods and technologies approved by the division. d.    The prospective fixed odds wagering account holder shall submit the completed application in person, by mail, telephone, or other electronic media, including the Internet and wireless devices, to the fixed odds wagering licensee or such other person or entity as may be approved by the division.  The fixed odds wagering licensee may accept or reject an application after receipt and review of the application and certification, or other proof, of age and residency for compliance with this act. e.     Any prospective fixed odds wagering account holder who provides false or misleading information on the application is subject to rejection of the application or cancellation of the fixed odds wagering account by the fixed odds wagering licensee without notice. f.     The fixed odds wagering licensee shall have the right to suspend or close any fixed odds wagering account at its discretion. g.    Any person not in good standing with the division shall not be entitled to maintain a fixed odds wagering account. h.    The address provided by the applicant in the application shall be deemed the proper address for the purposes of mailing checks, fixed odds wagering account withdrawals, notices, and other materials. i.     A fixed odds wagering account shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable. j.     The fixed odds wagering licensee may at any time declare the fixed odds wagering system closed for receiving any wagers on any race or closed for all fixed odds wagering. (cf: P.L.2021, c.193, s.8) 7.    (New section)  Any account opened for the purpose of wagering on horse races pursuant to any provision of law, rule, or regulation and held by an account holder who is under the age of 21 on the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be frozen and no wager shall be accepted from such account until such time as the account holder attains the age of 21. The account holder shall be entitled to a full refund of all monies held in the account as of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and shall receive such refund within 30 days of the effective date of P.L    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 8.    Section 15 of P.L.1970, c.13 (C.5:9-15) is amended to read as follows: 15.  No ticket or share shall be sold to any person under the age of [18] 21, but this  shall not be deemed to prohibit the purchase of a ticket or share for the  purpose of making a gift by a person [18] 21 years of age or older to a person less  than that age.  Any licensee who knowingly sells or offers to sell a lottery ticket or share to any person under the age of [18] 21 is a disorderly person. (cf: P.L.1970, c.13, s.15) 9.    This act shall take effect 90 days following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill raises the age to wager or horse racing in this State from 18 to 21 years of age.  Any person who is under the age of 21 and who, on the effective date of this bill, has an open account for purposes of wagering on horse races will receive a refund of all monies held in that account within 30 days.  The account will be frozen and no wagers will be accepted from an account held by any person until they reach the age of 21. The bill raises the age requirements to purchase a lottery ticket from 18 to 21 years of age. Current law requires that persons attain the age of 21 in order to participate in most other forms of gambling in this State, such as casino games and sports wagering.
