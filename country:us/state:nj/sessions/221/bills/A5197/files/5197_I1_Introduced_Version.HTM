of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control.  When a Class C plenary retail
consumption license or licensee is available in the municipality, the authority
shall not hold a license to provide alcoholic beverages at an off-track
wagering facility.  However, when a Class C plenary retail consumption licensee
or license is not available in the municipality, the Director of the Division
of Alcoholic Beverage Control shall issue a special concessionaire permit to
the authority for the provision of alcoholic beverages at the off-track
wagering facility and, if the off-track wagering license is held by an
off-track wagering licensee other than the authority, the director may issue a

(1) of this subsection.  The license shall authorize the sale of alcoholic
beverages for immediate consumption on the premises of the off-track wagering
facility.  The director may issue not more than 15 licenses pursuant to this
paragraph.  Furthermore, licenses issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be
subject to the following requirements:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   No person who would fail
to qualify as a licensee under Title 33 of the Revised Statutes shall be
permitted to hold an interest in a special license under the provisions of this

consumption licenses in the municipality where the license is being issued
during the preceding five years.  If the off-track wagering facility is located
within the boundaries of two or more municipalities, the highest average sale
price of the two or more municipalities shall be used.  If less than three
plenary retail consumption licenses have been sold in the municipality or

director shall obtain an appraisal, at the applicant's expense, to determine
the appropriate fee for the license.  The appraisal process shall include an
examination of previous transactions in the municipality or municipalities, as
the case may be, and shall reflect what a willing buyer, under no pressure to
buy, would pay a willing seller, under no pressure to sell, for a plenary
retail consumption license in that municipality or municipalities, as the case
may be. One half of the amount of the application fee for the initial issuance
of the license shall be paid upon the issuance of the license and the other
half of that amount shall be paid one year later.  The director shall establish
an annual fee for the license which shall not exceed the fee which may be
imposed by a municipality for a plenary retail consumption license pursuant to
R.S.33:1-12, a portion of which shall be paid by the director to the New Jersey
Racing Commission for the funding of horse breeding incentive programs;</p>

issuance of the license shall be distributed in the following manner:</p>

located and if the off-track wagering facility is located within the boundaries
of two or more municipalities, the fee shall be divided equally among those
municipalities;</p>

the director shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of
this paragraph.</p>

character, honesty, competency and integrity;</p>

all required eligibility criteria.  In awarding the license, the commission
shall also consider the proximity of the applicant's venue to planned or
existing racetracks, off-track wagering facilities, and simulcasting facilities
in this State.  If, in the opinion of the commission, the issuance of a license
for the establishment of electronic wagering terminals at the applicant's venue
would be inimical to the interests of a planned or established racetrack, off-track
wagering facility, or simulcasting facility, the commission shall deny the
license even when the applicant has otherwise met all eligibility criteria. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A license issued under this

shall be responsible for entering into agreements with qualified taverns,
restaurants and similar venues. The permit holder and qualified tavern,
restaurant or similar venue shall jointly submit to the commission any
applications and information as required by the commission in determining
eligibility for a license.  The permit holder may terminate agreements for
individual licenses with notice to the commission.</p>

locations at which electronic wagering terminals shall be established under the
program, provided that the license shall be limited to a maximum of 12
locations, which maximum number of locations shall be reduced by one per each
off-track wagering facility in the authority's share that is newly-established
during the implementation of the pilot program, and provided further that not
more than 20 electronic wagering terminals shall be established in total in
this State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   evaluate the types of
electronic wagering terminals and equipment that may be used in wagering, and
the number of such machines to be established at each licensed venue, subject
to approval by the commission;</p>

proximity and impact criteria to determine whether a proposed location would be
inimical to the interest of planned or existing racetracks, off-track wagering
facilities, and simulcasting facilities in this State, and which criteria shall
be used to deny a license as provided under subsection b. of this section; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   authorize the licensee
to enter into contracts with vendors, operators, and other entities, as the

provided under section 44 of P.L.1940, c.17 (C.5:5-64), section 21 of P.L.2001,
c.199 (C.5:5-147) for sums wagered on in-State races, and sections 22 through
25 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-148 through C.5:5-151) for sums wagered on
out-of-State races, except that a local impact fee of 1% of the licensee's
share of revenues shall be paid to the host municipality for general municipal
purposes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   provide that an amount
of the revenues from electronic wagering terminals shall be distributed for the
funding of horse racing purses in accordance with the statutes cited under
paragraph (5) of this subsection; </p>

within 90 days of the effective date of this act and after notice provided in
accordance with this subsection, authorize the temporary adoption of any rule
concerning the conduct of wagering under this act, P.L.2011, c.228 (C.5:5-186).
Any temporary rulemaking authorized by this subsection shall be subject to such
