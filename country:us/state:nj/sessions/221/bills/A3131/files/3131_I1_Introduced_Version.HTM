of a stormwater management basin located in a qualified watershed, as that term
is defined in section 1 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill), pursuant to a stormwater management basin adoption

be entitled to a credit as provided herein against the tax imposed pursuant to
section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), in an amount equal to 100 percent of

otherwise due pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  The order
of priority of application of a tax credit under this section and any other tax

apply for and obtain a certification from the stormwater management agency that
certifies that the taxpayer was a participating entity for the applicable
privilege period and that the stormwater management basin is located in a
qualified watershed.  The certification shall indicate the date when the
taxpayer became a participating entity, include a copy of the stormwater
management basin adoption agreement, and state, to the best of the stormwater
management agency's knowledge, that the materials, supplies, labor, or other
costs incurred by the taxpayer, or the funding provided by the taxpayer, have

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, to be known as the <span
class=HangingAnActChar>Adopt a Stormwater Management Basin Act,</span> would
permit a business entity or nonprofit organization (participating entity) to
adopt certain responsibilities related to a stormwater management basin by
entering into an agreement with a stormwater management agency.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>Specifically,
under the bill, a stormwater management agency would be authorized to enter
into a stormwater management basin adoption agreement with a participating
entity for the construction, improvement, operation, maintenance, or funding of
a stormwater management basin.  The agreement could only be entered into at no
cost to the stormwater management agency.  However, the stormwater management
agency would be authorized to provide the participating entity with such
materials, supplies, or services that the stormwater management agency deems
appropriate.  The stormwater management agency would also be authorized to
advertise and promote a stormwater management basin adoption program, and
provide for appropriate public recognition of a participating entity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>No stormwater
management basin adoption agreement would be permitted unless the participating
entity successfully demonstrates to the stormwater management agency that it is
capable of performing its responsibilities in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the agreement and with all State and federal laws, rules and
regulations pertaining to stormwater management.  The bill would also establish
the grounds and procedures for termination of a stormwater management basin
adoption agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>In addition, the
bill would authorize a stormwater management agency to advertise any stormwater
management basin adoption program established pursuant to this bill and to
provide for appropriate public recognition of a participating entity.  Specifically,
the stormwater management agency would be authorized to issue a certificate of
recognition to the participating entity, and would be further authorized to
allow for the erection of certain signs at the stormwater management basin. 
The erection of signs consistent with municipal ordinances would be subject to
certain conditions and in accordance with certain specifications, as set forth
by the stormwater management agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>The bill also
provides that a stormwater management agency would be protected from claims by
any person for injuries or damages that may be caused or sustained by any
participating entity, or any employee, agent, contractor, member, or volunteer
thereof, during the course of, or as a result of, any activity related to the
performance of a stormwater management basin adoption agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>While performing
responsibilities under a stormwater management basin adoption agreement entered
into in accordance with the bill, a participating entity and its employees,
agents, contractors, members, and volunteers would not be considered to be
public employees or State employees for the purposes of the New Jersey
Tort Claims Act, or otherwise be accorded any of the protections set forth
therein.  Furthermore, any stormwater management basin adoption agreement
entered into in accordance with this bill would not be subject to the
requirements and provisions of the &quot;Local Public Contracts Law.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>Finally, the bill
would provide a tax credit against the corporation business tax for a
participating entity that adopts a stormwater management basin located in a
qualified watershed.  Under the bill a qualified watershed means the
respective watersheds of Lake Hopatcong in Morris and Sussex counties, Budd
Lake in Morris County, Swartswood Lake in Sussex County, Greenwood Lake in
Passaic County, and Lake Musconetcong in Morris and Sussex Counties. 
Specifically, the tax credit would be equal to the amount of the participating
entitys certified expenditures incurred under a stormwater management basin
adoption agreement, provided, however, the credit could not exceed $1,000 or 50
percent of the taxpayers total tax liability under the corporation business
tax.  The bill also establishes procedures by which a taxpayer may apply for
the tax credit, including certain requirements related to the certification of
eligible expenditures.</p>
