In the case of a Type I school district or a Type II school district with a board of school estimate, notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.18A:24-11, N.J.S.18A:24-12, or any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, such bonds may be issued by the board of education or the governing body of the municipality comprised within the district without the approval of the board of school estimate or the adoption of a municipal ordinance as applicable.

STATEMENT This bill authorizes school districts and certain municipalities to issue bonds to finance costs relating to repairs to school facilities and other furnishings and equipment that were damaged due to a natural disaster for which a state of emergency is declared. Under the bill, the bonds may be issued without the approval of the voters of the district in the case of a Type II school district without a board of school estimate and without the approval of the board of school estimate or the adoption of a municipal ordinance as applicable in the case of a Type I or Type II school district with a board of school estimate. The bill requires that a district may only issue bonds if the repairs are deemed to be necessary in order to provide a thorough and efficient system of education and that the costs, or any portion of the costs, stemming from such repairs are eligible for reimbursement by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The issuance of bonds under the bill would be required to be approved by the board of education of the school district. The approval would be evidenced by the adoption of a resolution by the board of education in a public meeting upon an affirmative vote of two-thirds of its full membership certifying the support of the board for the issuance of the bonds, the total estimated cost of the damage caused by a natural disaster for which a state of emergency is declared, and the amount of money to be raised through the issuance of bonds.

The application will be reviewed by the commissioner on an expedited basis pursuant to a process to be established by the commissioner. The bill provides that the approval or disapproval of an application for a school facilities project would not be contingent upon the school facilities project being consistent or inconsistent with the school districts long-range facilities plan or upon the fact that the long-range facilities plan has not been amended to incorporate the school facilities project. Upon approval of an application submitted for a district seeking State debt service aid, the board of education would adopt a resolution approving the issuance of bonds.
