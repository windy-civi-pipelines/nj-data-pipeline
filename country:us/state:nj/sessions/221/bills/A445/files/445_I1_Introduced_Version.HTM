CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning smoking and amending P.L.2005, c.383. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 4 of P.L.2005, c.383 (C.26:3D-58) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a. Smoking is prohibited in an indoor public place or workplace, or within a distance of 20 feet from the exterior of any building which is an indoor public place or workplace, except as otherwise provided in this act. b.    Smoking is prohibited in any area of any building of, or on the grounds of, any public or nonpublic elementary or secondary school, regardless of whether the area is an indoor public place or is outdoors.

Currently, the "New Jersey Smoke-Free Air Act," P.L.2005, c.383 (C.26:3D-55 et seq.), prohibits smoking in an indoor public place or workplace that is not exempted under the law and in any area of any building of, or on the grounds of, a public or nonpublic elementary or secondary school.  The law does not prohibit smoking in any area outside of an indoor public place or workplace, nor does it specify a distance from any area outside of an indoor public place or workplace where smoking is prohibited.
