Upon receipt and review thereof during the tax credit term, the authority shall issue a certificate of compliance indicating the amount of tax credits that the business may apply against liability pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2004, c.65 (C.34:1B-115.3). Any reduction in the number of retained full-time jobs below the number prescribed under the terms of the project agreement shall proportionately reduce the amount of tax credits the business may apply against liability in that tax period and the credits that may no longer be applied for that tax period shall be forfeited. However, if in any tax period, the number of retained full-time jobs drops below the minimum number of retained full-time jobs indicated in the paragraph of subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.2004, c.65 (C.34:1B-115.3) pursuant to which the project agreement was executed such that the business would no longer be eligible to apply the credits for the number of years for which it was approved, then the authority shall reduce the amount of tax credits the business may apply against liability and the number of years in which the business may apply the tax credits. The grant shall be subject to recapture provisions pursuant to the project agreement. b.    Following the termination of the public health emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to Executive Order No. 103 of 2020, as extended, a business that has entered into an incentive agreement may elect, before December 31, 2023, to waive, for the period beginning on July 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2023, the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (1)   any full-time employee employed by the business shall spend at least 10 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility [through] for the 2023 tax period only; and (2)   following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for the 2022 tax period, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for the 2022 tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority. c.     For the 2024 tax period and all subsequent tax periods, a business may elect to waive for each tax period the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employees time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (1) to qualify as an eligible position or full-time job, the business shall demonstrate to the authoritys satisfaction that the employee spends at least 80 percent of the employees work time in this State and that the eligible position requires an employee to have the employees primary place of work in this State, which need not be at the qualified business facility for the business to receive the full award amount; (2) not less than 80 percent of the aggregate withholdings of new and retained full-time jobs at the business shall be subject to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., except for an employee who is a resident of another state and whose income is not subject to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., due to a reciprocity agreement with another state; and (3) following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for such tax period that an election is made, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of the tax credit the business receives for such tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority.

In no case shall the aggregate amount of the employment incentive grant awarded pursuant to a business employment incentive agreement entered into on or after July 1, 2003 exceed an average of $50,000 for all new employees over the term of the grant.

(3)   Upon the executive director's approval of an application for a tax credit transfer certificate, the division shall review and issue the tax credit transfer certificate. The tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by the business, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part, in an amount not less than $100,000, or the amount of the refundable tax credit issued if less than $100,000, of tax credits to any other person that may have a tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and 54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5.

The sale or assignment of any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate allowed under this section shall not be exchanged for consideration received by the business of less than 75 percent of the transferred credit amount before considering any further discounting to present value which shall be permitted. Any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate used by a purchaser or assignee against a tax liability shall be subject to the same privileges, limitations, and conditions that apply to the use of the credit by the business that originally applied for and was allowed the tax credit, including treating the amount of excess as an overpayment under subsection f. of this section. The tax credit transferee may not transfer its tax credit to any other party. h.    Following the termination of the public health emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to Executive Order No. 103 of 2020, as extended, a business that has entered into an incentive agreement may elect, before December 31, 2023, to waive, for the period beginning on July 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2023, the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (1) any full-time employee employed by the business shall spend at least 10 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility [through] for the 2023 tax period only; and (2) following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for the 2022 tax period, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for the 2022 tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority. i.     For the 2024 tax period and all subsequent tax periods, a business may elect to waive for each tax period the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employees time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (1)   to qualify as an eligible position or full-time job, the business must demonstrate to the authoritys satisfaction that the employee spends at least 80 percent of the employees work time in this State and that the eligible position requires an employee to have the employees primary place of work in this State, which need not be at the qualified business facility for the business to receive the full award amount; (2)   not less than 80 percent of the aggregate withholdings of new and retained full-time jobs at the business shall be subject to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., except for an employee who is a resident of another state and whose income is not subject to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., due to a reciprocity agreement with another state; and (3)   following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for such tax period that an election is made, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for such tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority. (cf: P.L.2022, c.134, s.2) 3.    Section 3 of P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-209) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  (1)  A business, upon application to and approval from the authority, shall be allowed a credit of 100 percent of its capital investment, made after the effective date of P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) but prior to its submission of documentation pursuant to subsection c. of this section, in a qualified business facility within an eligible municipality, pursuant to the restrictions and requirements of this section. To be eligible for any tax credits authorized under this section, a business shall demonstrate to the authority, at the time of application, that the State's financial support of the proposed capital investment in a qualified business facility will yield a net positive benefit to both the State and the eligible municipality. The value of all credits approved by the authority pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) shall not exceed $1,750,000,000, except as may be increased by the authority as set forth in paragraph (5) of subsection a. of section 35 of P.L.2009, c.90 (C.34:1B-209.3) and section 6 of P.L.2010, c.57 (C.34:1B-209.4). (2)   A business, other than a tenant eligible pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, shall make or acquire capital investments totaling not less than $50,000,000 in a qualified business facility, at which the business shall employ not fewer than 250 full-time employees to be eligible for a credit under this section. A business that acquires a qualified business facility shall also be deemed to have acquired the capital investment made or acquired by the seller. (3)   A business that is a tenant in a qualified business facility, the owner of which has made or acquired capital investments in the facility totaling not less than $50,000,000, shall occupy a leased area of the qualified business facility that represents at least $17,500,000 of the capital investment in the facility at which the tenant business and up to two other tenants in the qualified business facility shall employ not fewer than 250 full-time employees in the aggregate to be eligible for a credit under this section. The amount of capital investment in a facility that a leased area represents shall be equal to that percentage of the owner's total capital investment in the facility that the percentage of net leasable area leased by the tenant is of the total net leasable area of the qualified business facility. Capital investments made by a tenant shall be deemed to be included in the calculation of the capital investment made or acquired by the owner, but only to the extent necessary to meet the owner's minimum capital investment of $50,000,000. Capital investments made by a tenant and not allocated to meet the owner's minimum capital investment threshold of $50,000,000 shall be added to the amount of capital investment represented by the tenant's leased area in the qualified business facility. (4)   A business shall not be allowed tax credits under this section if the business participates in a business employment incentive agreement, pursuant to P.L.1996, c.26 (C.34:1B-124 et seq.), relating to the same capital and employees that qualify the business for this credit, or if the business receives assistance pursuant to P.L.1996, c.25 (C.34:1B-112 et seq.). A business that is allowed a tax credit under this section shall not be eligible for incentives authorized pursuant to P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.). A business shall not qualify for a tax credit under this section, based upon its capital investment and the employment of full-time employees, if that capital investment or employment was the basis for which a grant was provided to the business pursuant to the "InvestNJ Business Grant Program Act," P.L.2008, c.112 (C.34:1B-237 et seq.). (5)   Full-time employment for an accounting or a privilege period shall be determined as the average of the monthly full-time employment for the period. (6)   The capital investment of the owner of a qualified business facility is that percentage of the capital investment made or acquired by the owner of the building that the percentage of net leasable area of the qualified business facility not leased to tenants is of the total net leasable area of the qualified business facility. (7)   A business shall be allowed a tax credit of 100 percent of its capital investment, made after the effective date of P.L.2011, c.89 but prior to its submission of documentation pursuant to subsection c. of this section, in a qualified business facility that is part of a mixed use project, provided that (a) the qualified business facility represents at least $17,500,000 of the total capital investment in the mixed use project, (b) the business employs not fewer than 250 full-time employees in the qualified business facility, and (c) the total capital investment in the mixed use project of which the qualified business facility is a part is not less than $50,000,000. The allowance of credits under this paragraph shall be subject to the restrictions and requirements, to the extent that those are not inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph, set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this subsection, including, but not limited to, the requirement that the business shall demonstrate to the authority, at the time of application, that the State's financial support of the proposed capital investment in a qualified business facility will yield a net positive benefit to both the State and the eligible municipality. (8)   In determining whether a proposed capital investment will yield a net positive benefit, the authority shall not consider the transfer of an existing job from one location in the State to another location in the State as the creation of a new job, unless (a) the business proposes to transfer existing jobs to a municipality in the State as part of a consolidation of business operations from two or more other locations that are not in the same municipality whether in-State or out-of-State, or (b) the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, submits a certification to the authority indicating that the existing jobs are at risk of leaving the State and that the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, has reviewed the information submitted to the authority and that the representations contained therein are accurate, and the business intends to employ not fewer than 500 full-time employees in the qualified business facility. In the event that this certification by the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, is found to be willfully false, the authority may revoke any award of tax credits in their entirety, which revocation shall be in addition to any other criminal or civil penalties that the business and the officer may be subject to. When considering an application involving intra-State job transfers, the authority shall require the company to submit the following information as part of its application: a full economic analysis of all locations under consideration by the company; all lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the business's current in-State locations; and all lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the potential out-of-State location alternatives, to the extent they exist. Based on this information, and any other information deemed relevant by the authority, the authority shall independently verify and confirm, by way of making a factual finding by separate vote of the authority's board, the business's assertion that the jobs are actually at risk of leaving the State, before a business may be awarded any tax credits under this section. b.    (1)  If applications under this section have been received by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), then, to the extent that there remains sufficient financial authorization for the award of a tax credit, the authority is authorized to consider those applications and to make awards of tax credits to eligible applicants, provided that the authority shall take final action on those applications no later than December 31, 2013. (2)   A business shall apply for the credit under this section prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), and shall submit its documentation for approval of its credit amount no later than December 31, 2023. (3)   If a business has submitted an application under this section and that application has not been approved for any reason, the lack of approval shall not serve to prejudice in any way the consideration of a new application as may be submitted for the qualified business facility for the provision of incentives offered pursuant to the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.). (4)   Tax credits awarded pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) for applications submitted to and approved by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), shall be administered by the authority in the manner established prior to that date. (5)   With respect to an application received by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.) for a qualified business facility that is located on or adjacent to the campus of an acute care medical facility, (a) the minimum number of full-time employees required for eligibility under the program may be employed by any number of tenants or other occupants of the facility, in the aggregate, and the initial satisfaction of the requirement following completion of the project shall be deemed to satisfy the employment requirements of the program in all respects, and (b) if the capital investment in the facility exceeds $100,000,000, the determination of the net positive benefit yield shall be based on the benefits generated during a period of up to 30 years following the completion of the project, as determined by the authority. c.     (1)  The amount of credit allowed shall, except as otherwise provided, be equal to the capital investment made by the business, or the capital investment represented by the business's leased area, or area owned by the business as a condominium, and shall be taken over a 10-year period, at the rate of one-tenth of the total amount of the business's credit for each tax accounting or privilege period of the business, beginning with the tax period in which the business is first certified by the authority as having met the investment capital and employment qualifications, subject to any reduction or disqualification as provided by subsection d. of this section as determined by annual review by the authority. In conducting its annual review, the authority may require a business to submit any information determined by the authority to be necessary and relevant to its review. The credit amount that may be taken for a tax period of the business that exceeds the final liabilities of the business for the tax period may be carried forward for use by the business in the next 20 successive tax periods, and shall expire thereafter, provided that the value of all credits approved by the authority against tax liabilities pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) in any fiscal year shall not exceed $260,000,000. The amount of credit allowed for a tax period to a business that is a tenant in a qualified business facility shall not exceed the business's total lease payments for occupancy of the qualified business facility for the tax period. A business may elect to suspend its obligations for the 2020, 2021, 2022, or 2023 tax period, or any combination thereof, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, provided that the business shall make such election in writing to the authority before the issuance of the tax credit for the corresponding tax year and such suspension shall extend the term of the eligibility period by a corresponding amount of time. The authority shall modify the approval letter, and the business shall execute the modification within the time period provided by the authority. The modification shall provide that the failure to submit the annual report due to the suspension shall not be a forfeiture or an uncertified tax period. (2)   A business that is a partnership shall not be allowed a credit under this section directly, but the amount of credit of an owner of a business shall be determined by allocating to each owner of the partnership that proportion of the credit of the business that is equal to the owner of the partnership's share, whether or not distributed, of the total distributive income or gain of the partnership for its tax period ending within or at the end of the owner's tax period, or that proportion that is allocated by an agreement, if any, among the owners of the partnership that has been provided to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury by the time and accompanied by the additional information as the director may require.

(cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.12) 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides certain accommodations to businesses participating in the Business Employment Incentive Program, the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant Program, the Grow New Jersey Assistance Program, and the Urban Transit Hub Program for the 2024 tax period and subsequent tax periods. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) implemented certain accommodations for businesses that had previously been approved awards under these programs.  As part of these accommodations, the EDA waived the requirement that a full-time employee employed by a business participating in any of the programs is to spend at least 80 percent of the employees time at the qualified business facility to be eligible for an award under the program.  The New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020 lowered the requirement for spending time at the qualified business facility to 60 percent of the employees time, as provided by law. Due to the permanent impacts of COVID-19, starting in the 2024 tax period and for all subsequent tax periods, this bill allows businesses to waive the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business is to spend at least 60 percent of the employees time at the qualified business facility.  A business that makes such an election is required to satisfy the following criteria: (1) to qualify as an eligible position or full-time job, the business must demonstrate to the authoritys satisfaction that the employee spends at least 80 percent of the individuals work time in this State and that the eligible position requires an employee to have the employees primary place of work in this State, which need not be at the qualified business facility for the business to receive the full award amount; (2) not less than 80 percent of the aggregate withholdings of new and retained full-time jobs at the business are to be subject to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.; and (3) following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for such tax period that an election is made, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for such tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority. The bill also provides that a business that receives a tax credit award through the Emerge Program must demonstrate to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority that a full-time employee spends at least 80 percent of their work time in this State and that the eligible position requires an employee to have the employees primary place of work in this State, which need not be at the qualified business facility, for the business to receive the full tax credit award.

In no case shall the aggregate amount of the employment incentive grant awarded pursuant to a business employment incentive agreement entered into on or after July 1, 2003 exceed an average of $50,000 for all new employees over the term of the grant. The employment incentive shall be based on criteria developed by the authority after considering the following: (1)   The number of eligible positions to be created; (2)   The expected duration of those positions; (3)   The type of contribution the business can make to the long-term growth of the State's economy; (4)   The amount of other financial assistance the business will receive from the State for the project; (5)   The total dollar investment the business is making in the project; (6)   Whether the business is a designated industry; (7)   Impact of the business on State tax revenues; and (8)   Such other related factors determined by the authority. b.    A business may be eligible to be awarded a grant, either in cash or in tax credits, of up to 80 percent of the withholdings of the business or up to 50 percent of the estimated tax of the partners of an eligible partnership if the grant promotes smart growth and the goals, strategies, and policies of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-200), as determined by and based upon criteria promulgated by the authority following consultation with the Office of State Planning in the Department of State. c.     The term of the grant shall not exceed 10 years. d.    At the discretion of the authority, the grant may apply to new employees or partners in eligible positions created during the base years, and during the remainder of the term of the grant. e.     Within 180 days of the date of enactment of P.L.2015, c.194 (C.34:1B-137.1 et al.), a business that was approved for a grant prior to the enactment of P.L.2015, c.194 (C.34:1B-137.1 et al.), may direct the authority to convert the grant to a tax credit against the tax liability otherwise due pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and 54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5.

Capital investments made by a tenant and not allocated to meet the owner's minimum capital investment threshold of $50,000,000 shall be added to the amount of capital investment represented by the tenant's leased area in the qualified business facility. (4)   A business shall not be allowed tax credits under this section if the business participates in a business employment incentive agreement, pursuant to P.L.1996, c.26 (C.34:1B-124 et seq.), relating to the same capital and employees that qualify the business for this credit, or if the business receives assistance pursuant to P.L.1996, c.25 (C.34:1B-112 et seq.). A business that is allowed a tax credit under this section shall not be eligible for incentives authorized pursuant to P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.). A business shall not qualify for a tax credit under this section, based upon its capital investment and the employment of full-time employees, if that capital investment or employment was the basis for which a grant was provided to the business pursuant to the "InvestNJ Business Grant Program Act," P.L.2008, c.112 (C.34:1B-237 et seq.). (5)   Full-time employment for an accounting or a privilege period shall be determined as the average of the monthly full-time employment for the period. (6)   The capital investment of the owner of a qualified business facility is that percentage of the capital investment made or acquired by the owner of the building that the percentage of net leasable area of the qualified business facility not leased to tenants is of the total net leasable area of the qualified business facility. (7)   A business shall be allowed a tax credit of 100 percent of its capital investment, made after the effective date of P.L.2011, c.89 but prior to its submission of documentation pursuant to subsection c. of this section, in a qualified business facility that is part of a mixed use project, provided that (a) the qualified business facility represents at least $17,500,000 of the total capital investment in the mixed use project, (b) the business employs not fewer than 250 full-time employees in the qualified business facility, and (c) the total capital investment in the mixed use project of which the qualified business facility is a part is not less than $50,000,000. The allowance of credits under this paragraph shall be subject to the restrictions and requirements, to the extent that those are not inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph, set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this subsection, including, but not limited to, the requirement that the business shall demonstrate to the authority, at the time of application, that the State's financial support of the proposed capital investment in a qualified business facility will yield a net positive benefit to both the State and the eligible municipality. (8)   In determining whether a proposed capital investment will yield a net positive benefit, the authority shall not consider the transfer of an existing job from one location in the State to another location in the State as the creation of a new job, unless (a) the business proposes to transfer existing jobs to a municipality in the State as part of a consolidation of business operations from two or more other locations that are not in the same municipality whether in-State or out-of-State, or (b) the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, submits a certification to the authority indicating that the existing jobs are at risk of leaving the State and that the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, has reviewed the information submitted to the authority and that the representations contained therein are accurate, and the business intends to employ not fewer than 500 full-time employees in the qualified business facility. In the event that this certification by the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, is found to be willfully false, the authority may revoke any award of tax credits in their entirety, which revocation shall be in addition to any other criminal or civil penalties that the business and the officer may be subject to. When considering an application involving intra-State job transfers, the authority shall require the company to submit the following information as part of its application: a full economic analysis of all locations under consideration by the company; all lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the business's current in-State locations; and all lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the potential out-of-State location alternatives, to the extent they exist. Based on this information, and any other information deemed relevant by the authority, the authority shall independently verify and confirm, by way of making a factual finding by separate vote of the authority's board, the business's assertion that the jobs are actually at risk of leaving the State, before a business may be awarded any tax credits under this section. b.    (1)  If applications under this section have been received by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), then, to the extent that there remains sufficient financial authorization for the award of a tax credit, the authority is authorized to consider those applications and to make awards of tax credits to eligible applicants, provided that the authority shall take final action on those applications no later than December 31, 2013. (2)   A business shall apply for the credit under this section prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), and shall submit its documentation for approval of its credit amount no later than December 31, 2023. (3)   If a business has submitted an application under this section and that application has not been approved for any reason, the lack of approval shall not serve to prejudice in any way the consideration of a new application as may be submitted for the qualified business facility for the provision of incentives offered pursuant to the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.). (4)   Tax credits awarded pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) for applications submitted to and approved by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), shall be administered by the authority in the manner established prior to that date. (5)   With respect to an application received by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.) for a qualified business facility that is located on or adjacent to the campus of an acute care medical facility, (a) the minimum number of full-time employees required for eligibility under the program may be employed by any number of tenants or other occupants of the facility, in the aggregate, and the initial satisfaction of the requirement following completion of the project shall be deemed to satisfy the employment requirements of the program in all respects, and (b) if the capital investment in the facility exceeds $100,000,000, the determination of the net positive benefit yield shall be based on the benefits generated during a period of up to 30 years following the completion of the project, as determined by the authority. c.     (1)  The amount of credit allowed shall, except as otherwise provided, be equal to the capital investment made by the business, or the capital investment represented by the business's leased area, or area owned by the business as a condominium, and shall be taken over a 10-year period, at the rate of one-tenth of the total amount of the business's credit for each tax accounting or privilege period of the business, beginning with the tax period in which the business is first certified by the authority as having met the investment capital and employment qualifications, subject to any reduction or disqualification as provided by subsection d. of this section as determined by annual review by the authority. In conducting its annual review, the authority may require a business to submit any information determined by the authority to be necessary and relevant to its review. The credit amount that may be taken for a tax period of the business that exceeds the final liabilities of the business for the tax period may be carried forward for use by the business in the next 20 successive tax periods, and shall expire thereafter, provided that the value of all credits approved by the authority against tax liabilities pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) in any fiscal year shall not exceed $260,000,000. The amount of credit allowed for a tax period to a business that is a tenant in a qualified business facility shall not exceed the business's total lease payments for occupancy of the qualified business facility for the tax period. A business may elect to suspend its obligations for the 2020, 2021, 2022, or 2023 tax period, or any combination thereof, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, provided that the business shall make such election in writing to the authority before the issuance of the tax credit for the corresponding tax year and such suspension shall extend the term of the eligibility period by a corresponding amount of time. The authority shall modify the approval letter, and the business shall execute the modification within the time period provided by the authority. The modification shall provide that the failure to submit the annual report due to the suspension shall not be a forfeiture or an uncertified tax period. (2)   A business that is a partnership shall not be allowed a credit under this section directly, but the amount of credit of an owner of a business shall be determined by allocating to each owner of the partnership that proportion of the credit of the business that is equal to the owner of the partnership's share, whether or not distributed, of the total distributive income or gain of the partnership for its tax period ending within or at the end of the owner's tax period, or that proportion that is allocated by an agreement, if any, among the owners of the partnership that has been provided to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury by the time and accompanied by the additional information as the director may require. (3)   The amount of credit allowed may be applied against the tax liability otherwise due pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or pursuant to N.J.S.17B:23-5. d.    (1)  If, in any tax period, fewer than 200 full-time employees of the business at the qualified business facility are employed in new full-time positions, the amount of the credit otherwise determined pursuant to final calculation of the award of tax credits pursuant to subsection c. of this section shall be reduced by 20 percent for that tax period and each subsequent tax period until the first period for which documentation demonstrating the restoration of the 200 full-time employees employed in new full-time positions at the qualified business facility has been reviewed and approved by the authority, for which tax period and each subsequent tax period the full amount of the credit shall be allowed; provided, however, that for businesses applying before January 1, 2010, there shall be no reduction if a business relocates to an urban transit hub from another location or other locations in the same municipality. For the purposes of this paragraph, a "new full-time position" means a position created by the business at the qualified business facility that did not previously exist in this State. (2)   If, in any tax period, the business reduces the total number of full-time employees in its Statewide workforce by more than 20 percent from the number of full-time employees in its Statewide workforce in the last tax accounting or privilege period prior to the credit amount approval under subsection a. of this section, then the business shall forfeit its credit amount for that tax period and each subsequent tax period, until the first tax period for which documentation demonstrating the restoration of the business's Statewide workforce to the threshold levels required by this paragraph has been reviewed and approved by the authority, for which tax period and each subsequent tax period the full amount of the credit shall be allowed. (3)   If, in any tax period, (a) the number of full-time employees employed by the business at the qualified business facility located in an urban transit hub within an eligible municipality drops below 250, or (b) the number of full-time employees, who are not the subject of intra-State job transfers, pursuant to paragraph (8) of subsection a. of this section, employed by the business at any other business facility in the State, whether or not located in an urban transit hub within an eligible municipality, drops by more than 20 percent from the number of full-time employees in its workforce in the last tax accounting or privilege period prior to the credit amount approval under this section, then the business shall forfeit its credit amount for that tax period and each subsequent tax period, until the first tax period for which documentation demonstrating the restoration of the number of full-time employees employed by the business at the qualified business facility to 250 or an increase above the 20 percent reduction has been reviewed and approved by the authority, for which tax period and each subsequent tax period the full amount of the credit shall be allowed. (4)   (i)  If the qualified business facility is sold in whole or in part during the 10-year eligibility period, the new owner shall not acquire the capital investment of the seller and the seller shall forfeit all credits for the tax period in which the sale occurs and all subsequent tax periods; provided, however, that any credits of tenants shall remain unaffected. (ii)   If a tenant subleases its tenancy in whole or in part during the 10-year eligibility period, the new tenant shall not acquire the credit of the sublessor, and the sublessor tenant shall forfeit all credits for the tax period of its sublease and all subsequent tax periods. (5)   Following the termination of the public health emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to Executive Order No. 103 of 2020, as extended, a business that has entered into an incentive agreement may elect, before December 31, 2023, to waive, for the period beginning on July 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2023, the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (i)    any full-time employee employed by the business shall spend at least 10 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility [through] for the 2023 tax period only; and (ii)   following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for the 2022 tax period, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for the 2022 tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority. (6)   For the 2024 tax period and all subsequent tax periods, a business may elect to waive for each tax period the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employees time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (i) to qualify as an eligible position or full-time job, the business shall demonstrate to the authoritys satisfaction that the employee spends at least 80 percent of the employees work time in this State and that the eligible position requires an employee to have the employees primary place of work in this State, which need not be at the qualified business facility for the business to receive the full award amount; (ii) not less than 80 percent of the aggregate withholdings of new and retained full-time jobs at the business shall be subject to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., except for an employee who is a resident of another state and whose income is not subject to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., due to a reciprocity agreement with another state; and (iii) following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for such tax period that an election is made, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for such tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority. e.     (1)  The Executive Director of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, in consultation with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, shall adopt rules in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) as are necessary to implement P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.), including, but not limited to: examples of and the determination of capital investment; the enumeration of eligible municipalities; specific delineation of urban transit hubs; the determination of the limits, if any, on the expense or type of furnishings that may constitute capital improvements; the promulgation of procedures and forms necessary to apply for a credit, including the enumeration of the certification procedures and allocation of tax credits for different phases of a qualified business facility or mixed use project; and provisions for credit applicants to be charged an initial application fee, and ongoing service fees, to cover the administrative costs related to the credit. (2)   Through regulation, the authority shall establish standards based on the green building manual prepared by the Commissioner of Community Affairs, pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2007, c.132 (C.52:27D-130.6), regarding the use of renewable energy, energy-efficient technology, and non-renewable resources in order to reduce environmental degradation and encourage long-term cost reduction. f.     A business that has executed an approval letter may request before December 31, 2023 to terminate the award, commencing with the 2020 tax period or any subsequent tax period ending on or before December 31, 2023, due to the COVID-19 public health emergency; provided that the business shall submit a certification from the business's chief executive officer or equivalent officer stating that the termination is due, directly or indirectly, to the public health emergency and describing the impact of the public health emergency on the business.

A termination agreement executed by the authority and business shall not be amended. h.    A business that has entered into an incentive agreement may request, before December 31, 2023, to reduce the number of new or retained full-time jobs specified in the incentive agreement based on a certification of the business of the eligible positions at the qualified business facility commencing with the 2020 tax period and, at the discretion of the business, whether the reduction shall continue for each subsequent tax period remaining in the eligibility period, provided that the business maintains the minimum number of new or retained full-time jobs required to be eligible pursuant to subsection c. of section 3 of P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-244). The reduction in employment shall first apply to the number of new full-time employees, and then shall apply to the number of retained full-time employees. The authority shall calculate a new tax credit total amount for the 2020 tax period and the remainder of the eligibility period based on the reduced employment and shall amend the incentive agreement to reflect the recalculated award amount. In no event shall the modification result in an increase in employment or tax credit amount. i.     Following the termination of the public health emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to Executive Order No. 103 of 2020, as extended, a business that has entered into an incentive agreement may elect, before December 31, 2023, to waive, for the period beginning on July 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2023, the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (1)   any full-time employee employed by the business shall spend at least 10 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility through the 2023 tax period; and (2)   following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for the 2022 tax period, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for the 2022 tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority. j.     For the 2024 tax period and all subsequent tax periods, a business may elect to waive for each tax period the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employees time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (1) to qualify as an eligible position or full-time job, the business shall demonstrate to the authoritys satisfaction that the employee spends at least 80 percent of the employees work time in this State and that the eligible position requires an employee to have the employees primary place of work in this State, which need not be at the qualified business facility for the business to receive the full award amount; (2) not less than 80 percent of the aggregate withholdings of new and retained full-time jobs at the business shall be subject to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., except for an employee who is a resident of another state and whose income is not subject to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., due to a reciprocity agreement with another state; and (3) following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for such tax period that an election is made, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for such tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority. (cf: P.L.2022, c.134, s.4) 5.    Section 71 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-339) is amended to read as follows: 71.  a.  Beginning on the effective date of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.), but prior to March 1, 2029, to be eligible for tax credits under the program, a business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, shall demonstrate to the authority at the time of application that: (1)   the business will make, acquire, or lease a capital investment at the qualified business facility equal to or greater than the applicable amount set forth in subsection b. of this section;

(e)   in making the determination required pursuant to this paragraph, the authority shall not consider the value of any taxes exempted, abated, rebated, or retained under the "Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law," P.L.1991, c.441 (C.40A:21-1 et seq.), the "Long Term Tax Exemption Law," P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), the "New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zones Act," P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.), or any other law that has the effect of lowering or eliminating the business's State or local tax liability, and the business's chief executive officer or equivalent officer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that all documents submitted, and factual assertions made, to the authority to demonstrate that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State in accordance with this paragraph are true and accurate at the time of submission; (f)   If, during the term of the program, the methodology used by the authority in projecting benefits of a project in making the determination required pursuant to this paragraph is modified, the respective percentages by which the benefits must exceed the requested tax credit allocation amount set forth pursuant to this paragraph (5) may be adjusted to ensure consistent application of the respective thresholds in this paragraph (5) applied to each application; (6)   the qualified business facility shall be in compliance with minimum environmental and sustainability standards; (7)   the project shall comply with the authority's affirmative action requirements, adopted pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1979, c.303 (C.34:1B-5.4);

(cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.12) 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides certain accommodations to businesses participating in the Business Employment Incentive Program, the Business Retention and Relocation Assistance Grant Program, the Grow New Jersey Assistance Program, and the Urban Transit Hub Program for the 2024 tax period and subsequent tax periods. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) implemented certain accommodations for businesses that had previously been approved awards under these programs.  As part of these accommodations, the EDA waived the requirement that a full-time employee employed by a business participating in any of the programs is to spend at least 80 percent of the employees time at the qualified business facility to be eligible for an award under the program.  The New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020 lowered the requirement for spending time at the qualified business facility to 60 percent of the employees time, as provided by law. Due to the permanent impacts of COVID-19, starting in the 2024 tax period and for all subsequent tax periods, this bill allows businesses to waive the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business is to spend at least 60 percent of the employees time at the qualified business facility.  A business that makes such an election is required to satisfy the following criteria: (1) to qualify as an eligible position or full-time job, the business must demonstrate to the authoritys satisfaction that the employee spends at least 80 percent of the individuals work time in this State and that the eligible position requires an employee to have the employees primary place of work in this State, which need not be at the qualified business facility for the business to receive the full award amount; (2) not less than 80 percent of the aggregate withholdings of new and retained full-time jobs at the business are to be subject to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.; and (3) following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for such tax period that an election is made, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for such tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority. The bill also provides that a business that receives a tax credit award through the Emerge Program must demonstrate to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority that a full-time employee spends at least 80 percent of their work time in this State and that the eligible position requires an employee to have the employees primary place of work in this State, which need not be at the qualified business facility, for the business to receive the full tax credit award.
