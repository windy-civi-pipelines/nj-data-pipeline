Jersey Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.   For privilege
periods commencing on or after January 1, 2023 but before January 1, 2026, a
taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the corporation business tax imposed
pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), in an amount equal to 15
percent of qualified wages paid in the privilege period to a qualified disabled
veteran in the course of sustained employment.  Provided however, for a
privilege period the credit shall not be allowed in an amount exceeding $1,800
for each qualified disabled veteran.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The order of priority of
the application of the credit allowed pursuant to this section and any other
credits allowed against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945,
c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period shall be as prescribed by the
director.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The amount of the credit
applied pursuant to this section, added together with any other credit allowed
against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5),
shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax liability otherwise due and shall not
reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum provided
in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Unused credit resulting from
the limitations of this paragraph (1) may be carried forward, if necessary, for
use in the seven privilege periods following the privilege period for which the
credit is allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A taxpayer shall not be
granted a credit pursuant to this section for the qualified wages paid to a
qualified disabled veteran in a privilege period if the qualified wages of the
qualified disabled veteran or the job providing qualified wages to the
qualified disabled veteran is included in the calculation of another credit
against any State tax or grant for a period of time that coincides with the
applicable privilege period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If the director
determines that a taxpayer is displacing employees and replacing the employees
with qualified disabled veterans for the primary purposes of obtaining the
credit allowed pursuant to this section, the director shall deny the taxpayer
the credit allowed under this section and shall issue a tax assessment for the
recapture of credit previously allowed to the taxpayer under this section plus
an assessment of 50 percent of any credit subject to recapture as penalty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A taxpayer may apply to
the director for a tax credit transfer certificate in lieu of applying any
amount of the credit provided pursuant to this section against its tax
liability.  The tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by the
taxpayer from the director, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part, to any
other taxpayer that may have a tax liability under section 5 of
P.L.1945,&nbsp;c.162 (C.54:10A-5) in exchange for private financial
consideration to be provided by the purchaser or assignee to the taxpayer that
is eligible for the credit.  The certificate provided to the taxpayer shall
include a statement waiving the taxpayers right to claim that amount of the
credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162
(C.54:10A-5) that the taxpayer has elected to sell or assign.  The sale or
assignment of any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate allowed under
this section shall not be exchanged for consideration received by the taxpayer
of less than 75 percent of the transferred credit amount.  Any amount of a tax
credit transfer certificate used by a purchaser or assignee against a tax
liability under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) shall be subject to
the same limitations and conditions that apply to the use of a credit provided
by this section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    As used in this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualified disabled veteran
means a resident of this State initially hired by the taxpayer on or after the
date of enactment of this act who has been honorably discharged or released
under honorable circumstances from active service, occurring on or after
January 1, 1990, in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States and who
has been declared by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, or its
successor, to have a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or
greater. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualified wages mean any
salaries, wages and remuneration subject to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax
Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., paid to a qualified disabled veteran on or after
January 1, 2023 but before January 1, 2026, for labor rendered in service to an
enterprise of the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Sustained employment means a
period of time no less than 185 business days during the privilege period in

veteran.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A credit allowed
pursuant to this section shall not reduce the tax liability otherwise due
pursuant to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., for a
taxable year to less than zero.</p>

the limitations of this paragraph (1) may be carried forward if necessary to
the seven taxable years following the taxable year for which the credit was
allowed.  The form and method of carry forward shall be as prescribed by the
director. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A business entity that is
classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes shall not be
allowed a credit directly, but the amount of credit of a taxpayer in respect of
a distributive share of partnership income, shall be determined by allocating
to the taxpayer that proportion of the credit acquired by the partnership that
is equal to the taxpayer's share, whether or not distributed, of the total
distributive income or gain of the partnership for its taxable year ending
within or with the taxpayer's taxable year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A New Jersey S Corporation
shall not be allowed a credit directly under the gross income tax, but the
amount of credit of a taxpayer in respect of a pro rata share of S Corporation
income, shall be determined by allocating to the taxpayer that proportion of
the credit acquired by the New Jersey S Corporation that is equal to the
taxpayer's share, whether or not distributed, of the total pro rata share of S
Corporation income of the New Jersey S Corporation for its privilege period
ending within or with the taxpayer's taxable year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A taxpayer shall not be
granted a credit pursuant to this section for the qualified wages paid to a
qualified disabled veteran in a taxable year if the qualified wages of the
qualified disabled veteran or the job providing qualified wages to the
qualified disabled veteran is included in the calculation of another credit
against any State tax or grant for a period of time that coincides with the applicable
taxable year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If the director
determines that a taxpayer is displacing employees and replacing the employees
with qualified disabled veterans for the primary purposes of obtaining the
credit allowed pursuant to this section, the director shall deny the taxpayer
the credit allowed under this section and shall issue a tax assessment for the
recapture of credit previously allowed to the taxpayer under this section plus
an assessment of 50 percent of any credit subject to recapture as penalty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A taxpayer may apply to
the director for a tax credit transfer certificate in lieu of applying any
amount of the credit provided pursuant to this section against its tax
liability.  The tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by the
taxpayer from the director, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part, to any
other taxpayer that may have a tax liability under the New Jersey Gross Income
Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., in exchange for private financial
consideration to be provided by the purchaser or assignee to the taxpayer that
is eligible for the credit.  The certificate provided to the taxpayer shall
include a statement waiving the taxpayers right to claim that amount of the
credit against the tax imposed pursuant to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax
Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., that the taxpayer has elected to sell or assign. 
The sale or assignment of any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate
allowed under this section shall not be exchanged for consideration received by
the taxpayer of less than 75 percent of the transferred credit amount.  Any
amount of a tax credit transfer certificate used by a purchaser or assignee
against a tax liability under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act,
N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., shall be subject to the same limitations and conditions
that apply to the use of a credit provided by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this
section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    As used in this section:
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualified disabled veteran
means a resident of this State initially hired by the taxpayer on or after the
date of enactment of this act who has been honorably discharged or released
under honorable circumstances from active service, occurring on or after
January 1, 1990, in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States and who
has been declared by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, or its
successor, to have a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or
greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualified wages mean any
salaries, wages and remuneration subject to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax
Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., paid to a qualified disabled veteran on or after
January 1, 2023 but before January 1, 2026 for labor rendered in service to an
enterprise of the taxpayer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Sustained employment means a
period of time no less than 185 business days during the taxable year in which
a qualified disabled veteran is earning qualified wages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    This act shall take
effect immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes credits
under the corporation business tax and gross income tax for employers who employ
certain disabled veterans. The purpose of the bill is to encourage employers to
hire certain disabled veterans who are seeking employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides an employer
with a gross income tax or corporation business tax credit equal to 15 percent
of the wages paid to a qualified disabled veteran, up to a maximum of $1,800
per disabled veteran per taxable year or privilege period.  A qualified
disabled veteran is a resident of the State, initially hired by the employer on
or after the date of enactment, who has been honorably discharged or released
under honorable circumstances from active service, on or after January 1, 1990,
from any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States and who has been
determined by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to have a
service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or higher.  The VA uses a
scale ranging from 10 to 100 percent, in increments of 10 percent, depending on
the severity of the condition or illness to rate the extent of a veterans
disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The credits established by
this bill are temporary in that qualified wages are those wages paid by the
employer to a qualified disabled veteran on or after January 1, 2023, but
before January 1, 2026.  The qualified disabled veteran must be employed for a
least 185 business days of the tax year for which a credit is claimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill contains provisions
that prevent the potential for misuse of the tax credit.  A taxpayer may not
claim a credit established by this bill if the wages paid by that taxpayer to a
qualified disabled veteran are already included in the calculation of any State
tax credit or grant for the same tax year. If it is determined that a taxpayer
is displacing current employees and replacing them with qualified disabled
veterans for the primary purposes of utilizing a credit in this bill, the
credit will be denied, and if any credit was previously allowed, it would be
recaptured by the State and a penalty assessed against the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill contains certain
restrictions that prevent the corporation business tax credit provided by this
bill from being used in conjunction with any other corporation business tax
credit available to the taxpayer so as to exceed 50 percent of the tax
liability otherwise due, or to reduce the taxpayers corporation business tax
liability to an amount less than the minimum required by statute.  Similarly,
the gross income tax credit provided by this bill may not be used to reduce a
taxpayers liability to an amount less than zero.  Any unused credit resulting
from those restrictions may be carried forward over seven tax years by the
taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that a
taxpayer eligible for a credit under this bill may apply to the Director of the
Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury for a tax credit
transfer certificate, in lieu of applying the credit against its tax liability.
A tax credit transfer certificate may be sold or assigned to another taxpayer
who has a corporation business tax or gross income tax liability in exchange
for financial consideration of not less than 75 percent of the transferred
credit amount.</p>
