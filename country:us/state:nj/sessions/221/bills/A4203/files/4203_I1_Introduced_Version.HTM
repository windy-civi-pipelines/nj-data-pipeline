considerations in awarding alimony, and amending N.J.S.2A:34-23 of the New
Jersey Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. N.J.S.2A:34-23 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2A:34-23.   Alimony,
maintenance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Pending any matrimonial action
or action for dissolution of a civil union brought in this State or elsewhere,
or after judgment of divorce or dissolution or maintenance, whether obtained in
this State or elsewhere, the court may make such order as to the alimony or
maintenance of the parties, and also as to the care, custody, education and
maintenance of the children, or any of them, as the circumstances of the
parties and the nature of the case shall render fit, reasonable and just, and
require reasonable security for the due observance of such orders, including,
but not limited to, the creation of trusts or other security devices, to assure
payment of reasonably foreseeable medical and educational expenses.  Upon neglect
or refusal to give such reasonable security, as shall be required, or upon
default in complying with any such order, the court may award and issue process
for the immediate sequestration of the personal estate, and the rents and
profits of the real estate of the party so charged, and appoint a receiver
thereof, and cause such personal estate and the rents and profits of such real
estate, or so much thereof as shall be necessary, to be applied toward such
alimony and maintenance as to the said court shall from time to time seem
reasonable and just; or the performance of the said orders may be enforced by
other ways according to the practice of the court.  Orders so made may be
revised and altered by the court from time to time as circumstances may require.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The court may order one party
to pay a retainer on behalf of the other for expert and legal services when the
respective financial circumstances of the parties make the award reasonable and
just.  In considering an application, the court shall review the financial
capacity of each party to conduct the litigation and the criteria for award of
counsel fees that are then pertinent as set forth by court rule.  Whenever any
other application is made to a court which includes an application for pendente
lite or final award of counsel fees, the court shall determine the appropriate
award for counsel fees, if any, at the same time that a decision is rendered on
the other issue then before the court and shall consider the factors set forth
in the court rule on counsel fees, the financial circumstances of the parties,
and the good or bad faith of either party.  The court may not order a retainer
or counsel fee of a party convicted of an attempt or conspiracy to murder the
other party to be paid by the party who was the intended victim of the attempt
or conspiracy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     In determining the
amount to be paid by a parent for support of the child and the period during
which the duty of support is owed, the court in those cases not governed by
court rule shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Needs of the child;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Standard of living and
economic circumstances of each parent;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   All sources of income
and assets of each parent;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Earning ability of each
parent, including educational background, training, employment skills, work
experience, custodial responsibility for children including the cost of
providing child care and the length of time and cost of each parent to obtain
training or experience for appropriate employment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Need and capacity of the
child for education, including higher education;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Age and health of the
child and each parent;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Income, assets and
earning ability of the child;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   Responsibility of the
parents for the court-ordered support of others;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   Reasonable debts and
liabilities of each child and parent; <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(10) Health insurance
coverage available to the child through each parent, with an emphasis on
minimizing any disruption to the childs ongoing care and treatment; and</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>(10)<b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>(11)</u> Any other factors
the court may deem relevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The obligation to pay support
for a child who has not been emancipated by the court shall not terminate
solely on the basis of the childs age if the child suffers from a severe
mental or physical incapacity that causes the child to be financially dependent
on a parent.  The obligation to pay support for that child shall continue until
the court finds that the child is relieved of the incapacity or is no longer
financially dependent on the parent.  However, in assessing the financial
obligation of the parent, the court shall consider, in addition to the factors
enumerated in this section, the childs eligibility for public benefits and
services for people with disabilities and may make such orders, including an
order involving the creation of a trust, as are necessary to promote the
well-being of the child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this section severe
mental or physical incapacity shall not include a childs abuse of, or
addiction to, alcohol or controlled substances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In all actions brought
for divorce, dissolution of a civil union, divorce from bed and board, legal
separation from a partner in a civil union couple or nullity the court may
award one or more of the following types of alimony: open durational alimony;
rehabilitative alimony; limited duration alimony or reimbursement alimony to
either party.  In so doing the court shall consider, but not be limited to, the
following factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The actual need and
ability of the parties to pay;</p>
