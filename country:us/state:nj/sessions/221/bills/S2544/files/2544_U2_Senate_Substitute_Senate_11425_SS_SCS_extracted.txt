A conviction for a violation of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not be a prerequisite for a civil action brought pursuant to this subsection.  The civil action authorized by this subsection shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other civil action, injunctive relief, or other remedy available at law, including, but not limited to, a civil action for common law defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy, false light, misappropriation of identity, intrusion of privacy, or public disclosure of private facts. g.    (1) P.L.    , c.

(4)   This section shall not apply to any broadcasting station, including a cable or satellite television company, programmer, or producer, an Internet website, video streaming service, or a regularly published newspaper, magazine, or other periodical of general circulation, including an Internet or electronic publication, that routinely carries news and commentary of general interest, and that broadcasts or publishes any deceptive audio or visual media prohibited by this section solely for the purpose of disseminating newsworthy facts; provided that if the deceptive nature of the work is known or verified, the broadcast or publication shall clearly contain a disclaimer which is either shown or read aloud that identifies the work as a work of deceptive audio or visual media. (5)  It shall not be a violation of this section to disclose any deceptive audio or visual media to law enforcement officers in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution of a violation of this section; pursuant to a subpoena or court order requiring the disclosure of a work of deceptive audio or visual media; or in furtherance of an investigation concerning fraud, cybersecurity, identity theft, harassment, or a violation of a commercial computer networks contractual terms of service. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This floor substitute establishes criminal and civil penalties for the production or dissemination of deceptive audio or visual media, commonly known as deepfakes.  The floor substitute clarifies certain free speech exceptions applicable to interactive computer service providers, cloud services providers, commercial developers or providers of artificial intelligence technology, advertisers, the news media, and other media companies. Prohibitions The floor substitute establishes a crime of the third degree if a natural person, without license or privilege to do so, generates or creates, or causes to be generated or created, deceptive audio or visual media with the intent that it be used as part of a plan or course of conduct to commit any crime, including but not limited to: (1)  a crime or offense under chapters 14 (sexual offenses), 16 (bias crimes), 20 (theft), 21 (forgery and fraud), 28 (perjury), or 29 (obstruction of justice) of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes; (2)  advertising commercial sex abuse of a minor; (3)  endangering the welfare of children and child pornography; (4)  threats or improper influence in official and political matters; (5)  false public alarms; (6)  harassment; (7)  cyber-harassment; or (8)  hazing. The trier of fact may infer that a work of deceptive audio or visual media was generated or created without license or privilege to do so if the work was generated or created using a commercially or publicly available generative artificial intelligence system in violation of the terms of service, terms of use, or end user license agreement of the system. The floor substitute also establishes a crime of the third degree if a natural person, without license or privilege to do so, solicits, uses, or discloses a work of deceptive audio or visual media as part of a plan or course of conduct to commit any crime.

Civil Remedies Under the floor substitute, a person would be liable to the victim, as defined under the floor substitute, for a violation of the floor substitute, who may bring a civil action in the Superior Court.  The floor substitute further provides that a conviction is not a prerequisite for a civil action.  The civil action authorized by this floor substitute is to be in addition to, and not in lieu of any other civil action, injunctive relief, or other remedy available at law. Exceptions The floor substitute contains certain free speech exceptions if a deepfake is disclosed in connection with criticism, comment, satire, parody, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research that a reasonable viewer or listener would not believe to authentically depict speech or conduct.  Additionally, the floor substitute does not apply to interactive computer service providers, cloud services providers, or commercial developer or provider of artificial intelligence technology pursuant to 47 U.S.C. s.230. The floor substitute does not apply to television, cable, or radio stations, or other carriers of advertising, such as websites, billboards, newspapers, magazines, mobile apps, or streaming video platforms through which an advertisement containing deceptive audio or visual media appears, where the advertising channel or mediums role in disclosing the advertisement is limited to the selling of advertising time or space, or where an advertising channel or medium is prohibited by federal law from censoring the advertisement regardless of its content. The floor substitute does not apply to broadcasters, websites, newspapers, or magazines that routinely carry news and commentary of general interest that broadcast or publish a deepfake, provided that it is done solely for the purpose of disseminating newsworthy facts and contains a disclaimer identifying the deepfake.  Finally, the floor substitute does not apply to disclosures in connection with a law enforcement investigation or pursuant to court order, or in furtherance of an investigation concerning fraud, cybersecurity, identity theft, harassment, or a violation of a commercial computer networks contractual terms of service.
