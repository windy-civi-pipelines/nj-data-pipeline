<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.   There is created a
Public Employee Pension and Health Care Benefits Reform<span
class=HangingAnActChar> Task Force.  The purpose of the task force shall be to
make decisions on, and develop the terms, conditions, components, and
transition periods for those decisions made, as the task force determines to be
required to implement, the essential elements of the recommendations set forth
by the New Jersey Pension and Health Benefit Study Commission in the reports
issued on February 24, 2015 and on February 11, 2016, entitled,</span> <span
class=HangingAnActChar>A Roadmap to Resolution: Report of the New Jersey
Pension and Health Benefit Study Commission and Supplemental Report on Health
Benefits, respectively.  The task force shall develop the details for the
recommendations to such a comprehensive degree and level as to readily enable
the drafting of appropriate and necessary legislation to implement those
recommendations and the timely initiation of such executive and administrative
actions under authority of current law as may be appropriate and necessary to
implement the recommendations. If the task force deems it appropriate, the task
force shall submit in its final report a complete draft of proposed legislation
ready for introduction in the Legislature as it has decided is appropriate and
necessary for implementation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=HangingAnActChar>     Specifically,
the task force shall review, analyze, and make determinations on the issues
that need to be resolved in order to decide the terms, conditions, components,
and transition periods of the recommendations in the broad areas of pension and
health care benefits reform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=HangingAnActChar>     The
task force shall also, after making its determinations on the essential
elements of the recommendations, review, analyze, and make determinations on
the issues the commission sets forth as additional thoughts.  Particular
attention shall be given to the components of health care benefits plans and
programs set forth for consideration, and how those components should be
implemented by local government units and local boards of education for the
health care benefits plans and programs they provide to their public employees
and how the State can ensure that the components are implemented to the extent
feasible and practicable and that local government units and boards of
education have the resources to achieve comprehensive consideration and
implementation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=HangingAnActChar>     If
the task force determines that it is not feasible, practical, or cost-effective
to implement a recommendation or that an issue cannot be resolved, the task
force shall set forth in detail, in its report, each such recommendation or
issue, the analysis or calculations conducted, and its final determination on
each such recommendation or issue.  The task force shall also include in its
report the relevant factors considered during discussion, points of agreement
and disagreement concerning the recommendation or issue discussed, and the
reasons for any determination that an issue cannot be resolved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The task force shall
consist of seven members as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The State Treasurer who shall
serve ex officio, or a designee;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     One member, to be appointed by

a designee;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     One member, to be appointed by

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Vacancies in the membership of
the task force shall be filled in the same manner provided for the original
appointments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     All appointments to the

shall provide professional and clerical support to the task force, including,
to the extent practicable, assistance from actuaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The members shall serve
without compensation.  The three members recommended by the majority
representatives for collective negotiations purposes shall be reimbursed for
expenses incurred in the performance of their duties within the limits of funds
appropriated or made available for such a purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The task force shall hold at

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is one component of
a three-part package that is essential to ensuring New Jersey's long-term
fiscal viability.  The package will responsibly require a return to full
pension payments, cover a portion of the costs with health benefit reforms, and
create a task force to oversee implementation and resolve issues of detail. 
The viability and affordability of New Jerseys public pension and health
benefit systems are integral to the States overall fiscal condition and thus
bear strongly on other key areas of concern, from funding priorities, such as
school aid, hospital aid and safety-net programs, to controlling and reducing
property taxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill creates a Public
Employee Pension and Health Care Benefits Reform<span class=HangingAnActChar>
Task Force.  The purpose of the task force is to make decisions on, and develop
the terms, conditions, components, and transition periods for those decisions
made, as the task force determines to be required to implement, the essential
elements of the recommendations set forth by the New Jersey Pension and Health
Benefit Study Commission in the reports issued on February 24, 2015 and on February
11, 2016, entitled,</span> <span class=HangingAnActChar>A Roadmap to
Resolution: Report of the New Jersey Pension and Health Benefit Study
Commission and Supplemental Report on Health Benefits, respectively. The
task force is to develop the details for the recommendations to such a
comprehensive degree and level as to readily enable the drafting of appropriate
and necessary legislation to implement the recommendations and the timely
initiation of such executive and administrative actions under authority of
current law as may be appropriate and necessary to implement the
recommendations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=HangingAnActChar>     Specifically,
the task force is required to review, analyze, and make determinations on the
issues that need to be resolved in order to decide the terms, conditions,
components, and transition periods of the recommendations in the broad areas of
pensions and health care benefits reform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=HangingAnActChar>     The
task force will also, after making its determinations on the essential elements
of the recommendations, review, analyze, and make determinations on the issues
the commission set forth as additional thoughts.  Particular attention is to
be given to the components of health care benefits plans and programs set forth
for consideration and how those components should be implemented by local
government units and local boards of education for the health care benefits
plans and programs they provide to their public employees and how the State can
ensure that they are implemented to the extent feasible and practicable and
that local government units and boards of education have the resources to
achieve comprehensive consideration and implementation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=HangingAnActChar>     If
the task force determines that it is not feasible, practical, or cost-effective
to implement a recommendation or that an issue cannot be resolved, the task
force must set forth in detail, in its report, each such recommendation or
issue, the analysis or calculations conducted, and its final determination on
each such recommendation or issue.  The task force must also include in its
report the relevant factors considered during discussion, points of agreement
and disagreement concerning the recommendation or issue discussed, and the
reasons for any determination that an issue cannot be resolved.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The task force will consist of
seven members as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The State Treasurer who shall
serve ex officio, or a designee;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     One member, to be appointed by
the Governor, of the New Jersey Pension and Health Benefit Study Commission, or
a designee;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     One member, to be appointed by
the Governor, upon the recommendation of the majority representative for
collective negotiations purposes representing the greatest number of State
employees in this State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     One member, to be appointed by
the President of the Senate, upon the recommendation of the majority
representative for collective negotiations purposes representing the greatest
number of local employees in this State who are not local uniformed public
safety employees;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     One member, to be appointed by
the Speaker of the General Assembly, upon the recommendation of a majority
representative for collective negotiations purposes representing local
uniformed public safety employees in this State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     One member, to be appointed by

not later than the 30th day after the bills operative date, and the task force
is to hold its first meeting within 15 days after the appointment of a majority

as chairperson of the task force.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The task force will be
entitled to call to its assistance and avail itself of the services of the
employees of any State, county or municipal department, board, bureau,
commission or agency as it may require and as may be available to it for its
purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The task force is to issue an
interim report to the Governor and the Legislature within three months
following its first meeting, and issue its final report within seven months
following its first meeting.  The task force will remain active for one year
following the submittal of its final report so that it may consider and respond
to any written request submitted to it by a legislator or officer or employee
of the Executive Branch of State government on any issue, item, or decision set
forth in its report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill will take effect
immediately but shall remain inoperative until the approval by the voters of

amendment to the New Jersey Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>New Jerseys State-administered retirement systems are collectively in a
dire state of underfunding. There is no serious disagreement among policymakers
that regular State payments must be made in amounts as close as possible to the
actuarially required contribution until full payments can be made on a
sustained basis. The only significant disagreement is on which course of action
to take in funding those contributions: to do the responsible work of
identifying how to pay for them, or to simply create a constitutional mandate
to make the contributions without a credible plan to cover the cost.  Yet
history has shown that when State officials fail to plan for the costs they
incur, the taxpayers suffer the consequences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill <span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>is part of a comprehensive plan to take the
responsible approach.  This plan is to move health benefits for public
employees closer to those that most workers for large companies receive, and
mandate that the resulting savings go toward paying down New Jerseys pension
debt.  Retirement system changes will also ensure that pension system costs
will not again balloon unaffordably.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     Without
such changes to public employee benefits, it will be mathematically impossible
to make full pension payments in the short term except with extreme cuts in State
services or in priorities such as education aid, or raising taxes to a level
that would pummel the States taxpayers and stunt its economy.  The Pension and
Health Benefit Study Commission estimated that the amount of money needed would
equal raising the sales tax to 10 percent or increasing income taxes by 29
percent.  Anything close to those levels of taxation would be clearly
disastrous, wiping out jobs and pushing even more families out of the State.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     Those
who claim that full pension payments can be made without reforming benefits owe
it to the tax-paying public to be honest with them about how they, the
taxpayers, will pay the cost.  Responsible policymakers will show taxpayers
their plan in advance, rather than take the tragically common route of cementing
a huge fiscal obligation first, and only later sending them the bill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     Common
sense and mathematics make clear the need for benefit reform, but confirmation
also comes from the nonpolitical agencies that assess New Jerseys finances.  Moodys
Investors Service wrote in April 2015: Without meaningful structural changes
to the states budget, such as pension reform that dramatically improves
pension affordability, the state's structural imbalance will continue to grow,
and the state's [credit] rating will continue to fall.  S&amp;P Global wrote
in August 2015: A positive rating action or outlook revision would require the
implementation of credible pension reform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     The
package of which this measure is a part is designed to ensure the continuation
of retirement and health benefits for public employees in a fiscally
responsible manner that will protect all New Jersey residents from the
calamitous results of failure to properly address the States most serious and
pressing budgetary issues.</span></p>
