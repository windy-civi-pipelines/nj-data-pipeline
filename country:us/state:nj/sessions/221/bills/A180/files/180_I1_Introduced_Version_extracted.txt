The bill provides that a social media website that willfully provides free advertising for a candidate is to inform the candidate of that in-kind contribution.  Posts, content, material, and comments by candidates that are shown on the social media website in the same or similar way as other users posts, content, material, and comments are not to be considered free advertising. The bill provides that, upon finding a violation of the provisions of the bill by the Election Law Enforcement Commission, in addition to any remedies available pursuant to State law, the commission may assess against a social media website a penalty of $250,000 per day for a violation affecting a candidate for Statewide office and $25,000 per day for a violation affecting a candidate for other offices. This bill also creates a private right of action for users of a social media website, as those terms are defined in the bill, whose political or religious speech has been deleted or censored by the social media website or whose political or religious speech has been disfavored or censured by an algorithm used by the social media website. A user may be awarded certain damages provided in the bill. The bill provides that the prevailing party in a cause of action may be awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees. The bill provides that a court or jury is required to consider evidence that the owner or operator of a social media website restored from deletion or removed the censoring of a users speech in a reasonable time when determining damages sought by a user.  A court may not consider evidence of a users alleged hate speech on the social media website as a basis for justification or defense of the social media websites actions. The bill provides that the Attorney General may bring a civil cause of action on behalf of a user whose political or religious speech has been censored by a social media website under certain circumstances provided in the bill.
