<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would prohibit food
service businesses in the State from providing customers with access to
single-use plastic utensils or condiments, except in certain limited cases. 
Food service business is defined, by the bill, to mean a restaurant, café,
food truck, vendor station, cafeteria, or any other facility or premises, or
section or part thereof, including, but not limited to, a section or part of a
grocery store, convenience store, hospital, school, sports arena, entertainment
venue, or other similar facility or venue, where meals are prepared and served
to customers for immediate consumption thereby on or off the premises, whether
on a take-out, eat-in, drive-thru, or delivery basis.  Single-use plastic
utensils or condiments is further defined by the bill to mean those utensils or
condiment packets or packages which are composed of conventional plastics and
are designed to be discarded, by the consumer, after a single use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
provide that, commencing on its effective date (i.e., the first day of the
seventh month next following the date of the bills enactment):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   no food service business
operating in the State will be authorized to provide single-use plastic
utensils or condiments to any customer, except upon, and in accordance with,
the express request of that customer; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   a food service business
that has on-site seating capacity for 50 or more customers will be required to
provide its on-site customers with easy access to reusable, washable utensils
that may be used thereby while consuming meals on the premises, and which are
to be returned to the food service business, upon completion of the on-site
meal, for the purposes of cleaning and reuse.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any food service business that
elects to supply customers with single-use plastic utensils or condiments, upon
customer request, as authorized by the bill, would be additionally required to
provide each customer with only those types and amounts of single-use plastic
utensils and condiments that have been expressly requested by the customer.  A
food service business would also be prohibited from creating, acquiring, or
providing customers with bundled utensil or condiment packages that contain
more than one type of single-use plastic utensil or condiment, regardless of
the nature of any customer request therefor.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would specify that
nothing in its provisions may be deemed to:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   require a food service
business to provide any single-use plastic utensils or condiments to customers,
upon request, as authorized by the bill; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   in any way restrict a
food service business ability to provide its customers with eco-friendly
alternative utensils and condiments, either on an exclusive basis or
otherwise.  Pursuant to definitions established in the bill, eco-friendly
alternative utensils or condiments would include:  utensils and condiment
packets or packages which are composed of compostable material or another
material approved, by the department or the United States Environmental
Protection Agency, as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional plastics,
regardless of whether such utensils and condiment packages are designed to be
discarded, by the consumer, after a single use; utensils and condiment packets
or packages which are designed to be used multiple times and are not intended
to be discarded after a single use, regardless of whether such utensils and
condiment packages are composed of conventional plastics; and any other
utensils and condiment packets or packages that are approved, by the department
or the United States Environmental Protection Agency, as eco-friendly
alternatives to single-use plastic utensils or condiments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any food service business that
exclusively provides its customers with eco-friendly alternative utensils and
condiments would be fully exempt from compliance with the bills requirements. 
Any non-exempt food service business that violates the bills provisions would
be liable to a civil penalty of $1,000 for the first offense, $2,500 for the
second offense, and $5,000 for the third and each subsequent offense, to be
collected through a summary proceeding, and each day on which a violation
occurs would constitute a separate and distinct offense.  The bill would
specify, however, that no food service business will be subject to a penalty,
under the bill, if it acquires, possesses, or maintains on the premises, a
supply of single-use plastic utensils or condiments to provide to customers,
upon request, as authorized by bill.  Any moneys collected from penalties
imposed pursuant to the bill would be deposited into the Clean Communities
Program Fund for use in financing litter pickup, removal, education, and
enforcement programs at the State and local levels.</p>
