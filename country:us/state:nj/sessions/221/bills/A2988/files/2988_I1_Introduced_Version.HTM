A2988 ASSEMBLY, No. 2988 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  TENNILLE R. MCCOY District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Establishes task force to study issues and make recommendations regarding Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act establishing a Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf Task Force. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Schools for the deaf across the country have contributed to the education of students who are deaf and hard of hearing for nearly 200 years. b.    Many of these schools have undergone changes in recent years, including shifts in enrollment patterns, governance structure, and the scope of services provided.  Factors such as advances in technology, state-level fiscal constraints, and a continued need to maintain a visual learning environment for students who use sign language to communicate have led to new, innovative programs in many states that are both cost-effective and more academically rigorous. c.     Students who are deaf or hard of hearing continue to benefit from an educational environment where classmates, teachers, and staff members who use sign language to communicate are the norm, rather than the exception. d.    Language development is the key to learning, and opportunities for language development are maximized in an educational environment where all students can engage in rich conversations with peers, teachers, and administrators throughout the school day.  Schools for the deaf, where students and staff communicate through sign language, provide that crucial environment for students who are deaf or hard of hearing. e.     The Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf, with roots dating back to 1832, provides that necessary environment in New Jersey, offering comprehensive educational services for deaf and hard of hearing students from birth to age 21. f.     In recent years, the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf has faced several challenges, such as declining enrollment, rising costs for maintaining the schools buildings and grounds, overall fiscal issues, and instructional challenges.  These concerns warrant further study that includes taking a broad view of the school to determine how the State can best meet the educational needs of its students who are deaf and hard of hearing in an effective and fiscally responsible manner. 2.    a.  There is established a Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf Task Force.  The purpose of the task force is to study current issues concerning the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf, identify areas for improvement, and make recommendations to the Department of Education that will enable the school to achieve its goal of preparing students who are deaf or hard of hearing for a postsecondary education or career upon graduation. b.    The task force shall consist of the following 21 members: (1)   the Commissioner of Education, or a designee, who shall serve ex officio; (2)   the Director of the Department of Educations Office of Special Education Programs, or a designee; (3)   two members appointed by the President of the Senate, one of whom is a student who attends the Marie H.

Katzenbach School for the Deaf, to identify areas for improvement, and to make recommendations concerning the future direction of the Marie H.
