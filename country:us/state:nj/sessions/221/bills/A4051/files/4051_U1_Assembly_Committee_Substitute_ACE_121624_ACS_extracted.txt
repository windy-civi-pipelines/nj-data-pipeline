A4051 ACS ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE FOR ASSEMBLY, No. 4051 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE ADOPTED DECEMBER 16, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  SHAMA A. HAIDER District 37 (Bergen) Assemblywoman  LUANNE M. PETERPAUL District 11 (Monmouth) Assemblyman  WILLIAM B. SAMPSON, IV District 31 (Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblymen Clifton, McGuckin, Kanitra, Rodriguez, Assemblywomen Matsikoudis, Katz, Park, Dunn, Donlon, Swain, Assemblyman Kennedy, Assemblywoman Murphy, Assemblymen Hutchison, Miller, DiMaio, Assemblywomen Collazos-Gill, N.Munoz, Morales, Assemblyman Atkins, Assemblywomen Lopez, Hall, Ramirez, Reynolds-Jackson, Assemblymen Schaer, Danielsen, Barlas, Assemblywoman McCann Stamato, Assemblymen Calabrese, Stanley, Schnall, Tully, Assemblywoman Bagolie, Assemblyman Verrelli and Assemblywoman Kane SYNOPSIS Prohibits sale of cats, dogs, or rabbits by pet shops; repeals Pet Purchase Protection Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Substitute as adopted by the Assembly Commerce, Economic Development and Agriculture Committee. An Act concerning the sale of certain pets, supplementing Title 4 of the Revised Statutes, amending P.L.1941, c.151, and repealing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that it is an important public policy to protect animals and consumers from the well-documented puppy-mill-to-pet-store pipeline and support the adoption of homeless animals from animal rescue organizations, animal shelters, and pounds; and that consumers also have the option to buy puppies or kittens directly from responsible breeders who take excellent care of their animals and do not sell their puppies or kittens through third-party retailers. The Legislature also finds and declares that despite the consumer protections enacted by the State, some pet shops continue to obtain cats and dogs from kitten and puppy mills with egregious animal welfare records; that federal oversight of commercial breeders that sell cats and dogs to pet stores is minimal, and the federal standards established by federal regulations are limited, mere survival standards; that kitten and puppy mills sell sick and unsocialized pets, mislead consumers, and engage in predatory pricing practices; and that cats, dogs, and rabbits sold by pet shops are often abandoned or surrendered to animal rescues, shelters, or pounds. The Legislature furthermore finds and declares that shelters and animal rescue organizations buying kittens and puppies from commercial breeders inadvertently fund the mistreatment of cats and dogs by commercial breeders; and that shelters and animal rescue organizations across the nation can responsibly find homes for cats from kitten mills and dogs from puppy mills without financially compensating the commercial breeding industry that created the problem. The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the best interest of the citizens of the State to prohibit the sale of cats, dogs, and rabbits by pet shops, and to encourage pet shops to employ a humane and responsible business model which collaborates with animal rescue organizations, shelters, and pounds to showcase pets available for adoption.  The Legislature also determines that it is in the best interest of the citizens of the State to prohibit animal rescue organizations, shelters, and pounds from obtaining cats or dogs from breeders or brokers for payment or compensation. 2.    (New section) As used in sections 1 through 6 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): "Animal rescue organization" means the same as that term is  defined in section 1 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.1). Animal rescue organization facility means the same as that term is defined in  section 1 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.1).
