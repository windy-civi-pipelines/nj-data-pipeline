A rape kit submitted for analysis as required under the bill must include a signed certification as follows:  "This evidence is being submitted by (name of investigating law enforcement agency) in connection with a prior or current criminal investigation." Guidelines issued by the Attorney General currently govern the handling of rape kits in this State. Under these guidelines, rape kit evidence is held for 5 years within which a victim can decide whether to release the evidence to law enforcement.  The victim is informed of the county policy regarding time frames for the storage and possible destruction of evidence.
