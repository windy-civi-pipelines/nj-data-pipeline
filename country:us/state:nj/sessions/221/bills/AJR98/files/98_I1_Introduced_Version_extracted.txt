MCCOY District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Designates fourth week in April of each year as Every Kid Healthy Week. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution designating the fourth week in April of each year as Every Kid Healthy Week in New Jersey. Whereas, New Jerseys future depends on the health and vitality of its children, however, childhood health issues, such as obesity, food insecurity, and physical inactivity, threaten to limit this States bright future; and Whereas, For example, only 27 percent of New Jerseys children meet the recommended weekly level of physical activity, while over a third do not eat fruits and vegetables on a daily basis; and Whereas, Consequently, roughly 94,000 children in New Jersey between the ages of 10 and 17 are considered obese, and an estimated 82,000 high school students in this State are considered overweight; and Whereas, This childhood health crisis not only harms the physical and mental development of New Jerseys children, but also causes increasing obesity-related healthcare costs to be placed on this States taxpayers; and Whereas, Children who are considered obese or overweight are dramatically more likely to suffer from obesity as adults; and Whereas, Obesity in adults is highly correlated with physical health issues, such as cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, asthma, arthritis, hypertension, stroke, and various forms of cancer, as well as mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and chronic low self-esteem; and Whereas, These physical and mental illnesses, which are shown to negatively impact social relationships and work performance, directly undercut the ability of every child in New Jersey to achieve their life-long dreams and ambitions; and Whereas, Society also pays a high price for this obesity epidemic as public funds are increasingly used to cover rising obesity-related healthcare costs; and Whereas, Obese adults spent over 40 percent more on healthcare compared to healthy adults and place a disproportionate cost burden on Medicaid and Medicare, which together cover over half of the obesity-related medical spending in the nation; and Whereas, According to the New Jersey Department of Health, if the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, New Jerseys obesity-related health care spending could quadruple to $9.3 billion by 2018; and Whereas, Responding to this national crisis, Every Kid Healthy Week was launched as a part of the national movement to combat childhood obesity, promote healthy lifestyle choices for todays children, and celebrate school wellness achievements; and Whereas, This movement supports schools, parents, and health clubs to implement wellness initiatives that promote and reinforce healthy eating, physical activity, nutrition education and physical education in order to increase student achievement; and Whereas, By promoting lifestyle choices that are both healthy and practical, Every Kid Health Week not only brings attention to the obesity epidemic, but, more importantly, provides at-risk children with a pathway towards healthy living and life-long achievement; and Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper for New Jersey to annually observe Every Kid Healthy Week, so as to maximize the potential of every child in New Jersey and ensure the vitality of this great State in the decades to come; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The fourth week in April of each year is designated as Every Kid Healthy Week in the State of New Jersey to promote healthy lifestyle choices for the States youth and draw attention to the risks of childhood obesity. 2.    The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation designating the fourth week in April as Every Kid Healthy Week and shall call upon the public officials and citizens of this State to observe the week with appropriate activities and programs. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution designates the fourth week in April of each year as Every Kid Healthy Week in New Jersey in order to promote healthy lifestyles choices for New Jerseys children and draw attention to the risks of childhood obesity. New Jersey is no exception to the nation-wide obesity crisis. Roughly 94,000 New Jersey children between the ages of 10 and 17 are considered obese, and an estimated 82,000 high school students in the State are considered overweight.  Each of these children are at risk for developing a wide variety of physical and mental illnesses, such as heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and depression, all of which limit their ability to achieve life-long dreams and ambitions.  Moreover, the increased healthcare costs associated with obesity are directly thrust upon New Jerseys taxpayers, typically in the form of Medicaid and Medicare contributions. In response, Every Kid Healthy Week was established as a part of a national movement to help schools and parents promote healthy lifestyle choices for their children.  During this week, schools are encouraged to partner with parents and health clubs to help encourage kids to eat healthy and stay active.  By inspiring todays youth to live healthy, Every Kid Healthy Week will benefit every child and taxpayer in New Jersey.
