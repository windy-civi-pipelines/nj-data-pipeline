prohibited or limited by federal or State law, a health care provider who
establishes a proper provider-patient relationship with a patient may remotely
provide health care services to a patient through the use of telemedicine.  A
health care provider may also engage in telehealth as may be necessary to
support and facilitate the provision of health care services to patients. 
Nothing in P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.) shall be construed to allow a
provider to require a patient to use telemedicine or telehealth in lieu of
receiving services from an in-network provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Any health care provider
who uses telemedicine or engages in telehealth while providing health care services
to a patient, shall:  (1) be validly licensed, certified, <b><span

regulation by the appropriate New Jersey State licensing board or other New
Jersey State professional regulatory entity; (3) act in compliance with
existing requirements regarding the maintenance of liability insurance; and (4)
remain subject to New Jersey jurisdiction.</p>

technologies or, subject to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this
paragraph, asynchronous store-and-forward technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A health care provider
engaging in telemedicine or telehealth may use asynchronous store-and-forward
technology to provide services with or without the use of interactive,
real-time, two-way audio if, after accessing and reviewing the patient's
medical records, the provider determines that the provider is able to meet the
same standard of care as if the health care services were being provided in
person and informs the patient of this determination at the outset of the
telemedicine or telehealth encounter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   (a)  At the time the
patient requests health care services to be provided using telemedicine or
telehealth, the patient shall be clearly advised that the telemedicine or
telehealth encounter may be with a health care provider who is not a physician,
and that the patient may specifically request that the telemedicine or
telehealth encounter be scheduled with a physician.  If the patient requests
that the telemedicine or telehealth encounter be with a physician, the
encounter shall be scheduled with a physician.     (b) The identity,
professional credentials, and contact information of a health care provider
providing telemedicine or telehealth services shall be made available to the
patient at the time the patient schedules services to be provided using
telemedicine or telehealth, if available, or upon confirmation of the scheduled
telemedicine or telehealth encounter, and shall be made available to the
patient during and after the provision of services.  The contact information
shall enable the patient to contact the health care provider, or a substitute
health care provider authorized to act on behalf of the provider who provided
services, for at least 72 hours following the provision of services.  If the
health care provider is not a physician, and the patient requests that the
services be provided by a physician, the health care provider shall assist the
patient with scheduling a telemedicine or telehealth encounter with a
physician.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A health care provider
engaging in telemedicine or telehealth shall review the medical history and any
medical records provided by the patient.  For an initial encounter with the
patient, the provider shall review the patient's medical history and medical
records prior to initiating contact with the patient, as required pursuant to
paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-63).  In
the case of a subsequent telemedicine or telehealth encounter conducted
pursuant to an ongoing provider-patient relationship, the provider may review
the information prior to initiating contact with the patient or
contemporaneously with the telemedicine or telehealth encounter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Following the provision
of services using telemedicine or telehealth, the patient's medical information
shall be entered into the patient's medical record, whether the medical record
is a physical record, an electronic health record, or both, and, if so
requested to by the patient, forwarded directly to the patient's primary care
provider, health care provider of record or any other health care providers as
may be specified by the patient.  For patients without a primary care provider
or other health care provider of record, the health care provider engaging in
telemedicine or telehealth may advise the patient to contact a primary care
provider, and, upon request by the patient, shall assist the patient with
locating a primary care provider or other in-person medical assistance that, to
the extent possible, is located within reasonable proximity to the patient. 
The health care provider engaging in telemedicine or telehealth shall also
refer the patient to appropriate follow up care where necessary, including
making appropriate referrals for in-person care or emergency or complementary
care, if needed.  Consent may be oral, written, or digital in nature, provided
that the chosen method of consent is deemed appropriate under the standard of
care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1)  Any health care
provider providing health care services using telemedicine or telehealth shall
be subject to the same standard of care or practice standards as are applicable
to in-person settings.  If telemedicine or telehealth services would not be
consistent with this standard of care, the health care provider shall direct
the patient to seek in-person care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Diagnosis, treatment,
and consultation recommendations, including discussions regarding the risk and
benefits of the patient's treatment options, which are made through the use of
telemedicine or telehealth, including the issuance of a prescription based on a
telemedicine or telehealth encounter, shall be held to the same standard of
care or practice standards as are applicable to in-person settings.  Unless the
provider has established a proper provider-patient relationship with the
patient, a provider shall not issue a prescription to a patient based solely on
the responses provided in an online static questionnaire. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   In the event that a
mental health screener, screening service, or screening psychiatrist subject to
the provisions of P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.1 et seq.) determines that an
in-person psychiatric evaluation is necessary to meet standard of care
requirements, or in the event that a patient requests an in-person psychiatric
evaluation in lieu of a psychiatric evaluation performed using telemedicine or
telehealth, the mental health screener, screening service, or screening
psychiatrist may nevertheless perform a psychiatric evaluation using
telemedicine and telehealth if it is determined that the patient cannot be
scheduled for an in-person psychiatric evaluation within the next 24 hours. 
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a patient who receives
a psychiatric evaluation using telemedicine and telehealth as provided in this
paragraph from receiving a subsequent, in-person psychiatric evaluation in
connection with the same treatment event, provided that the subsequent
in-person psychiatric evaluation is necessary to meet standard of care
requirements for that patient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The prescription of
Schedule II controlled dangerous substances through the use of telemedicine or
telehealth shall be authorized only after an initial in-person examination of
the patient, as provided by regulation, and a subsequent in-person visit with
the patient shall be required every three months for the duration of time that
the patient is being prescribed the Schedule II controlled dangerous
substance.  However, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply, and the
in-person examination or review of a patient shall not be required, when a
health care provider is prescribing a stimulant which is a Schedule II controlled
dangerous substance for use by a minor patient under the age of 18, provided
that the health care provider is using interactive, real-time, two-way audio
and video technologies when treating the patient and the health care provider
has first obtained written consent for the waiver of these in-person
examination requirements from the minor patient's parent or guardian.</p>

shall comply with all applicable State and federal statutes and regulations for
recordkeeping, confidentiality, and disclosure of the patient's medical record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    A health care provider

registration of health care providers in the State, shall each adopt rules and
regulations that are applicable to the health care providers under their respective
