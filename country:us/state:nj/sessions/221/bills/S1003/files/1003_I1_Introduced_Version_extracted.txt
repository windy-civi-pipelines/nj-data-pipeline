GREENSTEIN District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Supplemental appropriation of $25 million to DOH to assist certain mental health and addiction service providers transitioning to fee-for-service reimbursement system. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Supplement to the annual appropriations act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, P.L.2021, c.133. Be It Enacted by the Senate and the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    In addition to the amounts appropriated under P.L.2021, c.133, the annual appropriations act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, there is appropriated from the General Fund the following amount for the purpose specified: 45 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH 20 Physical and Mental Health 23 Mental Health and Addiction Services GRANTS-IN-AID 13-4290  Community Services .......................................... $25,000,000 Total Grants-in-Aid appropriation, Mental Health and Addiction Services ......... $25,000,000 Grants-in-Aid: 13    Behavioral Health Rate Increase........ ($25,000,000) Of the amounts hereinabove appropriated for Behavioral Health Rate Increase, $25,000,000 is appropriated to provide supplemental reimbursements to licensed providers of mental health and substance use disorder treatment services who held cost-based reimbursement contracts with the State, and who subsequently transitioned to the fee-for-service reimbursement system.  Each supplemental reimbursement shall be equal to the difference, if any, between a providers billable revenues under the fee-for-service reimbursement system during FY 2022 and the value of the providers most recent annual cost-based reimbursement contract with the State.  Only providers who have demonstrated a good faith effort to bill Medicaid for all eligible services shall be entitled for a supplemental reimbursement. The appropriated funds shall consist of any unspent funds appropriated to mental health and substance use treatment programs within the Department of Health and the Department of Human Services, with additional amounts, as necessary, to be appropriated from the General Fund, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill makes a supplemental appropriation for fiscal year 2022 of $25 million to the Department of Health to assist certain mental health and addiction service providers who are transitioning to the fee-for-service reimbursement system. Specifically, the bill authorizes the department to distribute supplemental reimbursements to providers who held cost-based reimbursement contracts with the State, and who subsequently transitioned to the fee-for-service reimbursement system, equal to the difference, if any, between the providers billable revenues under the fee-for-service reimbursement system during FY 2022 and the value of the providers most recent annual cost-based reimbursement contract with the State. Only providers who have demonstrated a good faith effort to bill Medicaid for all eligible services shall be entitled for a supplemental reimbursement. The appropriated funds are to consist of any unspent funds appropriated to mental health and substance use treatment programs within the Department of Health and the Department of Human Services, with additional amounts, as necessary, to be appropriated from the General Fund, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury. During fiscal year 2017, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services began transitioning mental health and addictions services purchased under contract to a fee-for-service reimbursement structure.  While the department anticipates that the fee-for-service system will result in more cost-efficiency and improved health outcomes for clients, some providers have warned that the transition will be detrimental to their financial stability, and may force them to curtail services or close down. It is the sponsors intent to establish a financial safety net for those providers that lose reimbursement funds during this transition in order to ensure continuity of care for current service consumers.
