delivered, issued, executed, or renewed in this State, or approved for issuance

multitablet regimen, consistent with clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed
scientific and medical literature, is clinically equally to, or more effective
than, the single tablet drug regimen, and more likely to result in patient
adherence, coverage shall be required for the multitablet regimen, provided the
peer review of the literature has been performed by a health care provider with
experience in treating infectious diseases.  </p>
