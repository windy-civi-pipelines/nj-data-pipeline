WIMBERLY District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) SYNOPSIS J.B.s Law; amends Rules of Evidence to exclude creative or artistic expression in audio or video format from jury consideration in criminal proceedings. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution pursuant to P.L.1960, c.52 proposing an amendment to the Rules of Evidence and designated as J.B.s Law. Whereas, As early as 2011, lyrics of rap music, as expressed in audio and music videos, have been used as a basis for indictment and prosecution of rap artists, specifically hip-hop and rap artists; and Whereas, Edgar Jamal Gamory, whose stage name was J.B., is a contemporary example of an artist who has been convicted based in part on evidence from his creative and artistic expressions, specifically music lyrics and rap videos; and Whereas, The admission of creative or artistic expressions as evidence in a criminal proceeding in the form of musical lyrics and musical videos is unfairly prejudicial and is further contrary to the Confrontation Clause, Article I, paragraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution; and Whereas, Musical expression is a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment and should not be admissible into evidence or used as impeachment evidence in any criminal; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Pursuant to section 38 of P.L.1960, c.52 (C.2A:84A-38), the Supreme Court of New Jersey may adopt the rules specified in this section in the form set out, at any time after this joint resolution has been delivered to and signed by the Governor of the State of New Jersey, by entering an order that the rules are adopted and by causing true copies of its order of adoption to be delivered to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the General Assembly and the Governor, without again presenting the subject matter and a tentative draft of rules at a Judicial Conference. Rule 401 is amended to read as follows: N.J.R.E. 401.  Definition of Relevant Evidence "Relevant evidence" means evidence having a tendency in reason to prove or disprove any fact of consequence to the determination of the action.  Relevant evidence shall not include evidence of a defendant's creative or artistic expression, whether original or derivative, in audio or video format, and shall not be received into evidence, or used as impeachment evidence against the defendant in a criminal proceeding.

Evidence of the character of a witness as provided in Rule 608. (b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. (1) Prohibited Uses. Except as otherwise provided by Rule 608(b), evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove a person's disposition in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in conformity with such disposition. (2) Permitted Uses. This evidence may be admitted for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident when such matters are relevant to a material issue in dispute. (3) Evidence of a defendant's creative or artistic expression, whether original or derivative, in audio or video format, shall not be received into evidence against the defendant in a criminal proceeding.  Creative or artistic expression means the expression or application of creativity or imagination in the production or arrangement of forms, sounds, words, movements, or symbols including, but not limited to, dance, performance art, visual art, poetry, literature, film, and other such objects or media. (c) Character and Character Trait in Issue. Evidence of a person's character or character trait is admissible when that character or trait is an element of a claim or defense. Rule 801 is amended to read as follows: N.J.R.E. 801. Definitions (a) Statement. "Statement" means a person's oral assertion, written assertion, or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion.  A creative or artistic expression shall not constitute a statement, whether original or duplicate, in audio or video format.  A creative or artistic expression shall not be received into evidence or used as impeachment evidence against a defendant in a criminal proceeding. Creative or artistic expression means the expression or application of creativity or imagination in the production or arrangement of forms, sounds, words, movements or symbols including, but not limited to, music, dance, performance art, visual art, poetry, literature, film, and other such objects or media. (b) Declarant. "Declarant" means the person who made the statement. (c) Hearsay. "Hearsay" means a statement that: (1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. (d) Business. A "business" includes every kind of business, institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling, whether or not conducted for profit, and also includes activities of governmental agencies. (e) Writing. A "writing" consists of letters, words, numbers, data compilations, pictures, drawings, photographs, symbols, sounds, or combinations thereof or their equivalent, set down or recorded by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, magnetic impulse, mechanical or electronic recording, or by any other means, and preserved in a perceptible form, and their duplicates as defined by Rule 1001(d).  A writing shall not constitute a creative or artistic expression, whether original or derivative, in audio or video format.

(f) Public Official.

STATEMENT This joint resolution would amend the New Jersey Rules of Evidence to provide that evidence of a defendant's creative or artistic expression, whether original or derivative, in audio or video format, is not to be received into evidence against the defendant in a criminal proceeding.  Artistic expression evidence, especially when of a graphic, violent, or disturbing nature can be inflammatory and prejudicial to a defendant while having little value in establishing evidence of motive or intent.  Moreover, permitting the introduction of this evidence in a criminal proceeding can have a chilling effect on an entire genre of music. N.J.R.E.401, N.J.R.E.404(b), and N.J.R.E801(a) and (e) are substantive rules of evidence and it is the sponsors view that this resolution, by removing from jury consideration evidence of a defendants creative or artistic expression, the prosecution for a criminal offense is redirected towards more compelling evidence. This bill is named J.B.s Law to highlight a 2011 instance in which a federal appeals court acknowledged the erroneous admission into evidence of a rap video at trial on the grounds that it was prejudicial, and not probative of guilt.
