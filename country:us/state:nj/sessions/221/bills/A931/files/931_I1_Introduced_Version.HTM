Under the bill, a person under the age of 21 would be allowed to possess a handgun, rifle, or shot gun under the following circumstances: (1)   in the actual presence or under the direct supervision of a parent or guardian, or some other person who holds a permit to carry a handgun or a firearms purchaser identification card; (2)   for the purpose of military drill under the auspices of a legally recognized military organization and under competent supervision; (3)   for the purpose of competition, target practice, instruction, and training in and upon a firing range approved by the governing body of the municipality in which the range is located or the National Rifle Association and which is under competent supervision at the time of such supervision or target practice or instruction and training at any location; or (4)   for the purpose of hunting during the regularly designated hunting season, provided that the person possesses a valid hunting license and has successfully completed a hunter's safety course taught by a qualified instructor or conservation officer and possesses a certificate indicating the successful completion of such a course. The bill permits active duty military or a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard of this State to obtain a firearms purchaser identification card while under the age of 21. The bill preserves current law allowing minors to obtain a youth hunting license and apprentice firearm hunting license.   Persons between the ages of 18 and 21 who obtained a firearms purchaser identification card prior to the bills effective date would also be permitted to maintain the card and continue to purchase and possess shotguns and rifles.

STATEMENT This bill increases from 18 to 21 the age at which a person is eligible to receive a firearms purchaser identification card used to purchase shotguns and rifles.  Under current law, a person 18 years of age and older may obtain a firearms purchaser identification card and a handgun purchaser is required to be at least 21 years old. Under the bill, a person under the age of 21 would be allowed to possess a handgun, rifle, or shot gun under the following circumstances: (1)   in the actual presence or under the direct supervision of a parent or guardian, or some other person who holds a permit to carry a handgun or a firearms purchaser identification card; (2)   for the purpose of military drill under the auspices of a legally recognized military organization and under competent supervision; (3)   for the purpose of competition, target practice, instruction, and training in and upon a firing range approved by the governing body of the municipality in which the range is located or the National Rifle Association and which is under competent supervision at the time of such supervision or target practice or instruction and training at any location; or (4)   for the purpose of hunting during the regularly designated hunting season, provided that the person possesses a valid hunting license and has successfully completed a hunter's safety course taught by a qualified instructor or conservation officer and possesses a certificate indicating the successful completion of such a course. The bill permits active duty military or a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard of this State to obtain a firearms purchaser identification card while under the age of 21. The bill preserves current law allowing minors to obtain a youth hunting license and apprentice firearm hunting license.   Persons between the ages of 18 and 21 who obtained a firearms purchaser identification card prior to the bills effective date would also be permitted to maintain the card and continue to purchase and possess shotguns and rifles.
