<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span>
concerning the accommodation and relocation of certain public utility and cable
television facilities for the purposes of infrastructure projects,
supplementing Title 27 of the Revised Statutes, and repealing section 1 of
P.L.1983, c.283.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  The Legislature
finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   infrastructure projects,
such as highways projects, transportation projects, or other types of projects
in the public rights-of-way, are vital to maintaining the quality of life the
citizens of this State enjoy and to ensuring the health, safety, and welfare of
its residents;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   very often these
infrastructure projects can not be undertaken without impact costs resulting
from ancillary accommodation work and the relocation of public utility and
cable television facilities located in project areas, and along roads and highways,
and in the public rights-of-way;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   public utilities and
cable television companies doing business in the State of New Jersey have been
granted a privilege to occupy the public rights-of-way and to occupy areas
along the States roads and highways as public utilities and cable television
companies provide vital public services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   current law authorizes
the Commissioner of Transportation to include the costs associated with any
ancillary accommodation work or cost of the relocation of public utility and
cable television facilities in the overall cost of highway projects, thereby
requiring taxpayers and citizens of this State to fund these costs;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   in addition, other costs
are also passed on to the taxpayers as a result of the existence of facilities
during the planning and design phase, the bidding phase, and the construction
phase of infrastructure projects; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   in many instances,
public utilities and cable television companies delay the relocation of their
facilities, thereby increasing the costs of infrastructure projects and denying
taxpayers the use of infrastructure projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Legislature
therefore determines that, in any infrastructure project undertaken by a State,
county, or municipal contracting entity and financed with public funds, wherein
the existence of public utility or cable television facilities will cause
ancillary accommodation work or relocation of public utility or cable
television facilities, the cost of the accommodation or relocation shall be
borne by that public utility or cable television company and shall not be
passed along to the taxpayers of this State.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:
always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in P.L.    ,
c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Ancillary accommodation work
means any work caused by, or resulting from, the existence of a public utility
or cable television facility within any project area, including but, not
limited to, a public right-of-way in the course of the design or performance of
any infrastructure project.  Ancillary accommodation work shall include, but
not be limited to, any work associated with any interference with the
construction, loss of production, relocation, installation, support, or
protection in place, or removal of public utility or cable television company
facilities within a project area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     </b>Cable television
company shall have the same meaning as provided in section 3 of P.L.1972,
c.186 (C.48:5A-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Contracting entity means any
State, county, or municipal entity that enters into a contract with a
contractor for an infrastructure project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Contractor means a person
who is directly awarded and enters into a contract for services related to an
infrastructure project by a contracting entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Coordination meeting means
the meeting conducted by a contracting entity for the purpose of coordinating
the design, planning, and construction of an infrastructure project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Draft infrastructure project
work plan and construction schedule means a draft of a plan and construction
schedule for an infrastructure project being contemplated by a contracting
entity, which shall include, but not be limited to, the preliminary design and
construction completion schedule anticipated for the infrastructure project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Final infrastructure project
work plan and construction schedule means a plan and construction schedule for
an infrastructure project that has been adopted by the contracting entity and
shall include, at a minimum, the final design and construction completion
schedule anticipated for the infrastructure project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     </b>Highway means any
road, street, highway, thoroughfare, bridge, tunnel, overpass, interchange, or
right-of-way which is open to the use of the public for the purpose of
vehicular travel and which is maintained, owned, controlled, or otherwise under
the jurisdiction of the State, a county, or municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Highway project means a
project comprising the planning, acquisition, engineering, construction,
reconstruction, repair, resurfacing, and rehabilitation of a highway and the
planning, acquisition, engineering, construction, reconstruction, repair,
maintenance, and rehabilitation of a public transportation project and of any
other transportation project in which the State or a county or municipality may
be authorized by law to undertake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Impact cost means any direct
