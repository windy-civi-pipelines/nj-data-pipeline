ACR111 ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION No. 111 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 12, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  CAROL A. MURPHY District 7 (Burlington) Assemblywoman  ANNETTE QUIJANO District 20 (Union) Assemblywoman  TENNILLE R. MCCOY District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Reynolds-Jackson SYNOPSIS Urges Congress to reauthorize Violence Against Women Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Concurrent Resolution urging Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. Whereas, The Violence against Women Act of 1994 (Pub.L.103-322) (VAWA) was the first federal enactment recognizing domestic violence and sexual assault as crimes; and Whereas, The 1994 law provided $1.6 billion in federal resources to encourage community-coordinated responses to combat violence by enhancing the ability of states to investigate and prosecute violent crimes perpetrated against women, requiring the imposition of automatic and mandatory restitution on those convicted of these crimes, permitting the federal prosecution of interstate domestic violence and sexual assault cases and the enforcement of interstate protection orders, and allowing for civil redress in cases that prosecutors chose not to prosecute; and Whereas, The VAWA was reauthorized in 2000, improving the foundation of the original law by creating a legal assistance program for victims of violent crimes and expanding the definition of crime to include dating violence and stalking; and Whereas, A subsequent reauthorization of the VAWA in 2005 developed culturally and linguistically-specific criminal, civil justice, and community-based programs geared to meet the emerging needs of ethnic populations across the nation, have dramatically increased the ability of federal, state, and local governmental agencies and victim services organizations to provide critical services to support women in their struggle to overcome abusive situations; and Whereas, The VAWA continues to support comprehensive and cost- effective responses to the crimes of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking on the federal, State, and local levels; and Whereas, The VAWA encourages collaboration among law enforcement agencies, the courts, attorneys, and victim services organizations by creating a leadership role for the federal government that has motivated state, local, and tribal governments to improve responses to victims and perpetrators of these crimes; and Whereas, The law also establishes new federal crimes of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and defines those crimes to fill in jurisdictional gaps in the way the crimes are prosecuted; identifies best practices in the way governmental entities and victim services organizations respond to victims and perpetrators of violent crimes; and focuses on the needs of underserved communities such as immigrant, Native American, gay and transgendered, and prison populations; and Whereas, As a result of the VAWA's enactment, more than 660 new state laws have been enacted to combat domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking, including making stalking a crime and upgrading the criminal penalties for date or spousal rape; additionally, more victims are reporting acts of violence and receiving services that help them move from crisis to stability, and the criminal justice system has improved its ability to keep victims safe and hold perpetrators responsible for their actions; and Whereas, The VAWA not only helps to improve the lives of crime victims but saves money as well; a 2002 study found that the law saved taxpayers approximately $14.8 billion in net averted social costs in its first six years of existence; and Whereas, The current reauthorization of the VAWA expired on  February 15, 2019; and Whereas, The reauthorization bill, H.R. 1620, introduced by Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (Texas), would: enhance judicial and law enforcement tools through the use of STOP grants; develop and enforce firearm surrender policies and expand firearm laws prohibiting persons convicted of certain crimes from possessing firearms; expand programs focused on increasing legal assistance for dependent children of survivors of sexual assault or domestic violence; provide services for young victims of violence and bullying; reauthorize and update programs reducing dating violence, helping children exposed to violence, and engaging men in preventing violence; expand housing protections and provide economic security assistance for survivors of sexual assault or domestic violence; protect Native American women, by including provisions to improve the response to missing and murdered Native American women; and safeguard the Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice; and Whereas, Since 1994, the VAWA has broken new ground in federal, state, tribal, and local responses to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking, and each reauthorization has been renewed with near unanimous support; and Whereas, The United States Congress is urged to reauthorize the VAWA to allow the acts programs to continue to impact the way law enforcement agencies, courts, legal professionals, and victim services organizations respond to, and meet the needs of, victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking, while holding perpetrators responsible for their actions, and to provide additional protections for victims of these crimes; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey (the Senate concurring): 1.    The United States Congress is urged to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) to allow the VAWA's programs to continue to impact the way law enforcement agencies, the courts, legal professionals, and victim services organizations respond to, and meet the needs of, victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, while holding perpetrators responsible for their actions, and to provide additional protections for victims of these crimes. 2.    Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the State to the President of the United States, the Office on Violence Against Women in the United States Department of Justice, and every member of the New Jersey Congressional delegation. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution urges the United States Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) to allow the VAWA's programs to continue to impact the way law enforcement agencies, the courts, legal professionals, and victim services organizations respond to, and meet the needs of, victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, while holding perpetrators responsible for their actions, and to provide additional protections for victims of these crimes.
