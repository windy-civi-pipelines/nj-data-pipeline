CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning student reproductive health at public institutions of higher education and supplementing chapter 61D of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares: a.  Student access to high-quality reproductive health care services is vital to ensuring student health. b.  For students on campuses that do not have access to reproductive health care, it is imperative that these students are directed to trusted health care providers in the local community. c.  Following the Supreme Courts decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, ensuring access to emergency contraceptives and referrals to community providers is imperative. d.  Thirty-nine institutions of higher education across the country have installed vending machines for emergency contraceptives on the campus of the institution. e.  Students at institutions of higher education face unique barriers to accessing emergency contraceptives. A study conducted by medical students in Philadelphia found that one-third of the areas pharmacies did not stock emergency contraceptives.
