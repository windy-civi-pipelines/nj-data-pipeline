<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.2in;text-indent:-.2in;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span><i>:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The social distancing
measures and associated economic pause, that have been necessary to combat the
COVID-19 pandemic, have also forced many New Jersey residents to endure job
losses and prolonged depletions of income;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    As of May 8, 2020, the
unemployment rate of the United States exceeds 14 percent, and is widely
expected to grow higher in the coming weeks;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The residents of New
Jersey have not been able to avoid suffering as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, as the State is widely reported to have the second highest
COVID-19-related death rate in the nation, and the economic impact on many
State residents appears to be similarly catastrophic;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    This unprecedented
situation has made the timely payment of mortgages, rent, and other bills
impossible for many State residents; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     It is, therefore,
necessary and in the public interest for the Legislature to enact temporary
measures to protect the States homeowners, residential tenants, student loan
borrowers and other vulnerable consumers from foreclosure, eviction, and
consumer reporting injustices that are in danger of resulting from this
unprecedented emergency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><sup>&nbsp;</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  As used
in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Creditor means a person or
entity that holds or controls, partially, wholly, indirectly, directly or in a
nominee capacity, a mortgage loan securing an owner-occupied residential
property, including, but not limited to, an originator, holder, investor,
assignee, successor, trust, trustee, nominee holder, or mortgage servicer as
defined in section 2 of P.L.2019, c.65 (C.17:16F-28).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Emergency period means the
period during which a public health emergency exists as declared by the
Governor in Executive Order No. 103 of 2020, as extended, and the 60 days
following the conclusion of this period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Impacted homeowner means an
owner or mortgagor of title to a residential property, which serves as such
persons primary residence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>or as the residence of the owners
tenant, which the impacted homeowner understands to be the tenants primary
residence, and who qualifies for a mortgage forbearance pursuant to section 3
of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Impacted tenant means a
tenant of a residential property who has suffered a substantial reduction of
income, became unemployed, or suffered increased costs due to funeral expenses
or expenses incurred in necessary child care resulting from the closure of
schools or caring for family members who are ill, due to the COVID-19 pandemic
or quarantined due to suspected exposure to COVID-19, or the Public Health
Emergency or State of Emergency declared in response thereto, as attested by
the affidavit for tenant eligibility, pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection
a. of section 6 of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this
bill).  Impacted tenant shall not include any tenant whose household income,
after any hardship, exceeds 100 percent of the Area Median Income as published
by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development for the county
in which the residential dwelling is located or any tenant who possesses one or
more bank accounts that collectively contain reserves equaling six months or
more of the tenants gross income in 2019.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Landlord means any person,
or agent or assignee thereof, who rents or leases or offers to rent or lease,
for a term of at least one-month, dwelling units, except dwelling units in
hotels, motels or other guest houses serving transient or seasonal guests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Mortgage forbearance or
forbearance means a period during which obligations for mortgage principal
and interest payments are suspended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Non-essential eviction means
an eviction for nonpayment or habitually late payment of rent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Residential property means a
property located in the State rented or owned for residential purposes;
provided, however, that residential property shall be limited to the principal
residence of a person or a residential health care facility. Residential
property&quot; shall not include a residence other than a primary residence of
a homeowner or tenant; residential property taken in whole or in part as
collateral for a commercial loan; or a property subject to condemnation or
receivership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  a. 
During the emergency period, a creditor shall grant a mortgage forbearance to
an impacted homeowner if the impacted homeowner submits a written request to
the mortgage servicer affirming the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the impacted homeowner
has suffered a negative financial impact resulting from COVID-19 or the Public
Health Emergency or State of Emergency declared in response thereto, including
but not limited to a financial hardship from a reduction in hours or loss of
employment, loss of income or increased costs incurred in necessary child care
resulting from the closure of schools or caring for family members who are ill
due to COVID-19 or quarantined due to a suspected exposure to COVID-19, or for
funeral costs due to COVID-19;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the gross household
income of the homeowner, after hardship, does not exceed 150 percent of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      Th</span>is bill would provide protections to certain
homeowners, tenants, and landlords during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency period. 
Under the bill, emergency period means the period during which a public
health emergency exists as declared by the Governor in Executive Order No. 103
of 2020, as extended, and the 60 days following the conclusion of this period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that, during
the emergency period, a creditor is required to grant a mortgage forbearance to
an impacted homeowner if the impacted homeowner submits a written request to
the mortgage servicer affirming the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the impacted homeowner
has suffered a substantial reduction of income resulting from COVID-19 or the
Public Health Emergency or State of Emergency declared in response thereto,
including a financial hardship from a reduction in hours or loss of employment,
or increased costs incurred in necessary child care resulting from the closure
of schools or caring for family members who are ill due to COVID-19 or
quarantined due to a suspected exposure to COVID-19, or for funeral costs due
to COVID-19;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;background:white'><span
style='line-height:150%;letter-spacing:0pt'>      (2)  the gross household
income of the homeowner does not exceed 150 percent of the area median income
after hardship, unless this requirement for eligibility is waived by the
mortgage lender; and </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;background:white'><span
style='line-height:150%;letter-spacing:0pt'>      (3)  the impacted homeowners
bank accounts collectively contain less than six months reserves of the
impacted homeowners gross household income for 2019.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon receipt of a request for
a mortgage forbearance from an impacted homeowner, the bill requires a creditor
to provide to the impacted homeowner with a mortgage forbearance and
confirmation of that forbearance in writing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The minimum initial mortgage
forbearance period of an impacted homeowner is to be 90 days.  An impacted
homeowner may request, and is to be granted, a subsequent forbearance period of
at minimum 90 days, for a total of at minimum 180 days. Fees, penalties, or
interest, including attorneys fees, shall not be assessed or accrue during and
as a result of a mortgage forbearance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Consistent with federal law,
the bill provides that a creditor shall not furnish negative mortgage payment
information to a debt collector or credit reporting agency related to mortgage
payments subject to a mortgage forbearance under the bill.  In response to a
complaint to the Attorney General from an impacted homeowner, the Attorney
General may bring an action alleging a creditor has violated this prohibition. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the repayment
period of any mortgage subject to the forbearance would be extended by the
number of months the forbearance is in effect. The payments not made during the
months of the forbearance would instead be due on a monthly basis during the
period constituting an extension of the mortgage, unless the property owner
chooses to make these payments earlier.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An impacted homeowner denied a
forbearance under the bill by a creditor licensed by the Department of Banking
and Insurance (DOBI), and not a State- or nationally-chartered financial
institution, may file a complaint with DOBI.  The department would be required
to investigate the complaint and, if appropriate, would order the creditor to
grant a forbearance to the impacted homeowner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that,
prior to the end of the emergency period, a landlord or owner of a residential
property would not, for the purposes of a residential eviction for nonpayment
or habitually late payment of rent, defined as a non-essential eviction: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   terminate a tenancy; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   file a summary
dispossess action; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   send any notice,
including a notice to quit, requesting or demanding that a tenant of a
residential property vacate the premises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would further require
that, upon the filing of a landlord tenant complaint, the plaintiff landlord
would be required to certify that the complaint is not seeking to evict an
impacted tenant of the tenants primary residence due to nonpayment or
habitually late payment of rent due during the emergency period, except where
the impacted tenant has failed to repay rent due during the emergency period in
accordance with a repayment plan entered in compliance with the bill.  No later
than 60 days following enactment of the bill, the plaintiff landlord in any
landlord/tenant action pending before the court would also be required to
certify that the landlord-tenant complaint is not brought to evict an impacted
tenant of the impacted tenants primary residence due to nonpayment or
habitually late payment of rent due during the emergency period, unless the
impacted tenant has failed to repay rent due during the emergency period in
accordance with a repayment plan entered in compliance with the bill.  However,
rent due from a period prior to the emergency period is not to restrict a
tenant from accessing the protections provided under the bill to other impacted
tenants, so long as the payments has subsequently was made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Consistent with federal law, a
landlord is required not to furnish rental payment data to a collection or
credit reporting agency related to the non-payment of rent during the emergency
period.  The bill further prohibits landlords from refusing to rent to a tenant
or submit the tenants information for placement on a list for the use of other
landlords because of any record or information reflecting the tenants
non-payment of rent during the emergency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, in response to
a complaint to the Attorney General from an impacted tenant, the Attorney
General may bring an action alleging a landlord has violated prohibition on the
furnishing of information to a collection or credit reporting agency.  However,
if a landlord furnishes rental payment data to a collection or credit reporting
agency related to the non-payment of rent during the emergency period, but
before the enactment of this bill, then the landlord would not be subject to
this penalty provision, except for an order to retract of the report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      Additionally, the bill provides that, in order to
avoid mass evictions and widespread homelessness following the conclusion of
the moratorium on evictions required under the bill, a landlord shall offer
each tenant who has missed any partial or full rent payments prior to the end
of the emergency period the ability to enter into an agreement, which would be
an addendum to the lease agreement, for the repayment of any partial or full
rent payments not made during the emergency period, provided the tenants rent
payments were current including payments held in escrow as of the effective
date of Executive Order No. 106 of 2020.  The bill also establishes an income
tax credit for certain landlords who permanently forgive a portion of rent
unpaid during the emergency period.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits a tenant
from accepting an offer from a landlord if the tenants gross household income
exceeds 100 percent of the area median income after hardship unless the
landlord makes an exception; or the tenant possesses one or more bank accounts
that collectively contain reserves equaling six months or more of the tenants
gross household income for 2019.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To prevent a landlord from
losing their primary home in a foreclosure due to COVID-19 economic hardship,
the bill would exempt owners of owner-occupied properties with four or less
units from having to enter into a rent repayment plan with their impacted
tenant if after the owner has completed an application for a mortgage
forbearance, but is denied the forbearance.  Creditors covered in this bill
would be prohibited from denying a landlord of an owner-occupied property a
mortgage forbearance if their tenants cannot pay rent.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     During the repayment period, a
landlord would be prohibited from imposing any late fees or any other fees,
including attorneys fees, for rent payments not made during the emergency
period. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
requires the Department of Community Affairs to prepare and make available on
its Internet website a statement of the rights and responsibilities of impacted
tenants and landlords for the repayment of missed rent payments and an
explanation of, and model template for, the default repayment plans available
pursuant to the bill.  This statement and templates shall be printed in the
English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Russian, Korean, Chinese, and Vietnamese
languages.  Under the bill, not later than 30 days after the statement is made
available by the department, every landlord is required to distribute one copy
of the statement and templates prepared and made available to each of their
impacted tenants within 10 business days after it has been made available by
the department, and landlords may not demand payment of unpaid rent until after
the statement and templates have been distributed to each impacted tenant.  If
a landlord fails to comply with this distribution requirement, this failure may
be used by the impacted tenant as an affirmative defense to an action seeking
the recovery of rent, or to a landlord-tenant complaint seeking a judgment for
possession against the impacted tenant, if brought by the landlord to recover
rent due during the emergency period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that, within
10 business days following the conclusion of the emergency period, a landlord
is required to calculate all partial or full rent payments legally owed and not
made during the emergency period by each impacted tenant liable for rent
repayment pursuant to the bill.  After determining the amount of the missed
payments and applying all credits, if any, due to the impacted tenant, the
landlord is required to provide each impacted tenant with a written notice,
using the template to be prepared and made available on its website by the
department, of the amount owed by the impacted tenant in a form that specifies,
in detail, the amount claimed to be due and an itemization of all credits to
which the impacted tenant is entitled.  All amounts shall be legal and in
compliance with all applicable laws, including local rent control ordinances. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the impacted tenant does
not agree with the amount claimed due, the notice shall provide that the
impacted tenant shall notify the landlord within 25 days after the date on
which the rent and arrearage repayments are to commence; provided, however, that
the impacted tenant shall still begin repayment of missed rent pursuant to the
repayment agreement. If the landlord fails to demonstrate the correctness of
the amount assessed of rent due and owing by the impacted tenant, then the
landlord shall refund any incorrectly assessed amount paid by the tenant plus a
penalty of 20 percent of such amount within 30 days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require <span
style='line-height:150%'>an impacted tenant and landlord to enter into a
written agreement for any unpaid rent during the emergency period.  If the
landlord and impacted tenant are unable to reach an agreement, or if the
agreement is deemed to be unaffordable by the tenant, the bill would require
any unpaid rent during the emergency period to be paid through a default
repayment plan.  The default repayment plan would provide an impacted tenant
with six months to repay each months-worth of rent that was unpaid during the
emergency period.  However, if this schedule would take over 30 months to
repay, then the default repayment plan would require repayments for only 30
months, with each monthly repayment consisting of one-thirtieth of the total
amount of rent left unpaid during the emergency period.  </span><span
style='line-height:150%;letter-spacing:0pt'>that if any rent that went unpaid
during the emergency period continues to be unpaid despite an impacted tenants
compliance with this repayment schedule, then that remaining unpaid rent would
be due in full on the last day of the 30th month of the repayment period.  </span><span
style='line-height:150%'>A surrender of property by an impacted tenant would
not relieve the impacted tenant from the obligation to pay any rent missed
during the emergency period or restrict a landlords ability to recover such
rent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that it
would be unlawful discrimination in violation of the New Jersey Law Against
Discrimination, P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) for a creditor or landlord
to discriminate in application of the bill because of an impacted homeowners
or tenants race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, marital status,
civil union status, domestic partnership status, pregnancy or breastfeeding,
sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, familial
status, disability, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United
States, nationality, or source of lawful income used for rental or mortgage
payments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would additionally
require that, upon written request from a tenant, including electronic
communication, money or other forms of security deposited would be applied to
or credited towards rent payments due or to become due from the tenant during
the emergency period. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     When a tenant applies money or
other forms of security deposited or advanced to pay rent, the following
additional provisions would also apply for the duration of the tenants current
contract, lease, or license agreement: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  The landlord would be
able to recoup from the tenant any monies the landlord expended that would have
been reimbursable by the money or other forms of security deposited or advanced
by the tenant, or interest or earnings thereon, at the time that reimbursement
from such money, security, interest, or earnings would have taken place; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The tenant would
otherwise be without obligation to deposit or advance further money or forms of
security relating to the contract, lease, or license agreement.  However, if
the tenant and landlord extend or renew their contract, lease, or license
agreement following the effective date of the bill, then the tenant would be
obligated to replenish the money or forms of security required under the
contract, lease, or license agreement in full on or before the end of the
emergency period, or on the date on which the current contract, lease, or
license agreement is extended or renewed, whichever is later. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      The bill also would establish
within the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA) a COVID-19
Impact Fund.  Proceeds of the fund may be used: (a) to maintain mortgage
payments and related fees and escrows owed to HMFA for properties which are
approved for mortgage forbearance or otherwise materially impacted by the
impact of COVID-19; and (b) in cases where the value of the Low-Income Housing
Tax Credit has been reduced due to the impact of the public health crisis
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, to close the financing gap caused by the
pricing drop and ensure that the production of affordable housing can
continue.  The Executive Director of HMFA would be permitted to petition the
Commissioner of Community Affairs to transfer funds from the New Jersey
Affordable Housing Trust Fund to the COVID-19 Impact Fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would take effect
immediately and would apply retroactively to rent and mortgage payments missed
subsequent to March 9, 2020.</p>
