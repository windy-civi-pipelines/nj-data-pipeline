Under current law, a law enforcement officer that is required to renew the officers license is required to submit an application through the officers employing law enforcement unit to the Police Training Commission (PTC).  The application is required to be on a form adopted by the PTC and requires the law enforcement officer and the chief law enforcement officer of the officers employing law enforcement unit to certify that the officer meets certain criteria. This bill permits every county sheriff to certify that a law enforcement officer employed by the sheriffs department in that county meets the criteria set forth under current law for the renewal of the officers license.
