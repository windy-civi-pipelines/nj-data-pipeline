<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes various
changes to State school aid, including the local tax levy cap, extraordinary
special education aid, and vocational expansion stabilization aid, and establishes
reduction adjustment aid.  The bill also includes certain additional
requirements for the issuance of the Educational Adequacy Report. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
Department of Education to make available on the departments Internet website
the calculation of aid payable to each school district in the succeeding year
in a user-friendly manner, including explanations of the variables used to
determine the districts aid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a school
district is generally limited to a two percent increase in any single year to
its local tax levy, plus adjustments for increases in enrollment, health care
costs and pension contributions.  The bill would amend this tax levy increase
cap and allow a district to increase its tax levy up to the lesser of: the districts
local share, which is the amount that the current school funding formula
determines that a district can afford to raise locally; or a seven percent
increase from the prior year tax levy.  However, SDA districts would be
permitted to increase their tax levies up to the districts local share.  Any
district, including SDA districts, for which the tax levy is already greater
than the local share would be permitted to increase its tax levy by two percent
of the prebudget year tax levy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a school
district is reimbursed for certain special education costs in the form of
extraordinary special education aid.  Eligible costs are: 90 percent of costs
in excess of $40,000 for students educated in an in-district public school
program with non-disabled peers; 75 percent of costs in excess of $40,000 for
students educated in a separate public school program for students with
disabilities; and 75 percent of tuition costs in excess of $55,000 for students
educated in a separate private school for students with disabilities.  The bill
decreases the cost threshold from $40,000 to $35,000 for students educated in
public school programs that are integrated into the classroom.  The bill also
provides for a gradual phase-in of full funding of extraordinary special
education aid over the span of five years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
provides that, for a county vocational school district that receives vocational
expansion stabilization aid, the amount of vocational expansion stabilization
aid received is to be adjusted to allow for increases in resident enrollment. 
The adjustment is to equal the number of additional students enrolled in the
district multiplied by the additional cost per pupil for county vocational
school districts and the geographic cost adjustment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes
certain municipal overburden protections to prevent a school district from
receiving a reduction in State aid.  Pursuant to the bill, an SDA district
would not be subject to a reduction in State school aid if it is located in a
municipality in which the equalized total tax rate is greater than the
Statewide average equalized total tax rate for the most recently available
calendar year and if the district is spending below adequacy.  In the case of a
school district other than an SDA district, the district would not be subject
to a reduction in State school aid if it is located in a municipality in which
the equalized total tax rate is at least 10 percent greater than the Statewide
average equalized total tax rate for the most recently available calendar year
and is spending at least 10 percent below adequacy.  These municipal overburden
protections would also apply to a regional school district if 50 percent or
more of the districts constituent districts or municipalities met either of
the qualifying criteria.  An SDA district that is spending above adequacy would
not be subject to a reduction in State school aid that exceeds the amount by
which the district is spending above adequacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes
reduction adjustment aid to ensure that the amount of State school aid provided
to a school district is not to be decreased by more than two percent of the
districts prebudget year total operating budget.  The total operating budget
is defined as the sum of a districts general fund revenues from local sources,
State sources, federal sources, and other sources, less any withdrawals from
reserve accounts and reimbursements for extraordinary special education aid. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill makes
certain changes to the Educational Adequacy Report, which is submitted to the
Legislature every three years to update the various parameters used to
calculate State aid to school districts.  Pursuant to the bill, the
Commissioner of Education may initiate a review of certain elements of the
school funding formula, including the metrics for adjusting costs in
intervening years.  Additionally, the bill requires that a draft of the
Educational Adequacy Report be made available for public comment for at least
30 days, during which time members of the public may provide remarks on the
draft report at public hearings to be held at various locations across the
State and through the submission of written and electronic testimony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, during the
development of the next Educational Adequacy Report following enactment of this
bill, the commissioner is to engage a diverse group of stakeholders to review
and make recommendations concerning: the calculation of a districts local
share and whether the metrics used are best able to estimate a districts
potential adjusted tax levy; the impact and feasibility of using multi-year
averages in the calculation of local share; the feasibility of implementing a
tier-based model of funding for determining special education categorical aid;
the abilities of the Department of Education and school districts to predict
and anticipate State school aid amounts from year to year; and possible methods
of improving upon the existing preschool funding methodology.</p>
