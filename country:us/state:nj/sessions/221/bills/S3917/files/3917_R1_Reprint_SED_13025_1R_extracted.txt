The base per pupil amount, the per pupil amounts for full-day preschool, the excess costs for general special education services pupils and for speech-only pupils, and the cost-coefficients for security aid and transportation aid shall be adjusted by the CPI, or other inflationary measures disclosed in the most recently issued Educational Adequacy Report, for each of the two school years following the first school year to which the report is applicable. The amounts published in the final version of the Educational Adequacy Report issued pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed approved for the three successive fiscal years beginning from the subsequent July 1, unless between the date of transmittal and the subsequent November 30, the Legislature adopts a concurrent resolution stating that the Legislature is not in agreement with all or any specific part of the report. The concurrent resolution shall advise the Governor of the Legislature's specific objections to the report and shall direct the commissioner to submit to the Legislature a revised report which responds to those objections by January 1. c.     The Educational Adequacy Report issued pursuant to subsection b. of this section may also include a commissioner-initiated review of any other element, variable, or metric used to determine allocations of State school aid pursuant to P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.).  The commissioner shall publicly announce the intent to conduct a review pursuant to this section at the time that the decision to conduct the review is made and prior to initiating the review.  An element, variable, or metric that is the subject of a commissioner-initiated review pursuant to this subsection shall not be decreased pursuant to the review. During a year in which the report required pursuant subsection b. of this section is to be issued, the commissioner shall make a draft of the report available for public comment for a period of no less than 30 days. During the public comment period, the commissioner shall ensure that members of the public are afforded the opportunity to provide remarks on, and recommend revisions to, the draft report at public hearings to be held at various locations across the State, as well as through the submission of written and electronic testimony. After consideration of comments received through the public comment period, the commissioner shall issue a final version of the report. (cf: P.L.2007, c.260, s.4) 1[5] 31. Section 13 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-55) is amended to read as follows: 13. a. Special education categorical aid for each school district and county vocational school district shall be calculated as follows: SE = (RE x SEACR x AEC x 1/3) x GCA where RE is the resident enrollment of the school district or county vocational school district; SEACR is the State average classification rate for general special education services pupils; AEC is the excess cost for general special education services pupils; and GCA is the geographic cost adjustment as developed by the commissioner. For the 2008-2009 school year the excess cost shall be $10,898 for general special education services pupils. The excess cost amount shall be adjusted by the CPI in the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years as required pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-46).  For subsequent school years, the excess cost amount shall be established in the Educational Adequacy Report, with the amount adjusted by the CPI for each of the two school years following the first school year to which the report is applicable. b.    Extraordinary special education aid for an individual classified pupil shall be available when the student is educated in a general education classroom, special education program, including but not limited to a resource program or special class program, or any combination of general education and special education programs and services, subject to the requirements and thresholds set forth in this section. (1)   In those instances in which a pupil is educated in an in-district public school program with non-disabled peers, whether run by a public school or by a private school for the disabled, and the cost of providing direct instructional and support services for an individual classified pupil exceeds [$40,000] 1[$35,000] $40,0001, for those direct instructional and support services costs in excess of [$40,000] 1[$35,000] $40,0001 a district shall receive extraordinary special education State aid equal to 1[90%] 90 percent1 of the amount of that excess in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection. (2)   In those instances in which a pupil is educated in a separate public school program for students with disabilities and the cost of providing direct instructional and support services for an individual classified pupil exceeds $40,000, for those direct instructional and support services costs in excess of $40,000 a district shall receive extraordinary special education State aid equal to 1[75%] 75 percent1 of the amount of that excess in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection. (3)   In those instances in which a pupil is educated in a separate private school for students with disabilities and the tuition for an individual classified pupil exceeds $55,000, for tuition costs in excess of $55,000 a district shall receive extraordinary special education State aid equal to 1[75%] 75 percent1 of the amount of that excess in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection. (4)   Extraordinary special education State aid for an individual classified pupil shall be calculated as follows: EA = ((ADC-[$40,000] 1[$35,000] $40,0001) x .90) + (((AIC - $40,000) + (ASC - $55,000)) x .75) where ADC equals the district's actual cost for the direct instructional and support services in an in-district public school program as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection; AIC equals the district's actual cost for direct instructional and support services in a separate public school program as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and ASC equals the district's actual cost for tuition paid to a separate private school as set forth in paragraph (3) of this subsection. (5)   The receipt of extraordinary special education State aid for an individual classified pupil shall be conditioned upon a demonstration by the district that the pupil's Individualized Education Plan requires the provision of intensive services, pursuant to factors determined by the commissioner. c.     In order to receive funding pursuant to this section, a district shall file an application with the department that details the expenses incurred on behalf of the particular classified pupil for which the district is seeking reimbursement.  Additional State aid awarded for extraordinary special education costs shall be recorded by the district as revenue in the current school year and paid to the district in the subsequent school year. d.    A school district may apply to the commissioner to receive emergency special education aid for any classified pupil who enrolls in the district prior to March of the budget year and who is in a placement with a cost in excess of [$40,000 or $55,000, as applicable] the applicable extraordinary special education aid thresholds enumerated in subsection b. of this section.  The commissioner may debit from the student's former district of residence any special education aid which was paid to that district on behalf of the student. e.     The department shall review expenditures of federal and State special education aid by a district in every instance in which special education monitoring identifies a failure on the part of the district to provide services consistent with a pupil's Individualized Education Plan. f.     The commissioner shall commission an independent study of the special education census funding methodology to determine if adjustments in the special education funding formulas are needed in future years to address the variations in incidence of students with severe disabilities requiring high cost programs and to make recommendations for any such adjustments.  The study and recommendations shall be completed by June 30, 2010. g.    A school district may apply to the commissioner to receive additional special education categorical aid if the district has an unusually high rate of low-incidence disabilities, such as autism, deaf/blindness, severe cognitive impairment, and medically fragile. In applying for the aid the district shall: demonstrate the impact of the unusually high rate of low-incidence disabilities on the school district budget and the extent to which the costs to the district are not sufficiently addressed through special education aid and extraordinary special education aid; and provide details of all special education expenditures, including details on the use of federal funds to support those expenditures. h.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, 1[a school districts receipt of extraordinary special education aid shall be equal to a percent of the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection b. of this section according to the following schedule: (1) 80 percent in the first full school year following the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (2) 85 percent in the second full school year following the effective date of P.L.    , c.

(1) The allowable adjustment for increases in enrollment authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal the per pupil prebudget year adjusted tax levy multiplied by EP, where EP equals the sum of: (a)   0.50 for each unit of weighted resident enrollment that constitutes an increase from the prebudget year over 1%, but not more than 2.5%; (b)   0.75 for each unit of weighted resident enrollment that constitutes an increase from the prebudget year over 2.5%, but not more than 4%; and (c)   1.00 for each unit of weighted resident enrollment that constitutes an increase from the prebudget year over 4%. (2)   A school district may request approval from the commissioner to calculate EP equal to 1.00 for any increase in weighted resident enrollment if it can demonstrate that the calculation pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection would result in an average class size that exceeds 10% above the facilities efficiency standards established pursuant to P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.). c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.44) d.
