Under the bill, the landlord is required to provide tenants with notice within five business days of the landlords receipt of the written notice.  If the landlord, either directly or through an agent, intends to conduct hazardous work on a property adjoining a property occupied by the landlords tenant, then the bill would require the landlord to provide notice to the tenant prior to the works commencement.  The bill specifies that the notice may be provided to each affected tenant by mail, by posting in at least one conspicuous area where the information is most likely to be viewed by tenants, or by electronic delivery.
