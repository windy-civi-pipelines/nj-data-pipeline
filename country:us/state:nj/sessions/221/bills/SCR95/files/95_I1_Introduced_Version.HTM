SCR95 SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION No. 95 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 7, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  DOUGLAS J. STEINHARDT District 23 (Hunterdon, Somerset and Warren) Senator  PARKER SPACE District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) SYNOPSIS Urges Congress and President of US to enact legislation addressing interstate transportation of firearms or ammunition. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Concurrent Resolution urging Congress and the President of the United States to enact legislation addressing the interstate transportation of firearms or ammunition. Whereas, The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution affirms the right of the people to keep and bear arms and establishes the bedrock of federal law concerning the possession of firearms; and Whereas, Despite this constitutional assurance, strict state laws have exposed law-abiding gun owners to criminal penalties when exercising their right to transport licensed firearms across state lines; and Whereas, This criminalization of law-abiding gun owners constitutes an injustice requiring remedial federal action; and Whereas, Under the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 (FOPA), a person is entitled to transport a firearm to and from a state where it may be lawfully possessed, regardless of that firearms legality in any intermediary state, provided that the firearm is neither loaded or readily accessible during the period of transport; and Whereas, Notwithstanding this federal protection, individuals regularly confront legal issues when transporting licensed firearms through states with strict gun laws; and Whereas, New Jerseys onerous gun laws contribute to the criminalization of law-abiding citizens who have chosen to exercise their right to transport a legal firearm through the State; and Whereas, For example, while flying through the Newark International Airport on a trip to Allentown, Pennsylvania in 2005, Utah-native Greg Revell was detained for 10 days in a New Jersey jail after attempting to transport his legally-owned firearm; and Whereas, After a delay caused Revell to miss a connecting flight in Newark, he was forced to stay overnight in New Jersey before continuing to his destination; and Whereas, Despite compliance with federal guidelines requiring him to store his unloaded firearm in a locked container and inform airline personnel that his checked luggage contained a firearm, Port Authority police officers arrested Revell for illegally possessing a firearm and ammunition in New Jersey as he attempted to board his departing flight; and Whereas, While FOPA intended to protect individuals in this situation, authorities contended that Revells firearm was readily accessible during his overnight stay, and therefore his actions were not protected under federal law; and Whereas, Although criminal charges were withdrawn months later, Revell faced the possibility of imprisonment, despite his every attempt to comply with federal law; and Whereas, That unpredictable travel events which require overnight stays, such as a missed flight, can expose otherwise law-abiding gun owners to the possibility of imprisonment constitutes a serious injustice that should be rectified; and Whereas, In response, Rep. Morgan Griffith has introduced H.R.225, which increases protections for a person who transports a licensed firearm to and from a state where it may be legally possessed; and Whereas, By amending FOPA, this bills provisions protect licensed gun owners who have stored their unloaded firearm in a locked container during travel and intend to use that firearm for lawful purposes; and Whereas, Most importantly, this bill expands the legal protections afforded to these individuals by broadening the definition of transport to include while staying in temporary lodging overnight, stopping for food, fuel, vehicle maintenance, an emergency, medical treatment, or any other activity incidental to the transport; and Whereas, This provision ensures that a law-abiding gun owner, like Greg Revell, will be protected from the possibility of imprisonment, even if an unpredictable event were to alter his itinerary and require overnight lodging; and Whereas, Enactment of H.R.225 would therefore remedy a loophole in federal law that contributes to the unjust criminalization of law-abiding citizens; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey (the General Assembly concurring): 1.    The Legislature of this State respectfully urges Congress and the President of the United States to enact H.R.225, which addresses the interstate transportation of firearms or ammunition. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the President of the United States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and each member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution urges Congress and the President of the United States to enact H.R.225, which addresses interstate transportation of firearms or ammunition.  In amending the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, this bill provides increased legal protection for a person who transports a licensed firearm to and from a state where it may be legally possessed, provided that the firearm remains unloaded and stored in a locked container.  In particular, the bill broadens the definition of transport to offer legal protection for traveling gun owners during overnight stays; medical emergencies; food, fuel, and vehicle maintenance stops; as well as any activity incidental to transport. Under current law, a law-abiding gun owner may face imprisonment for choosing to exercise their constitutional right to transport legal firearms through a state with strict gun laws.  For example, despite his every attempt to comply with federal guidelines, Greg Revell was jailed for 10 days in New Jersey after attempting to travel through the State in 2005 with his licensed firearm.  Moreover, the chances of unnecessary legal complications are increased when unpredictable events, such as delayed or missed flights, disrupt a travelers itinerary, as was the case with Mr. Revell.  This criminalization of law-abiding citizens is an injustice that requires remedial federal action in the form of H.R.225.
