Time correlated or continuous tracking of the offender's geographic location shall not be provided during the time a monitored subject is in custody due to arrest, incarceration, or civil commitment. c.     Nothing in this act shall be construed to preclude a judge from ordering time correlated or continuous tracking of the person's geographic location or other electronic monitoring as a condition of discharge of a person committed pursuant to P.L.1998, c.71 (C.30:4-27.24 et al.), or as a condition or requirement of supervision for any other person sentenced pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1 or sentenced to a term of community or parole supervision for life pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1994, c.130 (C.2C:43-6.4). d.    A monitored subject shall pay for the cost of any equipment carried or worn by the subject in compliance with the provisions of this act and the daily cost charged to the State by the monitoring company for that subject, unless the subject provides proof to the satisfaction of the chairman that the requirements of this subsection would constitute an extreme financial hardship.  The chairman shall develop a test to determine whether the requirements of this subsection would constitute an extreme financial hardship for a monitored subject.

Specifically, the sex offender would be required to pay for the cost of any equipment he or she must carry or wear and to pay the daily cost charged to the State by the monitoring company for his or her monitoring. An exception could be made for a sex offender who provides proof to the satisfaction of the Chairman of the State Parole Board that paying for the cost of the equipment and monitoring would subject the offender to extreme financial hardship.  The chairman is required to develop a test to determine whether the requirements would constitute an extreme financial hardship for a monitored offender.
