<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 19 of P.L.2021,
c.16 (C.24:6I-36) is amended to read as follows</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     19.  Application For License
or Conditional License. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Each application for an
annual license to operate a cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery
service, or conditional license for a proposed cannabis establishment, distributor,
or delivery service, shall be submitted to the commission.  A separate license
or conditional license shall be required for each location at which a cannabis
establishment seeks to operate, or for the location of each premises from which
a cannabis distributor or delivery service seeks to operate. Renewal
applications for another annual license shall be filed no later than 90 days
prior to the expiration of the establishment's, distributor's, or delivery
service's license. A conditional license shall not be renewed, but replaced
with an annual license upon the commission's determination of qualification for
the annual license, or otherwise expire, as set forth in paragraph (2) of
subsection b. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  Regarding the
application for and issuance of annual licenses, the commission shall: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   begin accepting and
processing applications within 30 days after the commission's initial rules and
regulations have been adopted pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (1) of
subsection d. of section 6 of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-34); </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   forward, within 14 days
of receipt, a copy of each application to the municipality in which the
applicant desires to operate the cannabis establishment, distributor, or
delivery service; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   verify the information
contained in the application and review the qualifications for the applicable
license class, set forth in section 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, or 26 of P.L.2021, c.16
(C.24:6I-37, C.24:6I-39, C.24:6I-40, C.24:6I-41, C.24:6I-42, or C.24:6I-43),
and regulations concerning qualifications for licensure promulgated by the
commission for which the applicant seeks licensure, and not more than 90 days
after the receipt of an application, make a determination as to whether the
application is approved or denied, or that the commission requires more time to
adequately review the application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission shall deny a
license application to any applicant who fails to provide information,
documentation and assurances as required by P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.) or
as requested by the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>commission, or who fails to reveal
any material fact to qualification, or who supplies information which is untrue
or misleading as to a material fact pertaining to the qualification criteria
for licensure.  The commission shall approve a license application that meets
the requirements of this section unless the commission finds by clear and
convincing evidence that the applicant would be manifestly unsuitable to
perform the activities for the applicable license class for which licensure is
sought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    If the application is
approved, upon collection of the license fee, the commission shall issue an
annual license to the applicant no later than 30 days after giving notice of
approval of the application unless the commission finds the applicant is not in
compliance with regulations for annual licenses enacted pursuant to the
provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection d. of section 6 of P.L.2021, c.16
(C.24:6I-34) or the commission is notified by the relevant municipality that
the applicant is not in compliance with ordinances and regulations made
pursuant to the provisions of section 31 of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-45) and in
effect at the time of application, provided, if a municipality has enacted a
numerical limit on the number of cannabis establishments, distributors, or
delivery services and a greater number of applicants seek licenses, the
commission shall solicit and consider input from the municipality as to the
municipality's preference or preferences for licensure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   If the application is
denied, the commission shall notify the applicant in writing of the specific
reason for its denial, and provide the applicant with the opportunity for a
hearing in accordance with the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968,
c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Regarding the
application for and issuance of conditional licenses, the commission shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   begin accepting and
processing applications from applicants within 30 days after the commission's
initial rules and regulations have been adopted pursuant to subparagraph (a) of
paragraph (1) of subsection d. of section 6 of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-34), and
ensure that at least 35 percent of the total licenses issued for each class of
cannabis establishment, and for cannabis distributors and delivery services,
are conditional licenses, which 35 percent figure shall also include any
conditional license issued to an applicant which is subsequently replaced by
the commission with an annual license due to that applicant's compliance for
the annual license pursuant to subsubparagraph (i) of subparagraph (d) of this
paragraph; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   forward, within 14 days
of receipt, a copy of each application to the municipality in which the
applicant desires to operate a proposed cannabis establishment, or to the municipality
in which the premises is located from which the applicant desires to operate a
proposed cannabis distributor or delivery service; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   verify the information
contained in the application and review the following qualifications for a
conditional license:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    that the application
include at least one significantly involved person who has resided in this
State for at least two years as of the date of the application;</p>

submission of an attestation and maintenance of a labor peace agreement with a
bona fide labor organization by an applicant issued a conditional license for a

effort to enter, into a collective bargaining agreement within 200 days of the
opening of a licensed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service,

pursuant to a process set forth in regulation and consistent with this
subsection, adjust the point system or utilize a separate point system and
rankings with respect to the review of an application for which a conditional
license is sought, or for which a microbusiness license is sought. If two or
more eligible applicants have the same number of points, those applicants shall
be grouped together and, if there are more eligible applicants in this group

by an applicant pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall, upon
receiving notice from the applicant of the declination, award the license to
the applicant for that license class who, in the determination of the
commission, best satisfies the commission's criteria while meeting the
