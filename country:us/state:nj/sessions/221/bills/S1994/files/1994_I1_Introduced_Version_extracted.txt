If two or more eligible applicants have the same number of points, those applicants shall be grouped together and, if there are more eligible applicants in this group than the remaining number of licenses available, the commission shall utilize a public lottery to determine which applicants receive a license or conditional license, as the case may be.

(4)   The commission shall give special consideration to any applicant that has entered into an agreement with an institution of higher education to create an integrated curriculum involving the cultivation, manufacturing, wholesaling, distributing, retail sales, or delivery of personal use cannabis or cannabis items, provided that the curriculum is approved by both the commission and the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education and the applicant agrees to maintain the integrated curriculum in perpetuity.  An integrated curriculum license shall be subject to revocation if the license holder fails to maintain or continue the integrated curriculum. In the event that, because of circumstances outside a license holder's control, the license holder will no longer be able to continue an integrated curriculum, the license holder shall notify the commission and shall make reasonable efforts to establish a new integrated curriculum with an institution of higher education, subject to approval by the commission and the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education.  If the license holder is unable to establish a new integrated curriculum within six months after the date the current integrated curriculum arrangement ends, the commission shall revoke the entity's license, unless the commission finds there are extraordinary circumstances that justify allowing the license holder to retain the license without an integrated curriculum and the commission finds that allowing the license holder to retain the license would be consistent with the purposes of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.).  The commission may revise the application and license fees or other conditions for a license pursuant to this paragraph as may be necessary to encourage applications for licensure which involves an integrated curriculum.

(6)   If the commission notifies an applicant that it has performed sufficiently well on multiple applications to be awarded more than one license, the applicant shall notify the commission, within seven business days after receiving such notice, as to which class of license it will accept.  For any license award that is declined by an applicant pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall, upon receiving notice from the applicant of the declination, award the license to the applicant for that license class who, in the determination of the commission, best satisfies the commission's criteria while meeting the commission's determination of Statewide marketplace need.  If an applicant fails to notify the commission as to which license it will accept, the commission shall have the discretion to determine which license it will award to the applicant, based on the commission's determination of Statewide marketplace need and other applications submitted for cannabis establishments, distributors, or delivery services to be located in the affected regions. e.     (1)  The commission shall also prioritize applications on the basis of impact zones, for which past criminal marijuana enterprises contributed to higher concentrations of law enforcement activity, unemployment, and poverty, or any combination thereof, within parts of or throughout these zones, regardless of whether there is any competition among applications for a particular class of license.  An "impact zone" means any municipality that: (a)   has a population of 120,000 or more according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census as of the effective date of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.); (b)   based upon data for calendar year 2019: (i)    ranks in the top 40 percent of municipalities in the State for marijuana- or hashish-related arrests for violation of paragraph (4) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10; (ii)   has a crime index total of 825 or higher based upon the indexes listed in the annual Uniform Crime Report by the Division of State Police; and (iii) has a local average annual unemployment rate that ranks in the top 15 percent of all municipalities in the State, based upon average annual unemployment rates estimated for the relevant calendar year by the Office of Research and Information in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development; (c)   is a municipality located in a county of the third class, based upon the county's population according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census as of the effective date of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), that meets all of the criteria set forth in subparagraph (b) other than having a crime index total of 825 or higher; or (d)   is a municipality located in a county of the second class, based upon the county's population according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census as of the effective date of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.): (i) with a population of less than 60,000 according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census, that for calendar year 2019 ranks in the top 40 percent of municipalities in the State for marijuana- or hashish-related arrests for violation of paragraph (4) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10; has a crime index total of 1,000 or higher based upon the indexes listed in the 2019 annual Uniform Crime Report by the Division of State Police; but for calendar year 2019 does not have a local average annual unemployment rate that ranks in the top 15 percent of all municipalities, based upon average annual unemployment rates estimated for the relevant calendar year by the Office of Research and Information in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development; or (ii) with a population of not less than 60,000 or more than 80,000 according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census; has a crime index total of 650 or higher based upon the indexes listed in the 2019 annual Uniform Crime Report; and for calendar year 2019 has a local average annual unemployment rate of 3.0 percent or higher using the same estimated annual unemployment rates; or (e)  is a municipality located in a county of the fifth class with a population of over 600,000 based upon the county's population according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census as of the effective date of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), in which municipalities received State urban aid. (2)   In ranking applications with respect to impact zones, the commission shall give priority to the following: (a)   An application for a cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service that is located, or is intended to be located, within an impact zone, and that impact zone has less than two licensees, so that there will be a prioritized distribution of licenses to at least two licensees within each impact zone. (b)   An applicant who is a current resident of an impact zone and has resided therein for three or more consecutive years at the time of making the application.  To the extent reasonably practicable, at least 25 percent of the total licenses issued to applicants for a cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service license shall be awarded to applicants who have resided in an impact zone for three or more consecutive years at the time of making the application, regardless of where the cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service is, or is intended to be, located. (c)   An applicant who presents a plan, attested to, to employ at least 25 percent of employees who reside in an impact zone, of whom at least 25 percent shall reside in the impact zone nearest to the location, or intended location, of the cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service; failure to meet the requisite percentages of employees from an impact zone within 90 days of the opening of a licensed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service shall result in the suspension or revocation of a license or conditional license, as applicable, issued based on an application with an impact zone employment plan. f.     (1)  The commission shall ensure that at least 10 percent of the total licenses issued for each class of cannabis establishment, or for cannabis distributors and cannabis delivery services, are designated for and only issued to microbusinesses, and that at least 25 percent of the total licenses issued be issued to microbusinesses.  The determination of the percentage for each class of license issued to microbusinesses shall include the number of conditional licenses issued to microbusinesses for each class, as the percentage of conditional licenses issued for each class pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section shall not be mutually exclusive of the percentage of licenses issued to microbusinesses pursuant to this subsection.  There shall not be any cap or other numerical restriction on the number of licenses issued to microbusinesses pursuant to P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), and this prohibition on a cap or other numerical restriction shall apply to every class of license issued.  The maximum fee assessed by the commission for issuance or renewal of a license designated and issued to a microbusiness shall be no more than half the fee applicable to a license of the same class issued to a person or entity that is not a microbusiness. (2)   A microbusiness shall meet the following requirements: (a)   100 percent of the ownership interest in the microbusiness shall be held by current New Jersey residents who have resided in the State for at least the past two consecutive years; (b)   at least 51 percent of the owners, directors, officers, or employees of the microbusiness shall be residents of the municipality in which the microbusiness is located, or to be located, or a municipality bordering the municipality in which the microbusiness is located, or to be located; (c)   concerning business operations, and capacity and quantity restrictions: (i)    employ no more than 10 employees; (ii)   operate a cannabis establishment occupying an area of no more than 2,500 square feet, and in the case of a cannabis cultivator, grow cannabis on an area no more than 2,500 square feet measured on a horizontal plane and grow above that plane not higher than 24 feet; provided, that a cannabis cultivator's grow space may, if approved by the commission, be part of a larger premises that is owned or operated by a cannabis cultivator that is not a licensed microbusiness, allowing for the sharing of a physical premises and certain business operations, but only the microbusiness cannabis cultivator shall grow cannabis on and above the cultivator's grow space; (iii) possess no more than 1,000 cannabis plants each month, except that a cannabis distributor's possession of cannabis plants for transportation shall not be subject to this limit; (iv)  in the case of a cannabis manufacturer, acquire no more than 1,000 pounds of usable cannabis each month; (v)   in the case of a cannabis wholesaler, acquire for resale no more than 1,000 pounds of usable cannabis, or the equivalent amount in any form of manufactured cannabis product or cannabis resin, or any combination thereof, each month; and (vi)  in the case of a cannabis retailer, acquire for retail sale no more than 1,000 pounds of usable cannabis, or the equivalent amount in any form of manufactured cannabis product or cannabis resin, or any combination thereof, each month; (d)   no owner, director, officer, or other person with a financial interest who also has decision making authority for the microbusiness shall hold any financial interest in any other licensed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service, whether or not a microbusiness; (e)   no owner, director, officer, or other person with a financial interest who also has decision making authority for a licensed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service, whether or not a microbusiness, shall hold any financial interest in a microbusiness; (f)   the microbusiness shall not sell or transfer the license issued to it; and (g)   the microbusiness shall comply with such other requirements as may be established by the commission by regulation. (3)   A license designated and issued to a microbusiness shall be valid for one year and may be renewed annually, or alternatively replaced, while still valid, with an annual license allowing the microbusiness to convert and continue its operations as a licensed person or entity that is not a microbusiness subject to the provisions of this subsection, based upon a process and criteria established by the commission in regulation for the conversion. (a)   Any microbusiness that meets the criteria established by the commission for conversion may submit an application to convert its operations.  Upon review of the application to confirm the commission's criteria have been met, the commission shall issue a new annual license to the person or entity, and the previously issued license for the microbusiness shall be deemed expired as of the date of issuance of the new annual license.  If the commission determines that the criteria have not been met, the conversion application shall be denied, and the commission shall notify the microbusiness applicant of the specific reason for its denial, and provide the applicant with the opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (b)   Any new annual license issued pursuant to this paragraph allowing a microbusiness to convert and continue its operations as a licensed person or entity that is not a microbusiness subject to the provisions of this subsection shall be counted towards the percentages of licenses that are designated for and only issued to microbusinesses as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, notwithstanding the microbusiness' converted operations. (cf: P.L.2021, c.16, s.19) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would modify the definition of impact zones in P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act.  Under the bill, in addition to the definition of the term set out in the enactment, an impact zone would also include a municipality located in a county of the fifth class with a population of over 600,000 based upon the county's population according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census, in which municipalities received State urban aid. Under the enactment, impact zones are one of the factors taken into consideration by the Cannabis Regulatory Commission in considering applications for licenses for cannabis businesses. As defined in P.L.2021, c.16, impact zones are certain municipalities negatively impacted by past marijuana enterprises that contributed to higher concentrations of law enforcement activity, unemployment, and poverty, or any combination thereof.

As used in this subsection, "bona fide labor organization" means a labor organization of any kind or employee representation committee, group, or association, in which employees participate and which exists and is constituted for the purpose, in whole or in part, of collective bargaining or otherwise dealing with medical or personal use cannabis employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, terms or conditions of employment, including wages and rates of pay, or other mutual aid or protection in connection with employment, and may be characterized by: it being a party to one or more executed collective bargaining agreements with medical or personal use cannabis employers, in this State or another state; it having a written constitution or bylaws in the three immediately preceding years; it filing the annual financial report required of labor organizations pursuant to subsection (b) of 29 U.S.C. s.431, or it having at least one audited financial report in the three immediately preceding years; it being affiliated with any regional or national association of unions, including but not limited to state and federal labor councils; or it being a member of a national labor organization that has at least 500 general members in a majority of the 50 states of the United States. d.  (1)  Each license application shall be scored and reviewed based upon a point scale with the commission determining the amount of points, the point categories, and the system of point distribution by regulation.  The commission shall assign points and rank applicants according to the point system.  The commission may, pursuant to a process set forth in regulation and consistent with this subsection, adjust the point system or utilize a separate point system and rankings with respect to the review of an application for which a conditional license is sought, or for which a microbusiness license is sought. If two or more eligible applicants have the same number of points, those applicants shall be grouped together and, if there are more eligible applicants in this group than the remaining number of licenses available, the commission shall utilize a public lottery to determine which applicants receive a license or conditional license, as the case may be. (a)   An initial application for licensure shall be evaluated according to criteria to be developed by the commission.  There shall be included bonus points for applicants who are residents of New Jersey.

(v)   A community impact, social responsibility, and research statement, which may include, but shall not be limited to, the following: - a community impact plan summarizing how the applicant intends to have a positive impact on the community in which the proposed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service is to be located, which shall include an economic impact plan and a description of outreach activities; - a written description of the applicant's record of social responsibility, philanthropy, and ties to the proposed host community; - a written description of any research the applicant has conducted on the adverse effects of the use of cannabis items, substance abuse or addiction, and the applicant's participation in or support of cannabis-related research and educational activities; and - a written plan describing any research and development regarding the adverse effects of cannabis, and any cannabis-related educational and outreach activities, which the applicant intends to conduct if issued a license by the commission. In evaluating the information submitted pursuant to this subsubparagraph, the commission shall afford the greatest weight to responses pertaining to the applicant itself, controlling owners, and entities with common ownership or control with the applicant; followed by those with a 15 percent or greater ownership interest in the applicant's organization; followed by significantly involved persons in the applicant's organization; followed by other officers, directors, and current and prospective employees of the applicant who have a bona fide relationship with the applicant's organization as of the date of the application. (vi)  A workforce development and job creation plan, which may include information on the applicant's history of job creation and planned job creation at the proposed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service; education, training, and resources to be made available for employees; any relevant certifications; and an optional diversity plan.

For the purposes of this subsubparagraph, the commission shall consider only bank references involving accounts in the name of the applicant or of an entity with common ownership or control with the applicant.  An applicant who does not submit the information about a plan of compliance with the federal "Bank Secrecy Act" shall not be disqualified from consideration. (viii)  Whether any of the applicant's majority or controlling owners were previously approved by the commission to serve as an officer, director, principal, or key employee of an alternative treatment center or personal use cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service, provided any such individual served in that capacity for six or more months; (ix)  Any other information the commission deems relevant in determining whether to grant a license to the applicant. (2)   In ranking applications, in addition to the awarding of points as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the commission shall give priority to the following, regardless of whether there is any competition among applications for a particular class of license: (a)   Applicants that include a significantly involved person or persons lawfully residing in New Jersey for at least five years as of the date of the application. (b)   Applicants that are party to a collective bargaining agreement with a bona fide labor organization that currently represents, or is actively seeking to represent cannabis workers in New Jersey. (c)   Applicants that are party to a collective bargaining agreement with a bona fide labor organization that currently represents cannabis workers in another state. (d)   Applicants that submit a signed project labor agreement with a bona fide building trades labor organization, which is a form of pre-hire collective bargaining agreement covering terms and conditions of a specific project, including labor issues and worker grievances associated with that project, for the construction or retrofit of the facilities associated with the licensed entity. (e)   Applicants that submit a signed project labor agreement with a bona fide labor organization for any other applicable project associated with the licensed entity. As used in this paragraph, "bona fide labor organization" means "bona fide labor organization" as defined in subsection c. of this section, and includes a bona fide building trades labor organization. (3)   In reviewing an initial license application, unless the information is otherwise solicited by the commission in a specific application question, the commission's evaluation of the application shall be limited to the experience and qualifications of the applicant's organization, including controlling owners, any entities with common ownership or control with the applicant, those with a 15 percent or greater ownership interest in the applicant's organization, significantly involved persons in the applicant's organization, the other officers, directors, and current or prospective employees of the applicant who have a bona fide relationship with the applicant's organization as of the date of the application, and consultants and independent contractors who have a bona fide relationship with the applicant as of the date of the application. Responses pertaining to applicants who are exempt from the criminal history record background check requirements of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.) shall not be considered.  Each applicant shall certify as to the status of the individuals and entities included in the application. (4)   The commission shall give special consideration to any applicant that has entered into an agreement with an institution of higher education to create an integrated curriculum involving the cultivation, manufacturing, wholesaling, distributing, retail sales, or delivery of personal use cannabis or cannabis items, provided that the curriculum is approved by both the commission and the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education and the applicant agrees to maintain the integrated curriculum in perpetuity.  An integrated curriculum license shall be subject to revocation if the license holder fails to maintain or continue the integrated curriculum. In the event that, because of circumstances outside a license holder's control, the license holder will no longer be able to continue an integrated curriculum, the license holder shall notify the commission and shall make reasonable efforts to establish a new integrated curriculum with an institution of higher education, subject to approval by the commission and the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education.  If the license holder is unable to establish a new integrated curriculum within six months after the date the current integrated curriculum arrangement ends, the commission shall revoke the entity's license, unless the commission finds there are extraordinary circumstances that justify allowing the license holder to retain the license without an integrated curriculum and the commission finds that allowing the license holder to retain the license would be consistent with the purposes of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.).  The commission may revise the application and license fees or other conditions for a license pursuant to this paragraph as may be necessary to encourage applications for licensure which involves an integrated curriculum. (5)   Application materials submitted to the commission pursuant to this section shall not be considered a public record pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5 et al.), or the common law concerning access to government records. (6)   If the commission notifies an applicant that it has performed sufficiently well on multiple applications to be awarded more than one license, the applicant shall notify the commission, within seven business days after receiving such notice, as to which class of license it will accept.  For any license award that is declined by an applicant pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall, upon receiving notice from the applicant of the declination, award the license to the applicant for that license class who, in the determination of the commission, best satisfies the commission's criteria while meeting the commission's determination of Statewide marketplace need.  If an applicant fails to notify the commission as to which license it will accept, the commission shall have the discretion to determine which license it will award to the applicant, based on the commission's determination of Statewide marketplace need and other applications submitted for cannabis establishments, distributors, or delivery services to be located in the affected regions. e.     (1)  The commission shall also prioritize applications on the basis of impact zones, for which past criminal marijuana enterprises contributed to higher concentrations of law enforcement activity, unemployment, and poverty, or any combination thereof, within parts of or throughout these zones, regardless of whether there is any competition among applications for a particular class of license.  An "impact zone" means any municipality that: (a)   has a population of 120,000 or more according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census as of the effective date of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.); (b)   based upon data for calendar year 2019: (i)    ranks in the top 40 percent of municipalities in the State for marijuana- or hashish-related arrests for violation of paragraph (4) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10; (ii)   has a crime index total of 825 or higher based upon the indexes listed in the annual Uniform Crime Report by the Division of State Police; and (iii) has a local average annual unemployment rate that ranks in the top 15 percent of all municipalities in the State, based upon average annual unemployment rates estimated for the relevant calendar year by the Office of Research and Information in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development; (c)   is a municipality located in a county of the third class, based upon the county's population according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census as of the effective date of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), that meets all of the criteria set forth in subparagraph (b) other than having a crime index total of 825 or higher; or (d)   is a municipality located in a county of the second class, based upon the county's population according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census as of the effective date of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.): (i) with a population of less than 60,000 according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census, that for calendar year 2019 ranks in the top 40 percent of municipalities in the State for marijuana- or hashish-related arrests for violation of paragraph (4) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10; has a crime index total of 1,000 or higher based upon the indexes listed in the 2019 annual Uniform Crime Report by the Division of State Police; but for calendar year 2019 does not have a local average annual unemployment rate that ranks in the top 15 percent of all municipalities, based upon average annual unemployment rates estimated for the relevant calendar year by the Office of Research and Information in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development; or (ii) with a population of not less than 60,000 or more than 80,000 according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census; has a crime index total of 650 or higher based upon the indexes listed in the 2019 annual Uniform Crime Report; and for calendar year 2019 has a local average annual unemployment rate of 3.0 percent or higher using the same estimated annual unemployment rates; or (e)  is a municipality located in a county of the fifth class with a population of over 600,000 based upon the county's population according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census as of the effective date of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), in which municipalities received State urban aid. (2)   In ranking applications with respect to impact zones, the commission shall give priority to the following: (a)   An application for a cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service that is located, or is intended to be located, within an impact zone, and that impact zone has less than two licensees, so that there will be a prioritized distribution of licenses to at least two licensees within each impact zone. (b)   An applicant who is a current resident of an impact zone and has resided therein for three or more consecutive years at the time of making the application.  To the extent reasonably practicable, at least 25 percent of the total licenses issued to applicants for a cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service license shall be awarded to applicants who have resided in an impact zone for three or more consecutive years at the time of making the application, regardless of where the cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service is, or is intended to be, located. (c)   An applicant who presents a plan, attested to, to employ at least 25 percent of employees who reside in an impact zone, of whom at least 25 percent shall reside in the impact zone nearest to the location, or intended location, of the cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service; failure to meet the requisite percentages of employees from an impact zone within 90 days of the opening of a licensed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service shall result in the suspension or revocation of a license or conditional license, as applicable, issued based on an application with an impact zone employment plan. f.     (1)  The commission shall ensure that at least 10 percent of the total licenses issued for each class of cannabis establishment, or for cannabis distributors and cannabis delivery services, are designated for and only issued to microbusinesses, and that at least 25 percent of the total licenses issued be issued to microbusinesses.  The determination of the percentage for each class of license issued to microbusinesses shall include the number of conditional licenses issued to microbusinesses for each class, as the percentage of conditional licenses issued for each class pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section shall not be mutually exclusive of the percentage of licenses issued to microbusinesses pursuant to this subsection.  There shall not be any cap or other numerical restriction on the number of licenses issued to microbusinesses pursuant to P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), and this prohibition on a cap or other numerical restriction shall apply to every class of license issued.  The maximum fee assessed by the commission for issuance or renewal of a license designated and issued to a microbusiness shall be no more than half the fee applicable to a license of the same class issued to a person or entity that is not a microbusiness. (2)   A microbusiness shall meet the following requirements: (a)   100 percent of the ownership interest in the microbusiness shall be held by current New Jersey residents who have resided in the State for at least the past two consecutive years; (b)   at least 51 percent of the owners, directors, officers, or employees of the microbusiness shall be residents of the municipality in which the microbusiness is located, or to be located, or a municipality bordering the municipality in which the microbusiness is located, or to be located; (c)   concerning business operations, and capacity and quantity restrictions: (i)    employ no more than 10 employees; (ii)   operate a cannabis establishment occupying an area of no more than 2,500 square feet, and in the case of a cannabis cultivator, grow cannabis on an area no more than 2,500 square feet measured on a horizontal plane and grow above that plane not higher than 24 feet; provided, that a cannabis cultivator's grow space may, if approved by the commission, be part of a larger premises that is owned or operated by a cannabis cultivator that is not a licensed microbusiness, allowing for the sharing of a physical premises and certain business operations, but only the microbusiness cannabis cultivator shall grow cannabis on and above the cultivator's grow space; (iii) possess no more than 1,000 cannabis plants each month, except that a cannabis distributor's possession of cannabis plants for transportation shall not be subject to this limit; (iv)  in the case of a cannabis manufacturer, acquire no more than 1,000 pounds of usable cannabis each month; (v)   in the case of a cannabis wholesaler, acquire for resale no more than 1,000 pounds of usable cannabis, or the equivalent amount in any form of manufactured cannabis product or cannabis resin, or any combination thereof, each month; and (vi)  in the case of a cannabis retailer, acquire for retail sale no more than 1,000 pounds of usable cannabis, or the equivalent amount in any form of manufactured cannabis product or cannabis resin, or any combination thereof, each month; (d)   no owner, director, officer, or other person with a financial interest who also has decision making authority for the microbusiness shall hold any financial interest in any other licensed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service, whether or not a microbusiness; (e)   no owner, director, officer, or other person with a financial interest who also has decision making authority for a licensed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service, whether or not a microbusiness, shall hold any financial interest in a microbusiness; (f)   the microbusiness shall not sell or transfer the license issued to it; and (g)   the microbusiness shall comply with such other requirements as may be established by the commission by regulation. (3)   A license designated and issued to a microbusiness shall be valid for one year and may be renewed annually, or alternatively replaced, while still valid, with an annual license allowing the microbusiness to convert and continue its operations as a licensed person or entity that is not a microbusiness subject to the provisions of this subsection, based upon a process and criteria established by the commission in regulation for the conversion. (a)   Any microbusiness that meets the criteria established by the commission for conversion may submit an application to convert its operations.  Upon review of the application to confirm the commission's criteria have been met, the commission shall issue a new annual license to the person or entity, and the previously issued license for the microbusiness shall be deemed expired as of the date of issuance of the new annual license.  If the commission determines that the criteria have not been met, the conversion application shall be denied, and the commission shall notify the microbusiness applicant of the specific reason for its denial, and provide the applicant with the opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (b)   Any new annual license issued pursuant to this paragraph allowing a microbusiness to convert and continue its operations as a licensed person or entity that is not a microbusiness subject to the provisions of this subsection shall be counted towards the percentages of licenses that are designated for and only issued to microbusinesses as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, notwithstanding the microbusiness' converted operations. (cf: P.L.2021, c.16, s.19) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would modify the definition of impact zones in P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act.  Under the bill, in addition to the definition of the term set out in the enactment, an impact zone would also include a municipality located in a county of the fifth class with a population of over 600,000 based upon the county's population according to the most recently compiled federal decennial census, in which municipalities received State urban aid. Under the enactment, impact zones are one of the factors taken into consideration by the Cannabis Regulatory Commission in considering applications for licenses for cannabis businesses. As defined in P.L.2021, c.16, impact zones are certain municipalities negatively impacted by past marijuana enterprises that contributed to higher concentrations of law enforcement activity, unemployment, and poverty, or any combination thereof.
