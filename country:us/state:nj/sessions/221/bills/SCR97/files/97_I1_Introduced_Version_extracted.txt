The law so enacted shall extend that $250 property tax deduction to the surviving spouse of the person who, during his or her life, received a deduction pursuant to this paragraph, as long as the surviving spouse remains unmarried and a resident of the same primary residence, provided that the surviving spouse is 65 years of age or older. 2.    When this proposed amendment to the Constitution is finally agreed to pursuant to Article IX, paragraph 1 of the Constitution, it shall be submitted to the people at the next general election occurring more than three months after the final agreement and shall be published at least once in at least one newspaper of each county designated by the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the General Assembly and the Secretary of State, not less than three months prior to the general election. 3.    This proposed amendment to the Constitution shall be submitted to the people at that election in the following manner and form: There shall be printed on each official ballot to be used at the general election, the following: a.     In every municipality in which voting machines are not used, a legend which shall immediately precede the question as follows: If you favor the proposition printed below make a cross (X), plus (+), or check (a) in the square opposite the word "Yes." If you are opposed thereto make a cross (X), plus (+) or check (a) in the square opposite the word "No." b.    In every municipality the following question: PROPERTY TAX DEDUCTION FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITH A PERMANENT DISABILITY YES Do you approve amending the Constitution to give an annual property tax deduction to law enforcement officers who have sustained a permanent disability?  The deduction would be $250.  The surviving spouse would receive the deduction after the officers death. INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This amendment would give an annual property tax deduction to law enforcement officers who have sustained a permanent disability and the officers surviving spouse. The deduction would be $250. Officers would have to be disabled due to the law enforcement service.  The disability does not have to be a total disability, but would have to be permanent. Officers would have to own real property in order to receive this deduction. STATEMENT If approved by the voters of the State, this proposed constitutional amendment would provide an annual $250 property tax deduction to law enforcement officers who have been permanently disabled as the result of their law enforcement service, and to their surviving spouses. The proposed amendment directs the Legislature to define the law enforcement officers eligible to receive the $250 property tax deduction.
