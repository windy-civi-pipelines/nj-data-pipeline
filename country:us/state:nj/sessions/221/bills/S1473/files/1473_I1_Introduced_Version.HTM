<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 4 of P.L.1972,
c.70 (C.39:6A-4) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    Personal injury
protection coverage, regardless of fault.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Except as provided by section
45 of P.L.2003, c.89 (C.39:6A-3.3) and section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21
(C.39:6A-3.1), every standard automobile liability insurance policy issued or
renewed on or after the effective date of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-1.1 et al.)
shall contain personal injury protection benefits for the payment of benefits
without regard to negligence, liability or fault of any kind, to the named
insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustain bodily
injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting
from or using an automobile, or as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by
an object propelled by or from an automobile, and to other persons sustaining
bodily injury while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the
automobile of the named insured, with permission of the named insured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Personal injury
protection coverage&quot; means and includes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Payment of medical
expense benefits in accordance with a benefit plan provided in the policy and
approved by the commissioner, for reasonable, necessary, and appropriate
treatment and provision of services to persons sustaining bodily injury, in an
amount <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>not
to exceed<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>that is no less than $50,000 per person per accident and no more than</u>
$250,000 per person per accident.  In the event benefits paid by an insurer
pursuant to this subsection are in excess of $75,000 on account of bodily
injury to any one person in any one accident, that excess shall be paid by the
insurer and shall be reimbursable to the insurer from the Unsatisfied Claim and
Judgment Fund pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1977, c.310 (C.39:6-73.1).  The
policy form, which shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner, shall
set forth the benefits provided under the policy, including eligible medical
treatments, diagnostic tests and services as well as such other benefits as the
policy may provide.  The commissioner shall set forth by regulation a statement
of the basic benefits which shall be included in the policy.  Medical
treatments, diagnostic tests, and services provided by the policy shall be
rendered in accordance with commonly accepted protocols and professional
standards and practices which are commonly accepted as being beneficial for the
treatment of the covered injury. Protocols and professional standards and practices
and lists of valid diagnostic tests which are deemed to be commonly accepted
pursuant to this section shall be those recognized by national standard setting
organizations, national or state professional organizations of the same
discipline as the treating provider, or those designated or approved by the
commissioner in consultation with the professional licensing boards in the
Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety.  The
commissioner, in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health
and Senior Services and the applicable licensing boards, may reject the use of
protocols, standards and practices or lists of diagnostic tests set by any
organization deemed not to have standing or general recognition by the provider
community or the applicable licensing boards. Protocols shall be deemed to
establish guidelines as to standard appropriate treatment and diagnostic tests
for injuries sustained in automobile accidents, but the establishment of
standard treatment protocols or protocols for the administration of diagnostic
tests shall not be interpreted in such a manner as to preclude variance from
the standard when warranted by reason of medical necessity.  The policy form
may provide for the precertification of certain procedures, treatments,
diagnostic tests, or other services or for the purchase of durable medical
goods, as approved by the commissioner, provided that the requirement for
precertification shall not be unreasonable, and no precertification requirement
shall apply within ten days of the insured event.  The policy may provide that
certain benefits provided by the policy which are in excess of the basic
benefits required by the commissioner to be included in the policy may be
subject to reasonable copayments in addition to the copayments provided for
pursuant to subsection e. of this section, provided that the copayments shall
not be unreasonable and shall be established in such a manner as not to serve
to encourage underutilization of benefits subject to the copayments, nor
encourage overutilization of benefits.  The policy form shall clearly set forth
any limitations on benefits or exclusions, which may include, but need not be
limited to, benefits which are otherwise compensable under workers' compensation,
or benefits for treatments deemed to be experimental or investigational, or
benefits deducted pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-6).  The
commissioner may enlist the services of a benefit consultant in establishing
the basic benefits level provided in this subsection, which shall be set forth
by regulation no later than 120 days following the enactment date of P.L.1998,
c.21 (C.39:6A-1.1 et al.).  The commissioner shall not advertise for bids for
the consultant as provided in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-8 and
52:34-9).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding the provisions
of P.L.2003, c.18, physical therapy treatment shall not be reimbursable as
medical expense benefits pursuant to this subsection unless rendered by a
licensed physical therapist pursuant to a referral from a licensed physician,

and 39:6A-4), any owner or registered owner of an automobile registered or

providing the following coverage:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Personal injury
protection coverage, for the payment of benefits without regard to negligence,
liability or fault of any kind, to the named insured and members of his family
residing in his household, who sustained bodily injury as a result of an
accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile,
or as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or
from an automobile, and to other persons sustaining bodily injury while
occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named
insured, with the permission of the named insured.  &quot;Personal injury
protection coverage&quot; issued pursuant to this section means and includes
payment of medical expense benefits, as provided in the policy and approved by
the commissioner, for the reasonable and necessary treatment of bodily injury
in an amount not to exceed <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>$15,000<b><span

injuries rendered at a trauma center or acute care hospital immediately
following the accident and until the patient is stable, no longer requires
critical care and can be safely discharged or transferred to another facility
in the judgment of the attending physician.  In the event benefits paid by an
insurer pursuant to this subsection are in excess of $75,000 on account of
personal injury to any one person in any one accident covered by a policy issued
or renewed prior to January 1, 2004, such excess shall be paid by the insurer
and shall be reimbursable to the insurer from the Unsatisfied Claim and
Judgment Fund pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1977, c.310 (C.39:6-73.1).  Benefits
provided under basic coverage shall be in accordance with a benefit plan
provided in the policy and approved by the commissioner.  The policy form,
which shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner, shall set forth the
benefits provided under the policy, including eligible medical treatments,
diagnostic tests and services as well as such other benefits as the policy may
provide.  The commissioner shall set forth by regulation a statement of the
basic benefits which shall be included in the policy.  Medical treatments, diagnostic
tests, and services provided by the policy shall be rendered in accordance with
commonly accepted protocols and professional standards and practices which are
commonly accepted as being beneficial for the treatment of the covered injury.
Protocols and professional standards and practices which are deemed to be
commonly accepted pursuant to this section shall be those recognized by
national standard setting organizations, national or state professional
organizations of the same discipline as the treating provider, or those
designated or approved by the commissioner in consultation with the
professional licensing boards in the Division of Consumer Affairs in the
Department of Law and Public Safety. The commissioner, in consultation with the
Commissioner of the Department of Health <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and

and practices or lists of diagnostic tests set by any organization deemed not
to have standing or general recognition by the provider community or the
applicable licensing boards. Protocols shall be deemed to establish guidelines
as to standard appropriate treatment and diagnostic tests for injuries
sustained in automobile accidents, but the establishment of standard treatment
protocols or protocols for the administration of diagnostic tests shall not be
interpreted in such a manner as to preclude variance from the standard when
warranted by reason of medical necessity.  The policy form may provide for the
precertification of certain procedures, treatments, diagnostic tests, or other
services or for the purchase of durable medical goods, as approved by the
commissioner, provided that the requirement for precertification shall not be
unreasonable, and no precertification requirement shall apply within ten days
of the insured event.  The policy may provide that certain benefits provided by
the policy which are in excess of the basic benefits required by the
commissioner to be included in the policy may be subject to reasonable copayments
in addition to the copayments provided for herein, provided that the copayments
shall not be unreasonable and shall be established in such a manner as not to
serve to encourage underutilization of benefits subject to the copayments, nor
encourage overutilization of benefits.  The policy form shall clearly set forth
any limitations on benefits or exclusions, which may include, but need not be
limited to, benefits which are otherwise compensable under workers'
compensation, or benefits for treatments deemed to be experimental or
investigational, or benefits deducted pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1972, c.70
(C.39:6A-6).  The commissioner may enlist the services of a benefit consultant
in establishing the basic benefits level provided in this subsection, which
shall be set forth by regulation no later than 120 days following the enactment
date of this amendatory and supplementary act.  The commissioner shall not
advertise for the consultant as provided in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1954, c.48
