STATEMENT This bill provides a resident trapping license fee discount to senior citizens.  The current law provides discounted licensing rates to senior citizens only with regard to resident fishing, firearm hunting, and bow hunting.  Accordingly, this bill would fill a gap in the statute by providing senior citizens with a resident trapping license fee discount that is consistent with the discounts already authorized for other closely related outdoor activities.
