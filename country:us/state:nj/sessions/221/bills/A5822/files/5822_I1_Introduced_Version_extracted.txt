(2)  Each casino licensee, sports wagering licensee, or contracted operator, shall establish an employee training program to familiarize their employees with the cybersecurity program and industry best practices. b.    In every calendar year following the implementation of a cybersecurity program in accordance with subsection a. of this section, all casino licensees and sports wagering licensees shall, at their own expense, arrange for the conduct of an audit of their cybersecurity program, and that of their contracted operators, by an independent third party of sufficient technical expertise.  The audit shall ensure the cybersecurity program that has been implemented complies with applicable regulations and current industry best practices.  The auditor shall certify the findings of the audit, which shall be submitted to the division and the Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell by a date to be determined by the division. c.     Whenever a final revision to one or more of the frameworks listed in subsection a. of this section is published, a casino licensee, sports wagering licensee, or contracted operator whose cybersecurity program substantially complied with that framework shall revise their cybersecurity program to substantially comply with the revised framework, and submit a copy of the revised cybersecurity program to the division and the Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell, no later than 180 days after publication of the revised framework. d.    The division, in consultation with the Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell and pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the implementation of this act.  At a minimum, such rules and regulations shall: (1)  identify classes of employees that will require cybersecurity training or advanced training; (2)  determine the frequency and methods of certification for employee cybersecurity trainings; (3)  identify specific aspects of the cybersecurity program that should be assessed in the course of required audits; (4)  establish the necessary forms for submitting audits and certifications, as required by this section; (5)  require the reporting of any cybersecurity breach that affects the operations of a licensee, compromises the personal data of patrons, or exposes financial systems information within 72 hours of said breach; and (6)  establish procedures for reporting cybersecurity breaches and protocols for response.

To implement the requirements of this bill, the division, in consultation with the Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell, will establish regulations that: (1)  identify classes of employees that will require cybersecurity training or advanced training; (2)  determine the frequency and methods of certification for employee cybersecurity trainings; (3)  identify specific aspects of the cybersecurity program that should be assessed in the course of required audits; (4)  establish the necessary forms for submitted audits and certifications, as required by this section; (5)  require the reporting of any cybersecurity breach that affects the operations of a licensee, compromises the personal data of patrons, or exposes financial systems information within 72 hours of said breach; and (6)  establish procedures for reporting cybersecurity breaches and protocols for response.

The bill also establishes a safe gaming certification program for licensees and contracted operators that exceed minimum standards in cybersecurity.  The minimum standards will include: (1)  the use of enhanced encryption and fraud detection systems; (2)  transparency measures; (3)  performance of independent audits exceeding those required by law; (4)  adoption of appropriate artificial intelligence and blockchain security features; and (5)  readily accessible responsible gaming tools such as deposit and time limits. If these standards are met, the licensee and contracted operator will be awarded a Safe Gaming Seal which may be displayed prominently on their Internet gaming website, mobile applications, and in advertisements. Finally, the bill requires the division and the Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell to complete an annual report assessing the implementation of cybersecurity programs under the bill and identifying emerging threats in the gaming industry.
