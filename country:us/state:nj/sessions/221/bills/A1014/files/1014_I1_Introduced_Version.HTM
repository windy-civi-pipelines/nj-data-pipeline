While the Period of PURPLE Crying is a normal developmental phase for infants, increased and unsoothable crying often leads to shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma when a parent or caregiver shakes an infant out of frustration or anger. The Period of PURPLE Crying program is an educational, evidence-based shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma prevention program offered in hospitals and other community based organizations to support parents and caregivers in their understanding of increased and unsoothable infant crying and help reduce the incidence of shaken baby syndrome and abusive head trauma. A public awareness campaign to provide information to parents and caregivers about the Period of PURPLE Crying program, increased and unsoothable infant crying, shaken baby syndrome, and abusive head trauma is in the public interest and will serve the interests of public safety in this State.
