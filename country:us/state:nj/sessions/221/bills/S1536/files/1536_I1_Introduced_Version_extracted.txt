Subject to the provision of subsection e. of N.J.S.2C:52-14 requiring denial of an expungement petition when a person has had a previous criminal conviction expunged, a prior conviction for another crime, disorderly persons offense, or petty disorderly persons offense that is not listed in a single judgment of conviction shall not bar presenting an application seeking expungement relief for the convictions listed in a single judgment of conviction that are the subject of the application; or the person has been convicted of multiple crimes or a combination of one or more crimes and one or more disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offenses under the laws of this State, which crimes or combination of crimes and offenses were interdependent or closely related in circumstances and were committed as part of a sequence of events that took place within a comparatively short period of time, regardless of the date of conviction or sentencing for each individual crime or offense, and the person does not otherwise have any subsequent conviction for another crime or offense in addition to those convictions included in the expungement application, whether any such conviction was within this State or any other jurisdiction. Subject to the provision of subsection e. of N.J.S.2C:52-14 requiring denial of an expungement petition when a person has had a previous criminal conviction expunged, a prior conviction for another crime, disorderly persons offense, or petty disorderly persons offense that was not interdependent or closely related in circumstances and was not committed within a comparatively short period of time as described above shall not bar presenting an application seeking expungement relief for the convictions of crimes or crimes and offenses that were interdependent or closely related and committed within a comparatively short period of time, and that are the subject of the application. For purposes of determining eligibility to present an expungement application to the Superior Court pursuant to this section, a conviction for unlawful distribution of, or possessing or having under control with intent to distribute, marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (11) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5, or a lesser amount of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (12) of subsection b. of that section, or a violation of either of those paragraphs and a violation of subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.1987, c.101 (C.2C:35-7) or subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.1997, c.327 (C.2C:35-7.1), for distributing, or possessing or having under control with intent to distribute, on or within 1,000 feet of any school property, or on or within 500 feet of the real property comprising a public housing facility, public park, or public building, or for obtaining or possessing marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10, or for an equivalent crime in another jurisdiction, regardless of when the conviction occurred, shall not be considered a conviction of a crime within this State or any other jurisdiction but shall instead be considered a conviction of a disorderly persons offense within this State or an equivalent category of offense within the other jurisdiction, and a conviction for obtaining, possessing, using, being under the influence of, or failing to make lawful disposition of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (4) of subsection a., or subsection b., or subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:35-10, or a violation involving marijuana or hashish as described herein and using or possessing with intent to use drug paraphernalia with that marijuana or hashish in violation of N.J.S.2C:36-2, or for an equivalent crime or offense in another jurisdiction, regardless of when the conviction occurred, shall not be considered a conviction within this State or any other jurisdiction. The person, if eligible, may present the expungement application after the expiration of a period of five years from the date of his most recent conviction, payment of any court-ordered financial assessment, satisfactory completion of probation or parole, or release from incarceration, whichever is later.  The term "court-ordered financial assessment" as used herein and throughout this section means and includes any fine, fee, penalty, restitution, and other form of financial assessment imposed by the court as part of the sentence for the conviction or convictions that are the subject of the application, for which payment of restitution takes precedence in accordance with chapter 46 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.  The person shall submit the expungement application to the Superior Court in the county in which the most recent conviction for a crime was adjudged, which includes a duly verified petition as provided in N.J.S.2C:52-7 praying that the conviction, or convictions if applicable, and all records and information pertaining thereto be expunged. The petition appended to an application shall comply with the requirements set forth in N.J.S.2C:52-1 et seq. Notwithstanding the provisions concerning the five-year time requirement, if, at the time of application, a court-ordered financial assessment subject to collection under the comprehensive enforcement program established pursuant to P.L.1995, c.9 (C.2B:19-1 et al.) is not yet satisfied due to reasons other than willful noncompliance, but the time requirement of five years is otherwise satisfied, the person may submit the expungement application and the court may grant an expungement; provided, however, that if expungement is granted the court shall enter a civil judgment for the unpaid portion of the court-ordered financial assessment in the name of the Treasurer, State of New Jersey and transfer collections and disbursement responsibility to the State Treasurer for the outstanding amount in accordance with section 8 of P.L.2017, c.244 (C.2C:52-23.1).  The Treasurer may specify, and the Administrative Office of the Courts shall collaborate with, the technical and informational standards required to effectuate the transfer of the collection and disbursement responsibilities. Notwithstanding any provision in this law or any other law to the contrary, the court shall have sole discretion to amend the judgment. Additionally, an application may be filed and presented, and the court may grant an expungement pursuant to this section, although less than five years have expired in accordance with the time requirements when the court finds: (1)   the court-ordered financial assessment is satisfied but less than five years have expired from the date of satisfaction, and the time requirement of five years is otherwise satisfied, and the court finds that the person substantially complied with any payment plan ordered pursuant to N.J.S.2C:46-1 et seq., or could not do so due to compelling circumstances affecting his ability to satisfy the assessment; or (2)   at least four but less than five years have expired from the date of the most recent conviction, payment of any court-ordered financial assessment, satisfactory completion of probation or parole, or release from incarceration, whichever is later; and the person has not been otherwise convicted of a crime, disorderly persons offense, or petty disorderly persons offense since the time of the most recent conviction; and the court finds in its discretion that compelling circumstances exist to grant the expungement. The prosecutor may object pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2019, c.269 (C.2C:52-10.1), N.J.S.2C:52-11, N.J.S.2C:52-14, or N.J.S.2C:52-24. In determining whether compelling circumstances exist for the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a court may consider the amount of any court-ordered financial assessment imposed, the person's age at the time of the offense or offenses, the person's financial condition and other relevant circumstances regarding the person's ability to pay. b.    Records of conviction pursuant to statutes repealed by this Code for the crimes of murder, manslaughter, treason, anarchy, kidnapping, rape, forcible sodomy, arson, perjury, false swearing, robbery, embracery, or a conspiracy or any attempt to commit any of the foregoing, or aiding, assisting or concealing persons accused of the foregoing crimes, shall not be expunged. Records of conviction for the following crimes specified in the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice shall not be subject to expungement: N.J.S.2C:11-1 et seq.

(cf: P.L.2019, c.269, s.2) 2.    N.J.S.2C:52-7 is amended to read as follows: 2C:52-7.  Petition for Expungement.  Every petition for expungement filed pursuant to this chapter shall be verified and include: a.     Petitioner's date of birth. b.    Petitioner's date of arrest. c.     The statute or statutes and offense or offenses for which petitioner was arrested and of which petitioner was convicted. d.    The original indictment, summons or complaint number. e.     Petitioner's date of conviction, or date of disposition of the matter if  no conviction resulted. f.     The court's disposition of the matter and the punishment imposed, if any. If a petition is for the expungement of more than one conviction pursuant to section 3 of P.L.   , c. (C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the petition shall include the information set forth in this section for each conviction. (cf: N.J.S.2C:52-7) 3.    (New section)    a.   Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.2C:52-2 to the contrary, pursuant to this section a person convicted of more than one crime of the third or fourth degree under the laws of this State may present a duly verified petition as provided in N.J.S.2C:52-7 and the court may grant an expungement for each conviction if the person has not been adjudged a disorderly person or petty disorderly person on more than two occasions, and has affirmatively demonstrated to the court clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation.  In determining whether clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation has been demonstrated, the court may consider the following factors: (1)   the nature and seriousness of the crimes; (2)   the circumstances under which the crimes occurred; (3)   the date of the crimes; (4)   the age of the person when the crimes were committed; (5)   the social conditions which may have contributed to the crimes; and (6)   Any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of persons who have or have had the applicant under their supervision. Although subsequent convictions for no more than two disorderly or petty disorderly offenses shall not be an absolute bar to relief, the nature of the convictions and the circumstances surrounding them shall be considered by the court and may be a basis for denial of relief if they or either of them constitute a continuation of the type of unlawful activity embodied in the criminal convictions for which expungement is sought. b.    The provisions of this section shall not apply to a person convicted of a crime of the first or second degree, or a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2). 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides courts with the authority to grant an expungement in certain circumstances where an individual would otherwise be disqualified under current law. As provided in N.J.S.2C:52-2, a person who has been convicted of a crime, or a combination of one crime and less than four disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offenses which were not closely related in circumstances or in time would be eligible to seek expungement relief.  Alternatively, the person could seek expungement relief if convicted of more than one crime or a combination of crimes and disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offenses which were closely related in circumstances or in time. This bill grants individuals who have been convicted of more than one crime of the third or fourth degree the opportunity for expungement relief, if it can be demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the individual has been rehabilitated. In determining whether clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation has been demonstrated, the court may consider the following factors: (1)   the nature and seriousness of the crimes; (2)   the circumstances under which the crimes occurred; (3)   the date of the crimes; (4)   the age of the person when the crimes were committed; (5)   the social conditions which may have contributed to the crimes; and (6)   any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of persons who have or have had the applicant under their supervision. This bill would not apply to an individual who has been convicted of a crime of the first or second degree, or a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2).

(cf: P.L.2019, c.269, s.2) 2.    N.J.S.2C:52-7 is amended to read as follows: 2C:52-7.  Petition for Expungement.  Every petition for expungement filed pursuant to this chapter shall be verified and include: a.     Petitioner's date of birth. b.    Petitioner's date of arrest. c.     The statute or statutes and offense or offenses for which petitioner was arrested and of which petitioner was convicted. d.    The original indictment, summons or complaint number. e.     Petitioner's date of conviction, or date of disposition of the matter if  no conviction resulted. f.     The court's disposition of the matter and the punishment imposed, if any. If a petition is for the expungement of more than one conviction pursuant to section 3 of P.L.   , c. (C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the petition shall include the information set forth in this section for each conviction. (cf: N.J.S.2C:52-7) 3.    (New section)    a.   Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.2C:52-2 to the contrary, pursuant to this section a person convicted of more than one crime of the third or fourth degree under the laws of this State may present a duly verified petition as provided in N.J.S.2C:52-7 and the court may grant an expungement for each conviction if the person has not been adjudged a disorderly person or petty disorderly person on more than two occasions, and has affirmatively demonstrated to the court clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation.  In determining whether clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation has been demonstrated, the court may consider the following factors: (1)   the nature and seriousness of the crimes; (2)   the circumstances under which the crimes occurred; (3)   the date of the crimes; (4)   the age of the person when the crimes were committed; (5)   the social conditions which may have contributed to the crimes; and (6)   Any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of persons who have or have had the applicant under their supervision. Although subsequent convictions for no more than two disorderly or petty disorderly offenses shall not be an absolute bar to relief, the nature of the convictions and the circumstances surrounding them shall be considered by the court and may be a basis for denial of relief if they or either of them constitute a continuation of the type of unlawful activity embodied in the criminal convictions for which expungement is sought. b.    The provisions of this section shall not apply to a person convicted of a crime of the first or second degree, or a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2). 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides courts with the authority to grant an expungement in certain circumstances where an individual would otherwise be disqualified under current law. As provided in N.J.S.2C:52-2, a person who has been convicted of a crime, or a combination of one crime and less than four disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offenses which were not closely related in circumstances or in time would be eligible to seek expungement relief.  Alternatively, the person could seek expungement relief if convicted of more than one crime or a combination of crimes and disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offenses which were closely related in circumstances or in time. This bill grants individuals who have been convicted of more than one crime of the third or fourth degree the opportunity for expungement relief, if it can be demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the individual has been rehabilitated. In determining whether clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation has been demonstrated, the court may consider the following factors: (1)   the nature and seriousness of the crimes; (2)   the circumstances under which the crimes occurred; (3)   the date of the crimes; (4)   the age of the person when the crimes were committed; (5)   the social conditions which may have contributed to the crimes; and (6)   any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of persons who have or have had the applicant under their supervision. This bill would not apply to an individual who has been convicted of a crime of the first or second degree, or a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2).
