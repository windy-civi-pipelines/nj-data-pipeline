financial assessment&quot; as used herein and throughout this section means and
includes any fine, fee, penalty, restitution, and other form of financial
assessment imposed by the court as part of the sentence for the conviction or
convictions that are the subject of the application, for which payment of restitution
takes precedence in accordance with chapter 46 of Title 2C of the New Jersey

adjudged, which includes a duly verified petition as provided in N.J.S.2C:52-7
praying that the conviction, or convictions if applicable, and all records and

noncompliance, but the time requirement of five years is otherwise satisfied,
the person may submit the expungement application and the court may grant an
expungement; provided, however, that if expungement is granted the court shall
enter a civil judgment for the unpaid portion of the court-ordered financial
assessment in the name of the Treasurer, State of New Jersey and transfer
collections and disbursement responsibility to the State Treasurer for the
outstanding amount in accordance with section 8 of P.L.2017, c.244
(C.2C:52-23.1).  The Treasurer may specify, and the Administrative Office of
the Courts shall collaborate with, the technical and informational standards
required to effectuate the transfer of the collection and disbursement
responsibilities. Notwithstanding any provision in this law or any other law to
the contrary, the court shall have sole discretion to amend the judgment.            </p>

financial assessment is satisfied but less than five years have expired from
the date of satisfaction, and the time requirement of five years is otherwise

to compelling circumstances affecting his ability to satisfy the assessment; or</p>

otherwise convicted of a crime, disorderly persons offense, or petty disorderly
