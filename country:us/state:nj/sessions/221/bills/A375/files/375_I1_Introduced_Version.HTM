<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)    a. The
Attorney General and the State Parole Board shall establish a program for
electronic monitoring of certain defendants charged with or convicted of any of
the following crimes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) sexual assault or
aggravated sexual assault pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-2;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) human trafficking pursuant
to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.77 (C.2C:13-8); </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) kidnapping pursuant to
N.J.S.2C:13-1;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) a crime involving domestic
violence as defined in section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19); or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) a crime of contempt of a
domestic violence order entered pursuant to P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et al.)
or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. The program established by
P.L.    , c.    (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)
shall also provide for notification to the victims. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)    a.   Electronic
monitoring pursuant to the program established by P.L.    , c.    (C.         
) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) may be ordered only with the
victims informed consent as defined in section 5 of P.L.    , c.   
(C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In making the
determination whether to place the defendant on electronic monitoring, the
court shall hold a hearing to consider the defendants potential dangerousness
to the victim and the likelihood that the defendant's participation in
electronic monitoring will deter the defendant from injuring the victim. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) The court shall consider
the following factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   the gravity and seriousness
of harm that the defendant inflicted on the victim in the commission of the
act;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   the defendants previous
history of committing domestic violence, if any; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   the defendants history
of committing crimes, if any;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   whether the defendant
has access to a weapon; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   whether the defendant
has threatened suicide or homicide;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   whether the defendant
has a history of mental illness or has been civilly committed; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   whether the defendant
has a history of alcohol abuse or substance abuse.<sup><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><sup><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>      </span></sup>(2)
In considering the factors set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the
court shall use a risk assessment instrument approved by the Administrative
Director of the Courts. The risk assessment instrument shall be objective,
standardized, and developed based on analysis of empirical data and risk
factors relevant to the risk of whether the defendant will commit a future act
of violence against the victim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c. The court shall order every
defendant placed on electronic monitoring to receive appropriate counseling. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d. (1) Any electronic
monitoring device and tracking system worn or utilized by a defendant pursuant
to P.L.    , c.    (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)
shall be in compliance with Offender Tracking Systems NIJ Standard 1004.00,
issued by the National Institute of Justice in July 2016, and any successor
standards adopted by the National Institute of Justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Any such electronic
monitoring device and tracking system shall be operated by an entity under
contract with the State. The monitoring and tracking system shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) operate 24 hours a day;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) provide notification to
the defendant and the victim when the defendant is within the following
specified distances from the victim: </p>
