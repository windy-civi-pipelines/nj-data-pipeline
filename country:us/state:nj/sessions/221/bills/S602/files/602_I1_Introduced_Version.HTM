Consistent with the OPAs existing immunity provisions, the bill would provide schools and school nurses with immunity from civil and criminal liability, and immunity from professional disciplinary action, in association with any act or omission, which is related to the administration of an opioid antidote, and which is undertaken, in good faith, in accordance with the provisions of the bill and the OPA. The bill would also make several technical amendments to the OPA to correct improper citations and terminological references, and improve clarity.
