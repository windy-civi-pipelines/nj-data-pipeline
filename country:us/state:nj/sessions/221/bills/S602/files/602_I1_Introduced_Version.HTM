<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend the
States Overdose Prevention Act (OPA), P.L.2013, c.46 (C.24:6J-1 et seq.), in
order to authorize school nurses to administer opioid antidotes, with immunity,
to overdose victims who are located on school property, or are engaged in
school-sponsored activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would authorize a
health care practitioner to prescribe or dispense opioid antidotes, through a
standing order, to a school nurse, or to a school that employs a school nurse,
who is deemed by the health care practitioner to be capable of administering
the antidotes to overdose victims in an emergency.  A school nurse acting
pursuant to a standing order would be authorized, in an emergency situation, to
administer an opioid antidote, without fee, to any person on school property,
or to any person engaged in a school-sponsored activity, if the nurse believes,
in good faith, that the person is experiencing an opioid overdose. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Consistent with the OPAs
existing immunity provisions, the bill would provide schools and school nurses
with immunity from civil and criminal liability, and immunity from professional
disciplinary action, in association with any act or omission, which is related
to the administration of an opioid antidote, and which is undertaken, in good
faith, in accordance with the provisions of the bill and the OPA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also make
several technical amendments to the OPA to correct improper citations and
terminological references, and improve clarity.  </p>
