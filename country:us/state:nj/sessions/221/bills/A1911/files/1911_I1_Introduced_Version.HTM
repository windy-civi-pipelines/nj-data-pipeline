certain percentage of law enforcement officers to receive this training.  The
percentage shall be based on the size and responsibilities of each law
enforcement agency and the characteristics of the community, with the goal of
certifying at least 20 percent of law enforcement officers assigned to
uniformed patrol duty.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The Police Training Commission,
in consultation with the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in
the Department of Health, shall develop and maintain relevant curriculums for
the law enforcement training programs required in subsections a. and b. of this
section. Each curriculum shall be reviewed and approved every two years and
modified as appropriate. Each curriculum shall include classroom instruction
and interactive training to assure the most realistic learning experience. The
CIT-NJ curriculum shall adhere to the goals and core elements of the CIT or
other similar evidence-based models. At a minimum, each curriculum shall
include training on:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the cause and nature of
mental illness;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  identifying indicators of
mental illness and the appropriate response in various situations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  conflict resolution and
de-escalation techniques for potentially dangerous situations involving a
mentally ill person;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)    The Department
of Health, in cooperation with local government officials, shall coordinate and
facilitate a Mental Health Services Coordinating Council in each county
comprised of representatives from local law enforcement agencies, correctional
facilities, courts, treatment facilities, county departments of social
services, veterans organizations, hospitals and emergency rooms, and mental
health advocacy groups.  The council periodically shall meet to identify mental
health screening, treatment, and case management resources within each county
that are available to support law enforcement diversion of a person who is
experiencing a mental health crisis.  To the extent feasible, the council shall
develop information sharing technologies to assist law enforcement officers in
promptly identifying available mental health resources to facilitate the
emergent diversion of a person who is experiencing a mental health crisis.</p>

person taken into custody for a crime or offense exhibits behavior that appears
related to a mental health crisis, the law enforcement officer may, with due
regard for the safety of the person, a victim, the public, and the officer,
divert the person to a screening service as defined in section 4 of
P.L.1987&nbsp;c.116 (C.30:4-27.4) or other alternative for mental health
screening and assessment identified by the Department of Health. Following an
evaluation performed by the screening service or other alternative, the officer
shall have discretion, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Attorney
General, in determining whether a criminal complaint shall be filed against the
person. Except for a crime or offense involving violence or when the law
enforcement officer perceives a risk to a victim or the public, there shall be
a presumption to delay or forgo filing a criminal complaint until the person
has received behavioral health treatment services. If a criminal complaint is
not filed due to diversion to a screening service or behavioral health
treatment provider, a law enforcement officer subsequently may file a criminal
complaint, subject to the time limitations of N.J.S.2C:1-6, if the person fails
to cooperate with the screening service or treatment provider, or commits a

legal counsel, or at the prosecutors own discretion, may approve the diversion
of a defendant to a mental health screening service or behavioral health
treatment service.  After the prosecutor has approved the diversion, the
prosecutor shall motion the court to postpone proceedings while the defendant
participates in mental health screening or treatment services. The court may
grant the postponement of proceedings and release the defendant on the

Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) regarding a screening service
and its staff that effectuate the following purposes and procedures:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    A screening service
shall serve as the facility in the public mental health care treatment system
wherein a person believed to be in need of involuntary commitment to outpatient
treatment, a short-term care facility, psychiatric facility or special
psychiatric hospital undergoes an assessment to determine what mental health
services are appropriate for the person and where those services may be most
appropriately provided in the least restrictive environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The screening service may
provide emergency and consensual treatment to the person receiving the
assessment and may transport the person or detain the person up to 24 hours for
the purposes of providing the treatment and conducting the assessment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    When a person assessed
by a mental health screener and involuntary commitment to treatment seems
necessary, the screener shall provide, on a screening document prescribed by
the division, information regarding the persons history and available
alternative facilities and services that are deemed inappropriate for the
person. When appropriate and available, and as permitted by law, the screener
shall make reasonable efforts to gather information from the person's family or
significant others for the purposes of preparing the screening document.  If a
psychiatrist, in consideration of this document and in conjunction with the
psychiatrist's own complete assessment, concludes that the person is in need of
commitment to treatment, the psychiatrist shall complete the screening
certificate.  The screening certificate shall be completed by a psychiatrist
except in those circumstances where the division's contract with the screening
service provides that another physician may complete the certificate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon completion of the
screening certificate, screening service staff shall determine, in consultation
with the psychiatrist or another physician, as appropriate, the least
restrictive environment for the appropriate treatment to which the person shall
be assigned or admitted, taking into account the person's prior history of
hospitalization and treatment and the person's current mental health
condition.  Screening service staff shall designate:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  inpatient treatment for
the person if he is immediately or imminently dangerous or if outpatient
treatment is deemed inadequate to render the person unlikely to be dangerous to
self, others or property within the reasonably foreseeable future; and</p>

the person when outpatient treatment is deemed sufficient to render the person
unlikely to be dangerous to self, others or property within the reasonably
foreseeable future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the screening service staff
determines that the person is in need of involuntary commitment to outpatient
treatment, the screening service staff shall consult with an outpatient
treatment provider to arrange, if possible, for an appropriate interim plan of
outpatient treatment in accordance with section 9 of P.L.2009, c.112
(C.30:4-27.8a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a person has been admitted
three times or has been an inpatient for 60 days at a short-term care facility
during the preceding 12 months, consideration shall be given to not placing the
person in a short-term care facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The person shall be admitted
to the appropriate facility or assigned to the appropriate outpatient treatment
provider, as appropriate for treatment, as soon as possible.  Screening service
staff are authorized to coordinate initiation of outpatient treatment or
transport the person or arrange for transportation of the person to the
appropriate facility.</p>

to the screening service for an assessment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires uniformed
law enforcement officers assigned to patrol duty to complete a one day
in-service training program adopted by the Police Training Commission (PTC) in
the Department of Law and Public Safety to provide them with the skills and
knowledge necessary to recognize and respond to a person experiencing a mental
health crisis, and when appropriate, divert that person from the criminal
justice system. These law enforcement officers are required by the bill to
complete an in-service refresher course at least once every five years
thereafter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the PTC
to adopt the Crisis Intervention Team  New Jersey Center for Excellence
Program (CIT-NJ), the States county-based 40-hour training and certification
program modelled on the national Crisis Intervention Team Center of Excellence
Program (CIT).  CIT-NJ is designed to provide the skills, knowledge, and
support systems necessary to divert persons experiencing a mental health crisis
from the criminal justice system into behavioral health treatment services;
improve law enforcement response to persons experiencing a mental health
crisis; and protect the safety of first responders, the person in crisis, and
the public.  The program is to require a certain percentage of law enforcement
officers, with a goal of 20 percent, to receive this training based on the size
and responsibilities of the law enforcement agency and the particular
characteristics of the community.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the PTC is to
consult with the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the
Department of Health (DOH), to develop and maintain relevant curriculums for
the law enforcement training programs established by the bill. The curricula
are to be reviewed and approved every two years and modified as appropriate.
They are to include classroom instruction and interactive training to assure
realistic learning experiences.  At a minimum, each curriculum shall include
training on: (1) the cause and nature of mental illness; (2) how to identify
indicators of mental illness and appropriately respond in a variety of common
situations; (3) conflict resolution and de-escalation techniques for
potentially dangerous situations involving mentally ill persons; (4) use of
appropriate language when interacting with mentally ill persons; (5)
alternatives to lethal force when interacting with potentially dangerous
mentally ill; and (6) community and State resources available to serve mentally
ill persons and how they can be best utilized by law enforcement to benefit the
community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the DOH, in
conjunction with local government officials, to coordinate and facilitate a
Mental Health Services Coordinating Council in each county to identify mental
health screening, treatment, and case management resources within each county
available to support law enforcement diversion for persons experiencing a
mental health crisis. The councils are to include representatives of local law
enforcement agencies, correctional facilities, courts, treatment facilities,
county departments of social services, veterans organizations, hospitals and
emergency rooms, and mental health advocacy groups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a person taken into custody
for a crime or offense exhibits behavior that appears related to a mental health
crisis, the law enforcement officer is authorized to, with due regard for the
safety of the person, a victim, the public, and the officer, divert the person
to a screening service or other alternative for mental health screening and
assessment identified by the DOH.  The screening service is responsible for
providing referrals through personal contact to the most appropriate, least
restrictive treatment setting indicated, linkage and follow-up to maintain
contact with the person until the person is engaged with another behavior
health service or the person is no longer experiencing a mental health crisis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The officer has discretion in
determining whether a criminal complaint should be filed against the person who
received the evaluation.  There is to be a preference to delay or forego the
filing of a criminal complaint until the person has had the opportunity to
receive behavioral health treatment services, unless the crime or offense
involved violence or the officer perceives a risk to a victim or the public. 
The officer subsequently may file a criminal complaint against a diverted
person if the person fails to cooperate with the screening service or treatment
provider, or commits another crime or offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also authorizes the
county prosecutors to approve diversion of a defendant any time after the
filing, but before disposition, of the complaint to a mental health screening
service or behavioral health treatment service. Court proceedings are to be
postponed pending the defendants treatment.  Defendants charged with a crime
involving violence are not eligible for diversion and there is a presumption
against diversion for defendants charged with certain serious crimes.  The
court is to review the defendants case every six months.  Charges may be
dismissed if certain conditions are met by the defendant and charges may be
reinstated if any conditions are not met.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The DOH also is required by
the bill to develop and implement any pilot program needed to improve response
times when a law enforcement officer requests assistance in intervening with a
person experiencing a mental health crisis and to expand availability of mental
health screening services in emergent situations.</p>
