<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would ensure greater
tax fairness between the owners of gas powered vehicles and electric vehicles. 
Namely, the bill would establish an additional annual registration fee for
electric vehicles, provide for a reduction in the State tax on highway fuels
under both the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts (PPGR) Tax and the Motor Fuels
Tax, and require the Department of Transportation to study and make
recommendations concerning the dedication of alternative sources of revenue to
the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Additional Annual Registration
Fee for Electric Vehicles</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill first requires the
Chief Administrator (chief administrator) of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle
Commission to impose and collect an additional annual registration fee for each
passenger and commercial electric vehicle in the State.  Under the bill, the
amount of the additional annual registration fee would be $300 for each
passenger electric vehicle and $450 for each commercial electric vehicle during
the fiscal years beginning on and after July 1, 2025.  Notably, the bill
requires all revenues derived from these additional registration fees to be
collected by the chief administrator and remitted to the State Treasurer for
deposit into the TTF.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Reduction of Highway Fuel Taxes</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Next, the bill would enact a
33 percent reduction in the taxes imposed on highway fuels under both the Motor
Fuel Tax and the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax (PPGRT), collectively
referred to as the gas tax, beginning with State Fiscal Year 2025.  The bill
would also permanently extend the procedure by which the rate of tax imposed on
highway fuels under the PPGRT is calculated.  Currently, the Motor Fuel Tax is
fixed at 10.5 cents for gasoline and 13.5 cents for diesel fuel, and the PPGR
tax is set at 31.8 cents for gasoline and 35.8 cents for diesel fuel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Motor Fuel Tax on gasoline
would be lowered from 10.5 cents to 7 cents per gallon, and the motor fuel tax
on diesel would be lowered from 13.5 cents to 9 cents per gallon.  The motor
fuel tax on liquefied petroleum gas would likewise be lowered from 5.25 cents
per gallon to 3.5 cents given that the tax rate for these products are set at
one-half of the tax imposed on gasoline.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the tax
rate imposed on highway fuels under the PPGRT is annually adjusted by the State
Treasurer to ensure that the State realizes a statutorily prescribed revenue
target.  All revenues collected are deposited into the TTF to support
transportation infrastructure projects and debt service on transportation
bonds.  This annual adjustment mechanism is currently set to expire at the conclusion
of State Fiscal Year 2026.  This bill would permanently extend this annual
adjustment mechanism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also reduces the rate
of tax imposed on highway fuels under the PPGRT by lowering the statutorily
prescribed revenue target, also referred to as the highway fuel cap amount, by
33 percent.  The highway fuel cap amount is based on State Fiscal Year 2016 sum
of: (1) the taxes collected on the 12.48 percent and four cent tax rates for
highway fuels taxes, (2) the amount derived from taxing the gallonage of
highway fuel subject to the four cent motor fuel tax, and (3) the amount that
would have been derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to
the motor fuel tax at a rate of 23 cents per gallon.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To ensure adequate funding for
the TTF, the bill would require the State to annually appropriate from the
General Fund such amounts as are necessary from the revenues collected under
the Sales and Use Tax Act, P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) into the TTF
to support all debt service obligations of the Transportation Trust Fund
Authoritys (TTFA) for the current year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires the
Department of Transportation (department), in consultation with the TTFA and
the Office of Revenue and Economic Analysis in the Department of the Treasury,
to study and make recommendations and a repot concerning the dedication of
alternative sources of revenue to the TTF.  These revenues may be necessary to
offset future revenue reductions from the Motor Fuels Tax (MFT) and the
Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax (PPGRT) due to the decreased consumption
of gasoline, diesel, and other highway fuels.  The purpose of this study will
be to identify one or more sources of revenue, other than the Motor Fuels Tax
and the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax, that may be relied upon to fund
the TTF in future years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At a minimum, the report would
be required to: (1) analyze the feasibility of dedicating alternative sources
of revenue to the TTF; and (2) make recommendations for the dedication of
