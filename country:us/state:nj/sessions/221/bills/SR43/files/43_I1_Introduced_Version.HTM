SR43 SENATE RESOLUTION No. 43 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  JOHN F. MCKEON District 27 (Essex and Passaic) Senator  RAJ MUKHERJI District 32 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS Urges Governor to impose moratorium on fossil fuel projects. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Senate Resolution urging the Governor to impose a moratorium on fossil fuel projects. Whereas, Climate change is threatening present and future generations with severe economic and environmental consequences; and Whereas, Emerging evidence indicates that growth in greenhouse gas levels leads to climate change, with rising temperatures resulting in higher sea levels and associated coastal flooding, more frequent wildfires, longer periods of drought, and an increase in the number and intensity of storms; and Whereas, A greenhouse gas is an atmospheric gas that slows the rate at which heat radiates into space resulting in a warming effect on the earths temperature; and Whereas, The extraction and combustion of fossil fuels, which includes coal, oil, and natural gas, are significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions and major contributors to climate change; and Whereas, Unlike energy generated from fossil fuels, renewable energy generated from renewable sources such as sunlight, wind, and rain, does not produce greenhouse gas emissions and is often described as  clean energy because of its minimal impact on the environment; and Whereas, Governor Murphys draft Energy Master Plan sets a goal to provide 100 percent clean energy in the State of New Jersey by 2050, however, the plan does not address the existing and proposed numerous fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as pipelines and power plants in the State; and Whereas, In order to meet the States clean energy goal by 2050 an immediate moratorium on all fossil fuel infrastructure projects should be imposed until the State adopts a plan to meet this goal; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House urges the Governor to impose an immediate moratorium on fossil fuel infrastructure projects until the State adopts rules regulating CO2 and other climate pollutants adequate to achieve the 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2006 levels by 2050 as required under the Global Warming Response Act. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the State of New Jersey.
