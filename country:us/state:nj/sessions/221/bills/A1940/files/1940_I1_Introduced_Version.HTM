and Spanish by law enforcement officers, the current law simply states that it
shall be written in a notice.  The bill would specifically assign
responsibility for the written materials to the Attorney General and, as
previously mentioned, the writing would be made available in English and
Spanish, and up to 10 additional high demand languages spoken in the State. </span></p>

courts, a domestic violence victim is currently permitted to file a domestic
violence complaint seeking a temporary restraining order with the Superior
Court, Chancery Division, Family Part or, at times when the Family Part is
closed, with a judge of the Family Part or judge of the municipal court
assigned to accept such complaints and issue a temporary order.  <u>See</u>
section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-28).  To assist these courts as well as
law enforcement regarding the issuance of the orders and their service on the
alleged abuser, the AOC would prepare standard templates in English, Spanish,
and other high demand languages identified in its Language Access Plan, as
approved by the Supreme Court, to be provided to the victim and defendant.  </span></p>
