<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><sup><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>1</span></sup></b><b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>1.  Section 5
of P.L.1996, c.138 (C.18A:7F-5) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    As used in this section,
&quot;cost of living&quot; means the CPI as defined in section 3 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-45).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Within 30 days
following the approval of the Educational Adequacy Report, the commissioner
shall notify each district of the base per pupil amount, the per pupil amounts
for full-day preschool, the weights for grade level, county vocational school
districts, at-risk pupils, bilingual pupils, and combination pupils, the cost
coefficients for security aid and for transportation aid, the State average
classification rate and the excess cost for general special education services
pupils, the State average classification rate and the excess cost for
speech-only pupils, and the geographic cost adjustment for each of the school
years to which the report is applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Annually, within two days
following the transmittal of the State budget message to the Legislature by the
Governor pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1944, c.112 (C.52:27B-20), the
commissioner shall notify each district of the maximum amount of aid payable to
the district in the succeeding school year pursuant to the provisions of
P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.), and shall notify each district of the
district's adequacy budget for the succeeding school year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the 2008-2009 school year
and thereafter, unless otherwise specified within P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.), aid amounts payable for the budget year shall be based on budget year
pupil counts, which shall be projected by the commissioner using data from
prior years.  Adjustments for the actual pupil counts of the budget year shall
be made to State aid amounts payable during the school year succeeding the budget
year.  Additional amounts payable shall be reflected as revenue and an account
receivable for the budget year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of this act to the contrary, each district's State aid payable for
the 2008-2009 school year, with the exception of aid for school facilities
projects, shall be based on simulations employing the various formulas and
State aid amounts contained in P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.).  The
commissioner shall prepare a report dated December 12, 2007 reflecting the
State aid amounts payable by category for each district and shall submit the
report to the Legislature prior to the adoption of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.).  Except as otherwise provided pursuant to this subsection and
paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 5 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-47),
the amounts contained in the commissioner's report shall be the final amounts
payable and shall not be subsequently adjusted other than to reflect the
phase-in of the required general fund local levy pursuant to paragraph (4) of
subsection b. of section 16 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-58) and to reflect
school choice aid to which a district may be entitled pursuant to section 20 of
that act. The projected pupil counts and equalized valuations used for the
calculation of State aid shall also be used for the calculation of adequacy
budget, local share, and required local share.  For 2008-2009, extraordinary
special education State aid shall be included as a projected amount in the
commissioner's report dated December 12, 2007 pending the final approval of
applications for the aid.  If the actual award of extraordinary special
education State aid is greater than the projected amount, the district shall
receive the increase in the aid payable in the subsequent school year pursuant
to the provisions of subsection c. of section 13 of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-55).  If the actual award of extraordinary special education State
aid is less than the projected amount, other State aid categories shall be
adjusted accordingly so that the district shall not receive less State aid than
as provided in accordance with the provisions of sections 5 and 16 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-47 and C.18A:7F-58).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event that the
commissioner determines, following the enactment of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-43 et al.) but prior to the issuance of State aid notices for the
2008-2009 school year, that a significant district-specific change in data
warrants an increase in State aid for that district, the commissioner may
adjust the State aid amount provided for the district in the December 12, 2007
report to reflect the increase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Each district shall have
a required local share.  For districts that receive educational adequacy aid
pursuant to subsection b. of section 16 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-58), the
required local share shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of
that subsection.</p>
