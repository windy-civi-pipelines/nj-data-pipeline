Act, and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    Despite existing State
and federal laws and regulations to protect consumers from certain surprise
out-of-network charges, additional disclosures are needed to ensure
transparency when accessing healthcare from out-of-State health care facilities
and health care providers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Out-of-network charges
continue to pose problems for health care consumers who access health care
services in New Jersey but are then transferred or referred to health care
facilities or providers located outside the State of New Jersey.  Many
consumers are surprised to receive bills for hospital procedures or for charges
from providers after receiving out-of-State care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    Therefore, it is in the
public interest to enhance consumer protections by ensuring consumers are
empowered to make appropriate health care choices for themselves and their
families prior to being transferred or referred to health care facilities or
health care providers located outside the State of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.   Notwithstanding any
provision of law to the contrary, prior to obtaining consent to transfer a
patient to a health care facility located outside the State, the health care
professional seeking to transfer the patient to an out-of-State health care
facility shall provide the patient, in writing and in a manner that is easily
understood, the following information, the provision of which shall be
documented in the patient record:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the patients right to
receive medical care at a health care facility of the patients choosing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  the clinical basis for
the patients proposed transfer to a health care facility located outside the
State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  the availability of
clinically-appropriate services at health care facilities within the State or a
determination no such clinically-appropriate services are available in the
State; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  the location of the
out-of-State facility; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  in the case of a:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   trauma-related
diagnosis, a determination as to why the patient is not being transferred to a
Level 1 or Level 2 trauma center in the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  stroke-related diagnosis,
a determination as to why the patient is not being transferred to a designated
certified comprehensive or primary stroke center in the State; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   cardiovascular-related
diagnosis, a determination as to why the patient is not being transferred to a
licensed New Jersey cardiac surgery center; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  if the health care
facility is affiliated with the out-of-State facility, the nature of the
relationship between the facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the patient is unconscious
or otherwise lacks the capacity to make health care decisions, the health care
professional shall provide the information to the patients designated next of
kin, patient advocate, or legally authorized representative, as appropriate;
except that, if the patients designated next of kin, patient advocate, or
legally authorized representative is unknown or if it is determined, after best
efforts to contact the designated next of kin, patient advocate, or legally
authorized representative, that the designated next of kin, patient advocate,
or legally authorized representative is unavailable, the requirement to provide
the information required pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed to be
waived and the transfer of the patient to the out-of-State facility shall be
deemed to be authorized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)   Prior to
transferring the patient to a health care facility located outside the State, a
health care facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.)
shall notify the patients health insurance carrier or self-funded health
benefits plan sponsor of the pending transfer and facilitate communication
between the patient and the patients insurance carrier concerning: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   the network status of
the health care facility located outside the State and whether the specific
medical services provided by that health care facility are covered under the
patients health benefits plan; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  any estimated
out-of-pocket costs the patient would incur as the result of being transferred
to a health care facility located outside the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  A health care facility
that is unable to notify a patients health insurance carrier or self-funded
health benefits plan sponsor shall be deemed in compliance with paragraph (1)
of this subsection if a health care professional who determines it is necessary
to transfer a patient to a health care facility outside the State certifies
that the notification required pursuant to subsection a. of this section has
been made.  If the patient is unconscious or otherwise lacks the capacity to
make health care decisions, the health care professional shall certify that the
notification was provided to the patients designated next of kin, patient
advocate, or legally authorized representative, as applicable, or that the
patients designated next of kin, patient advocate, or legally authorized

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, designated as the
Patient Protection Act, requires that, prior to obtaining consent to transfer
a patient to a health care facility located outside the State, the health care
professional seeking to transfer the patient to an out-of-State facility is to
provide the patient, in writing and in a manner that is easily understood, the
following information, which is to be documented in the patient record: the
patients right to receive medical care at a health care facility of the
patients choosing; the clinical basis for the patients proposed transfer to
an out-of-State facility; the availability of clinically-appropriate services
at health care facilities within the State or a determination that no such
clinically-appropriate services are available in the State; in the case of a
trauma-related, stroke-related, or cardiovascular-related diagnosis, a
determination as to why the patient is not being transferred to a Level 1 or
Level 2 trauma center, designated certified comprehensive or primary stroke
center, or a licensed cardiac surgery center in the State, as appropriate; and
if the health care facility is affiliated with the out-of-State facility, the
nature of the relationship between the facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, <span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>if a patient is unconscious or otherwise lacks the
capacity to make health care decisions, the health care professional who is
required to provide the information is to provide the information to the
patients designated next of kin, patient advocate, or legally authorized
representative, as appropriate.  If the designated next of kin, patient
advocate, or legally authorized representative is unknown or is unavailable
after best efforts to contact that individual, the requirement to provide the
information will be deemed to be waived and the transfer of the patient to the
out-of-State facility will be deemed to be authorized.  The bill provides that,
in the event that notice cannot be provided to the patients health benefits
plan prior to the transfer, the health care professional who is required to
provide the notice is to certify that the required information was provided to
the patients designated next-of-kin, patient advocate, or legally authorized
representative, or that such individual was unknown or unavailable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the health care

State and whether the specific medical services provided by that health care
facility are covered under the patients health benefits plan; and any
estimated out-of-pocket costs the patient would incur as the result of being
transferred to a health care facility located outside the State.  The facility
will additionally be required to provide notice to the Department of Health
(DOH), on a quarterly basis and in a form and manner to be determined by the
DOH, of each transfer to a health care facility located outside the State and
the clinical necessity or other reason for the transfer.</p>

facility that transfers a patient to an out-of-State health care facility
without an opportunity to notify the patients health insurance carrier is to
be required to certify that the patient notice requirements under the bill have
been met. </p>

patients right to receive medical care from a health care professional or
facility of the patients choosing; the clinical basis for the patients
proposed referral to an out-of-State health care professional or health care
facility; the location of the out-of-State health care professionals office or
the location of the out-of-State facility; whether clinically-appropriate
services from an in-State health care professional or facility are available;
and, if the referring health care professional is affiliated with the
out-of-State health care professional or health care facility to whom the
patient is to be referred, the nature of the relationship between the two
professionals or the professional and the facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the health care
professional is to notify the DOH, on a quarterly basis, of each referral and
the clinical necessity or other reasons for the referral.  The DOH is to then
forward each such notification to the Division of Consumer Affairs (Division)
in the Department of Law and Public Safety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill mandates DOH and the
Division, as applicable, to post on their respective Internet websites
information, and update at least annually, the number of: patients transferred
by each health care facility to an out-of-State health care facility and the
services provided to those patients; the number of patients referred by
in-State health care professionals to out-of-State health care professionals or
health care facilities by specialty and the clinical basis for patient
transfers and referrals; and the number of complaints received by DOH or the
Division regarding patient transfers to out-of-State health care facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also stipulates that,
in the case of a patient in need of pediatric care, a health care facility or a
health care professional providing such services would be exempt from the
requirements of the bill.</p>
