possession of that purchased firearm <u>, ammunition, firearm accessory, or

surrendered no later than 10 business days after the order is entered. Any card

listing the date of surrender, the name of the defendant, and any item that has
been surrendered, including <u>, as appropriate,</u> the serial number,

prosecutor, finds probable cause that the defendant has failed to surrender any
firearm<u>, ammunition, firearm accessory, firearm component</u>, card, or
permit, the court may order a search for and removal of these items at any
location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe these items are

satisfied that exigent circumstances exist sufficient to excuse the failure of
the applicant to appear personally and that sufficient grounds for granting the

determine. Compensatory losses shall include, but not be limited to, loss of
earnings or other support, including child or spousal support, out-of-pocket
losses for injuries sustained, cost of repair or replacement of real or
personal property damaged or destroyed or taken by the defendant, cost of
