Section 5 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-21) is amended to read as follows: 5. a.  When a person claims to be a victim of domestic violence, and where a law enforcement officer responding to the incident finds probable cause to believe that domestic violence has occurred, the law enforcement officer shall arrest the person who is alleged to be the person who subjected the victim to domestic violence and shall sign a criminal complaint if: (1) The victim exhibits signs of injury caused by an act of domestic violence; (2) A warrant is in effect; (3) There is probable cause to believe that the person has violated N.J.S.2C:29-9, and there is probable cause to believe that the person has been served with the order alleged to have been violated.  If the victim does not have a copy of a purported order, the officer may verify the existence of an order with the appropriate law enforcement agency; or (4) There is probable cause to believe that a weapon as defined in N.J.S.2C:39-1 has been involved in the commission of an act of domestic violence. b.   A law enforcement officer may arrest a person; or may sign a criminal complaint against that person, or may do both, where there is probable cause to believe that an act of domestic violence has been committed, but where none of the conditions in subsection a. of this section applies. c. (1) As used in this section, the word exhibits is to be liberally construed to mean any indication that a victim has suffered bodily injury, which shall include physical pain or any impairment of physical condition.  Where the victim exhibits no visible sign of injury, but states that an injury has occurred, the officer should consider other relevant factors in determining whether there is probable cause to make an arrest. (2) In determining which party in a domestic violence incident is the victim where both parties exhibit signs of injury, the officer should consider the comparative extent of the injuries, the history of domestic violence between the parties, if any, and any other relevant factors. (3) No victim shall be denied relief or arrested or charged under this act with an offense because the victim used reasonable force in self defense against domestic violence by an attacker. d. (1) In addition to a law enforcement officers authority to seize any weapon that is contraband, evidence or an instrumentality of crime, a law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe that an act of domestic violence has been committed shall: (a) question persons present to determine whether there are weapons on the premises; and (b) upon observing or learning that a weapon is present on the premises, seize any weapon that the officer reasonably believes would expose the victim to a risk of serious bodily injury.  If a law enforcement officer seizes any firearm pursuant to this paragraph, the officer shall also seize any ammunition, or firearm accessory, or firearm component as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, and any firearm purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun issued to the person accused of the act of domestic violence. (2) A law enforcement officer shall deliver all weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, firearm components, firearms purchaser identification cards and permits to purchase a handgun seized pursuant to this section to the county prosecutor and shall append an inventory of all seized items to the domestic violence report. (3) Weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components seized in accordance with the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991, P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.) shall be returned to the owner except upon order of the Superior Court.  The prosecutor who has possession of the seized weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components may, upon notice to the owner, petition a judge of the Family Part of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, within 45 days of seizure, to obtain title to the seized weapons, or to revoke any and all permits, licenses and other authorizations for the use, possession, or ownership of such weapons pursuant to the law governing such use, possession, or ownership, or may object to the return of the weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components on such grounds as are provided for the initial rejection or later revocation of the authorizations, or on the grounds that the owner is unfit or that the owner poses a threat to the public in general or a person or persons in particular. A hearing shall be held and a record made thereof within 45 days of the notice provided above.  No formal pleading and no filing fee shall be required as a preliminary to such hearing.  The hearing shall be summary in nature.  Appeals from the results of the hearing shall be to the Superior Court, Appellate Division, in accordance with the law. If the prosecutor does not institute an action within 45 days of seizure, the seized weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components shall be returned to the owner. After the hearing the court shall order the return of the firearms, weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, firearm components, and any authorization papers relating to the seized weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components to the owner if the court determines the owner is not subject to any of the disabilities set forth in subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:58-3 and finds that the complaint has been dismissed at the request of the complainant and the prosecutor determines that there is insufficient probable cause to indict; or if the defendant is found not guilty of the charges; or if the court determines that the domestic violence situation no longer exists.  At least 10 days prior to returning the seized weapons, the prosecutor shall notify each claimant or victim that the weapons will be returned to the owner. Nothing in this act shall impair the right of the State to retain evidence pending a criminal prosecution.  Nor shall any provision of this act be construed to limit the authority of the State or a law enforcement officer to seize, retain or forfeit property pursuant to chapter 64 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes. If, after the hearing, the court determines that the weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components are not to be returned to the owner, the court may: (a) With respect to weapons other than firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components, order the prosecutor to dispose of the weapons if the owner does not arrange for the transfer or sale of the weapons to an appropriate person within 60 days; or (b) Order the revocation of the owners firearms purchaser identification card or any permit, license or authorization, in which case the court shall order the owner to surrender any firearm, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components seized and all other firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components possessed to the prosecutor and shall order the prosecutor to dispose of the firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components if the owner does not arrange for the sale of the firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components to a registered dealer of the firearms within 60 days; or (c) Order such other relief as it may deem appropriate.  When the court orders the weapons, firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components forfeited to the State or the prosecutor is required to dispose of the weapons, the prosecutor shall dispose of the property as provided in N.J.S.2C:64-6. (4) A civil suit may be brought to enjoin a wrongful failure to return a seized firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component where the prosecutor refuses to return the [weapon] firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component after receiving a written request to do so and notice of the owners intent to bring a civil action pursuant to this section.  Failure of the prosecutor to comply with the provisions of this act shall entitle the prevailing party in the civil suit to reasonable costs, including attorneys fees, provided that the court finds that the prosecutor failed to act in good faith in retaining the seized weapon. (5) No law enforcement officer or agency shall be held liable in any civil action brought by any person for failing to learn of, locate or seize a weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component pursuant to this act, or for returning a seized weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component to its owner. (cf: P.L.2021, c.358, s.1) 3. Section 10 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-26) is amended to read as follows: 10. a.  When a defendant charged with a crime or offense involving domestic violence is released from custody before trial on bail or personal recognizance, the court authorizing the release may as a condition of release issue an order prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with the victim including, but not limited to, restraining the defendant from entering the victims residence, place of employment or business, or school, and from harassing or stalking the victim or the victims friends, co-workers, or relatives in any way.  If the victim is pregnant, at the victims request the court may order that the victims child shall, immediately upon birth, be included in the order.  The court may also enter an order prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household.  In addition, the court may enter an order directing the possession of the animal and providing that the animal shall not be disposed of prior to the disposition of the crime or offense.  The court may enter an order prohibiting the defendant from possessing any firearm, ammunition, or firearm accessory or firearm component as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:29-1, or [other] weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and ordering the search for and seizure of any such weapon at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe the weapon is located.  The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and scope of the search and seizure authorized by the order. b.   The written court order releasing the defendant shall contain the courts directives specifically restricting the defendants ability to have contact with the victim, the victims friends, co-workers, or relatives, or any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household.  The prosecutor shall provide a copy of this order to the victim forthwith. c.   The victims location shall remain confidential and shall not appear on any documents or records to which the defendant has access. d.   Before bail is set, the defendants prior record shall be considered by the court. The court shall also conduct a search of the domestic violence central registry.  Bail shall be set as soon as is feasible, but in all cases within 24 hours of arrest. e.   Once bail is set it shall not be reduced without prior notice to the county prosecutor and the victim.  Bail shall not be reduced by a judge other than the judge who originally ordered bail, unless the reasons for the amount of the original bail are available to the judge who reduces the bail and are set forth in the record. f.    A victim shall not be prohibited from applying for, and a court shall not be prohibited from issuing, temporary restraints pursuant to this act because the victim has charged any person with commission of a criminal act. (cf: P.L.2023, c.239, s.1) 4. Section 11 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-27) is amended to read as follows: 11. a.  When a defendant is found guilty of a crime or offense involving domestic violence and a condition of sentence restricts the defendants ability to have contact with the victim, the victims friends, co-workers, or relatives, or an animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household, that condition shall be recorded in an order of the court and a written copy of that order shall be provided to the victim by the clerk of the court or other person designated by the court.  If the victim is pregnant, at the victims request the court may order that the victims child shall, immediately upon birth, be included in the order.  In addition to restricting a defendants ability to have contact with the victim, the victims friends, co-workers, or relatives, or an animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household, the court may require the defendant to receive professional counseling from either a private source or a source appointed by the court, and if the court so orders, the court shall require the defendant to provide documentation of attendance at the professional counseling.  In any case where the court order contains a requirement that the defendant receive professional counseling, no application by the defendant to dissolve the restraining order shall be granted unless, in addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions ordered by the court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at such counseling. b.   In addition the court may enter an order directing the possession of an animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household.  Where a person has abused or threatened to abuse such animal, there shall be a presumption that possession of the animal shall be awarded to the non-abusive party. c. (1)  When a defendant is found guilty of a crime or offense involving domestic violence, the court shall inform the defendant that the defendant is prohibited from purchasing, owning, possessing, or controlling a firearm or ammunition pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1979, c.179 (C.2C:39-7), or firearm accessories or firearm components as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and from receiving or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3.  The court shall order the defendant to arrange for the immediate surrender to a law enforcement officer of any firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component that has not already been seized or surrendered and any firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun possessed by the defendant.  No later than five business days after the order is entered, however, the defendant may arrange to sell any surrendered firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component to a licensed retail dealer of firearms who shall be authorized to take possession of that purchased firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component from the law enforcement agency to which it was surrendered no later than 10 business days after the order is entered.  Any card or permit issued to the defendant shall be deemed immediately revoked.  The court shall establish a process for notifying the appropriate authorities of the conviction requiring the revocation of the card or permit.  A law enforcement officer accepting a surrendered firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component shall provide the defendant with a receipt listing the date of surrender, the name of the defendant, and any item that has been surrendered, including, as appropriate, the serial number, manufacturer, and model of the surrendered firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component.  The defendant shall provide a copy of this receipt to the prosecutor within 48 hours of service of the order, and shall attest under penalty that any firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components owned or possessed at the time of the order have been transferred in accordance with this section and that the defendant currently does not possess any [firearms] of these items.  The defendant alternatively may attest under penalty that he did not own or possess a firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component at the time of the order and currently does not possess a firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component.  If the court, upon motion of the prosecutor, finds probable cause that the defendant has failed to surrender any firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, firearm component, card, or permit, the court may order a search for and removal of these items at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe these items are located.  The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and the scope of the search and seizure authorized by the order. (2) A law enforcement officer who receives a firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component that is surrendered, but not purchased and taken possession of by a licensed retail dealer of firearms within 10 business days of when the order is entered pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, may dispose of the surrendered firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.2C:64-6.  A firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component purchased by a licensed retail dealer from a defendant shall become part of the inventory of the dealer. (cf: P.L.2023, c.239, s.2) 5. Section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-28) is amended to read as follows: 12. a.  A victim may file a complaint alleging the commission of an act of domestic violence with the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court in conformity with the Rules of Court.  The court shall not dismiss any complaint or delay disposition of a case because the victim has left the residence to avoid further incidents of domestic violence.  Filing a complaint pursuant to this section shall not prevent the filing of a criminal complaint for the same act. On weekends, holidays and other times when the court is closed, a victim may file a complaint before a judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court or a municipal court judge who shall be assigned to accept complaints and issue emergency, ex parte relief in the form of temporary restraining orders pursuant to this act. A plaintiff may apply for relief under this section in a court having jurisdiction over the place where the alleged act of domestic violence occurred, where the defendant resides, or where the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and the court shall follow the same procedures applicable to other emergency applications.  Criminal complaints filed pursuant to this act shall be investigated and prosecuted in the jurisdiction where the offense is alleged to have occurred.  Contempt complaints filed pursuant to N.J.S.2C:29-9 shall be prosecuted in the county where the contempt is alleged to have been committed and a copy of the contempt complaint shall be forwarded to the court that issued the order alleged to have been violated. b.   The court shall waive any requirement that the petitioners place of residence appear on the complaint. c. (1)  The clerk of the court, or other person designated by the court, shall assist the parties in completing any forms necessary for the filing of a summons, complaint, answer or other pleading. (2) The plaintiff may provide information concerning firearms1, ammunition, or firearm accessories or firearm components as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1,1 to which the defendant has access, including the location of these firearms 1and related items1, if known, on a form to be prescribed by the Administrative Director of the Courts. (3) Information provided by the plaintiff concerning firearms, ammunition, or firearm accessories or firearm components as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, to which the defendant has access shall be kept confidential and shall not be disseminated or disclosed, provided that nothing in this subsection shall prohibit dissemination or disclosure of this information in a manner consistent with and in furtherance of the purpose for which the information was provided. d.   Summons and complaint forms shall be readily available at the clerks office, at the municipal courts and at municipal and State police stations. e.   As soon as the domestic violence complaint is filed, both the victim and the abuser shall be advised of any programs or services available for advice and counseling. f.    A plaintiff may seek emergency, ex parte relief in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A municipal court judge or a judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court may enter an ex parte order when necessary to protect the life, health or well-being of a victim on whose behalf the relief is sought. g.   If it appears that the plaintiff is in danger of domestic violence, the judge shall, upon consideration of the plaintiffs domestic violence complaint, order emergency ex parte relief, in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A decision shall be made by the judge regarding the emergency relief forthwith. h. (1)  A judge may issue a temporary restraining order upon sworn testimony or complaint of an applicant who is not physically present, pursuant to court rules, or by a person who represents a person who is physically or mentally incapable of filing personally.  A temporary restraining order may be issued if the judge is satisfied that exigent circumstances exist sufficient to excuse the failure of the applicant to appear personally and that sufficient grounds for granting the application have been shown. (2) The Administrative Office of the Court shall prepare standard templates for temporary restraining orders in English, Spanish, and the other high-demand languages identified in its Language Access Plan as approved by the Supreme Court.  These templates shall be available for law enforcement, judges of the Municipal Court, and judges and staff of the Superior Court to provide to the victim and defendant when issuing temporary restraining orders pursuant to this section. i.    An order for emergency, ex parte relief shall be granted upon good cause shown and shall remain in effect until a judge of the Family Part issues a further order.  Any temporary order hereunder is immediately appealable for a plenary hearing de novo not on the record before any judge of the Family Part of the county in which the plaintiff resides or is sheltered if that judge issued the temporary order or has access to the reasons for the issuance of the temporary order and sets forth in the record the reasons for the modification or dissolution.  The denial of a temporary restraining order by a municipal court judge and subsequent administrative dismissal of the complaint shall not bar the victim from refiling a complaint in the Family Part based on the same incident and receiving an emergency, ex parte hearing de novo not on the record before a Family Part judge, and every denial of relief by a municipal court judge shall so state. j.    Emergency relief may include forbidding the defendant from returning to the scene of the domestic violence, forbidding the defendant from possessing any firearm [or other], weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, ammunition, or firearm accessory or firearm component as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, ordering the search for and seizure of any firearm or other weapon at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe the weapon is located and the seizure of any firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun issued to the defendant and any other appropriate relief. If the order requires the surrender of any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component, a law enforcement officer shall accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if necessary, to the scene of the domestic violence or any other location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component belonging to the defendant is located, to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any firearm 1[or other],1 weapon, 1ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component,1 and that the firearm 1[or other],1 weapon1, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component1 is appropriately surrendered in accordance with the order.  If the order prohibits the defendant from returning to the scene of domestic violence or any other location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component belonging to the defendant is located, any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component located there shall be seized by a law enforcement officer.  The order shall include notice to the defendant of the penalties for a violation of any provision of the order, including but not limited to the penalties for contempt of court and unlawful possession of a firearm or other weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5.  Other appropriate relief may include but is not limited to an order directing the possession of any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household and providing that the animal shall not be disposed of prior to entry of a final order pursuant to section 13 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-29). The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and scope of any search and seizure authorized by the order.  The provisions of this subsection prohibiting a defendant from possessing a firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component shall not apply to any law enforcement officer while actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States or member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to or from an authorized place of duty. k.   The judge may permit the defendant to return to the scene of the domestic violence to pick up personal belongings and effects but shall, in the order granting relief, restrict the time and duration of such permission and provide for police supervision of such visit. l.    An order granting emergency relief, together with the complaint or complaints, shall immediately be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agency for service on the defendant, and to the police of the municipality in which the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and shall immediately be served upon the defendant along with a copy of the translated order, if applicable, by the police, except that an order issued during regular court hours may be forwarded to the sheriff for immediate service upon the defendant in accordance with the Rules of Court.  If personal service cannot be effected upon the defendant, the court may order other appropriate substituted service.  At no time shall the plaintiff be asked or required to serve any order on the defendant. m.  (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1994, c.94.) n. Notice of temporary restraining orders issued pursuant to this section shall be sent by the clerk of the court or other person designated by the court to the appropriate chiefs of police, members of the State Police and any other appropriate law enforcement agency or court. o.   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1994, c.94.) p.   Any temporary or final restraining order issued pursuant to this act shall be in effect throughout the State, and shall be enforced by all law enforcement officers. q.   Prior to the issuance of any temporary or final restraining order issued pursuant to this section, the court shall order that a search be made of the domestic violence central registry with regard to the defendants record. (cf: P.L.2023, c.234, s.2) 6. Section 13 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-29) is amended to read as follows: 13. a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a hearing shall be held in the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court within 10 days of the filing of a complaint pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-28) in the county where the ex parte restraints were ordered, unless good cause is shown for the hearing to be held elsewhere.  A copy of the complaint shall be served on the defendant in conformity with the Rules of Court.  If a criminal complaint arising out of the same incident which is the subject matter of a complaint brought under P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et seq.) or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.) has been filed, testimony given by the plaintiff or defendant in the domestic violence matter shall not be used in the simultaneous or subsequent criminal proceeding against the defendant, other than domestic violence contempt matters and where it would otherwise be admissible hearsay under the rules of evidence that govern where a party is unavailable.  If there are law enforcement records related to an incident which is the subject of a complaint or the domestic violence history described in the complaint, and the plaintiff has requested the records, the court shall grant plaintiffs request for an adjournment if reasonably needed to collect evidence contained in the law enforcement records.  If the plaintiff has requested records from a law enforcement agency pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.322 (C.2C:25-23.1), but has not received the records as of the date of the original or rescheduled hearing, the law enforcement agencys failure to provide the requested records shall be noted on the record prior to the court making a final determination on the request for restraints.  The absence of law enforcement records shall not be a basis to deny relief pursuant to this section.  At the hearing the standard for proving the allegations in the complaint shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. In considering the necessity of ordering a restraining order the court shall consider but not be limited to the following factors: (1) The previous history of domestic violence between the plaintiff and defendant, including threats, harassment and physical abuse; (2) The existence of immediate danger to person or property; (3) The financial circumstances of the plaintiff and defendant; (4) The best interests of the victim and any child; (5) In determining custody and parenting time the protection of the victims safety; (6) The existence of a verifiable order of protection from another jurisdiction; and (7) Any pattern of coercive control against a person that in purpose or effect unreasonably interferes with, threatens, or exploits a persons liberty, freedom, bodily integrity, or human rights with the court specifically considering evidence of the need for protection from immediate danger or the prevention of further abuse.  If the court finds that one or more factors of coercive control are more or less relevant than others, the court shall make specific written findings of fact and conclusions of law on the reasons why the court reached that conclusion.  Coercive control may include, but shall not be limited to: (a) isolating the person from friends, relatives, transportation, medical care, or other source of support; (b) depriving the person of basic necessities; (c) monitoring the persons movements, communications, daily behavior, finances, economic resources, or access to services; (d) compelling the person by force, threat, or intimidation, including, but not limited to, threats based on actual or suspected immigration status; (e) threatening to make or making baseless reports to the police, courts, the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP) within the Department of Children and Families, the Board of Social Services, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), or other parties; (f) threatening to harm or kill the individuals relative or pet; (g) threatening to deny or interfere with an individuals custody or parenting time, other than through enforcement of a valid custody arrangement or court order pursuant to current law including, but not limited to, an order issued pursuant to Title 9 of the Revised Statutes; or (h) any other factors or circumstances that the court deems relevant or material. An order issued under this act shall only restrain or provide damages payable from a person against whom a complaint has been filed under this act and only after a finding or an admission is made that an act of domestic violence was committed by that person.  The issue of whether or not a violation of this act occurred, including an act of contempt under this act, shall not be subject to mediation or negotiation in any form.  In addition, where a temporary or final order has been issued pursuant to this act, no party shall be ordered to participate in mediation on the issue of custody or parenting time. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall prepare standard templates for final restraining orders in English, Spanish and the other high-demand languages identified in its Language Access Plan as approved by the Supreme Court.  These templates shall be available for judges and staff of the Superior Court Family Part to provide to the victim and defendant when issuing final restraining orders pursuant to this section. b.   In proceedings in which complaints for restraining orders have been filed, the court shall grant any relief necessary to prevent further abuse.  In addition to any other provisions, any restraining order issued by the court shall bar the defendant from purchasing, owning, possessing or controlling a firearm or ammunition, or any firearm accessory or firearm component as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and from receiving or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3 during the period in which the restraining order is in effect or two years, whichever is greater.  The order shall require the immediate surrender of any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component belonging to the defendant.  The order shall include notice to the defendant of the penalties for a violation of any provision of the order, including but not limited to the penalties for contempt of court and unlawful possession of a firearm or other weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5. A law enforcement officer shall accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if necessary, to any place where any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component belonging to the defendant is located to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component, and a law enforcement officer shall take custody of any firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant.  If the order prohibits the defendant from returning to the scene of domestic violence or other place where firearms [or other weapons], weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components belonging to the defendant are located, any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component located there shall be seized by a law enforcement officer.  The provisions of this subsection requiring the surrender or removal of a firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component, card, or permit shall not apply to any law enforcement officer while actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States or member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to or from an authorized place of duty.  At the hearing the judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court may issue an order granting any or all of the following relief: (1) An order restraining the defendant from subjecting the victim to domestic violence, as defined in this act. (2) (a) An order granting exclusive possession to the plaintiff of the residence or household regardless of whether the residence or household is jointly or solely owned by the parties or jointly or solely leased by the parties.  This order shall not in any manner affect title or interest to any real property held by either party or both jointly.  If it is not possible for the victim to remain in the residence, the court may order the defendant to pay the victims rent at a residence other than the one previously shared by the parties if the defendant is found to have a duty to support the victim and the victim requires alternative housing. (b) An order that the landlord of a residential dwelling unit shall change the locks on the dwelling unit in which the victim resides pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2023, c.174 (C.46:8-9.14). (3) An order providing for parenting time.  The order shall protect the safety and well-being of the plaintiff and minor children and shall specify the place and frequency of parenting time.  Parenting time arrangements shall not compromise any other remedy provided by the court by requiring or encouraging contact between the plaintiff and defendant.  Orders for parenting time may include a designation of a place of parenting time away from the plaintiff, the participation of a third party, or supervised parenting time. (a) The court shall consider a request by a custodial parent who has been subjected to domestic violence by a person with parenting time rights to a child in the parents custody for an investigation or evaluation by the appropriate agency to assess the risk of harm to the child prior to the entry of a parenting time order.  Any denial of such a request must be on the record and shall only be made if the judge finds the request to be arbitrary or capricious. (b) The court shall consider suspension of the parenting time order and hold an emergency hearing upon an application made by the plaintiff certifying under oath that the defendants access to the child pursuant to the parenting time order has threatened the safety and well-being of the child. (4) An order requiring the defendant to pay to the victim monetary compensation for losses suffered as a direct result of the act of domestic violence.  The order may require the defendant to pay the victim directly, to reimburse the Victims of Crime Compensation Office for any and all compensation paid by the Victims of Crime Compensation Office directly to or on behalf of the victim, and may require that the defendant reimburse any parties that may have compensated the victim, as the court may determine.  Compensatory losses shall include, but not be limited to, loss of earnings or other support, including child or spousal support, out-of-pocket losses for injuries sustained, cost of repair or replacement of real or personal property damaged or destroyed or taken by the defendant, cost of replacing locks pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2023, c.174 (C.46:8-9.14), cost of counseling for the victim, moving or other travel expenses, reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, and compensation for pain and suffering.  Where appropriate, punitive damages may be awarded in addition to compensatory damages. (5) An order requiring the defendant to receive professional domestic violence counseling from either a private source or a source appointed by the court and, in that event, requiring the defendant to provide the court at specified intervals with documentation of attendance at the professional counseling.  The court may order the defendant to pay for the professional counseling.  No application by the defendant to dissolve a final order which contains a requirement for attendance at professional counseling pursuant to this paragraph shall be granted by the court unless, in addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions ordered by the court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at such counseling. (6) An order restraining the defendant from entering the residence, property, school, or place of employment of the victim or of other family or household members of the victim and requiring the defendant to stay away from any specified place that is named in the order and is frequented regularly by the victim or other family or household members. (7) An order restraining the defendant from making contact with the plaintiff or others, including an order forbidding the defendant from personally or through an agent initiating any communication likely to cause annoyance or alarm including, but not limited to, personal, written, or telephone contact with the victim or other family members, or their employers, employees, or fellow workers, or others with whom communication would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm to the victim. (8) An order requiring that the defendant make or continue to make rent or mortgage payments on the residence occupied by the victim if the defendant is found to have a duty to support the victim or other dependent household members; provided that this issue has not been resolved or is not being litigated between the parties in another action. (9) An order granting either party temporary possession of specified personal property, such as an automobile, checkbook, documentation of health insurance, an identification document, a key, and other personal effects. (10) An order awarding emergency monetary relief, including emergency support for minor children, to the victim and other dependents, if any.  An ongoing obligation of support shall be determined at a later date pursuant to applicable law. (11) An order awarding temporary custody of a minor child.  The court shall presume that the best interests of the child are served by an award of custody to the non-abusive parent. (12) An order requiring that a law enforcement officer accompany either party to the residence or any shared business premises to supervise the removal of personal belongings in order to ensure the personal safety of the plaintiff when a restraining order has been issued.  This order shall be restricted in duration. (13) (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1995, c.242). (14) An order granting any other appropriate relief for the plaintiff and dependent children, provided that the plaintiff consents to such relief, including relief requested by the plaintiff at the final hearing, whether or not the plaintiff requested such relief at the time of the granting of the initial emergency order. (15) An order that requires that the defendant report to the intake unit of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court for monitoring of any other provision of the order. (16) In addition to the order required by this subsection prohibiting the defendant from possessing any firearm, the court may also issue an order prohibiting the defendant from possessing any other weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, ammunition, or any firearm accessory or firearm component as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and ordering the search for and seizure of any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe the firearm, weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component is located.  The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and scope of the search and seizure authorized by the order. (17) An order prohibiting the defendant from stalking or following, or threatening to harm, to stalk or to follow, the complainant or any other person named in the order in a manner that, taken in the context of past actions of the defendant, would put the complainant in reasonable fear that the defendant would cause the death or injury of the complainant or any other person.  Behavior prohibited under this act includes, but is not limited to, behavior prohibited under the provisions of P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10).

(1) As used in this section, the word exhibits is to be liberally construed to mean any indication that a victim has suffered bodily injury, which shall include physical pain or any impairment of physical condition.  Where the victim exhibits no visible sign of injury, but states that an injury has occurred, the officer should consider other relevant factors in determining whether there is probable cause to make an arrest. (2) In determining which party in a domestic violence incident is the victim where both parties exhibit signs of injury, the officer should consider the comparative extent of the injuries, the history of domestic violence between the parties, if any, and any other relevant factors. (3) No victim shall be denied relief or arrested or charged under this act with an offense because the victim used reasonable force in self defense against domestic violence by an attacker. d. (1) In addition to a law enforcement officers authority to seize any weapon that is contraband, evidence or an instrumentality of crime, a law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe that an act of domestic violence has been committed shall: (a) question persons present to determine whether there are weapons on the premises; and (b) upon observing or learning that a weapon is present on the premises, seize any weapon that the officer reasonably believes would expose the victim to a risk of serious bodily injury.  If a law enforcement officer seizes any firearm pursuant to this paragraph, the officer shall also seize any ammunition, or firearm accessory, or firearm component as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, and any firearm purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun issued to the person accused of the act of domestic violence. (2) A law enforcement officer shall deliver all weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, firearm components, firearms purchaser identification cards and permits to purchase a handgun seized pursuant to this section to the county prosecutor and shall append an inventory of all seized items to the domestic violence report. (3) Weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components seized in accordance with the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991, P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.) shall be returned to the owner except upon order of the Superior Court.  The prosecutor who has possession of the seized weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components may, upon notice to the owner, petition a judge of the Family Part of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, within 45 days of seizure, to obtain title to the seized weapons, or to revoke any and all permits, licenses and other authorizations for the use, possession, or ownership of such weapons pursuant to the law governing such use, possession, or ownership, or may object to the return of the weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components on such grounds as are provided for the initial rejection or later revocation of the authorizations, or on the grounds that the owner is unfit or that the owner poses a threat to the public in general or a person or persons in particular. A hearing shall be held and a record made thereof within 45 days of the notice provided above.  No formal pleading and no filing fee shall be required as a preliminary to such hearing.  The hearing shall be summary in nature.  Appeals from the results of the hearing shall be to the Superior Court, Appellate Division, in accordance with the law. If the prosecutor does not institute an action within 45 days of seizure, the seized weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components shall be returned to the owner. After the hearing the court shall order the return of the firearms, weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, firearm components, and any authorization papers relating to the seized weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, and firearm components to the owner if the court determines the owner is not subject to any of the disabilities set forth in subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:58-3 and finds that the complaint has been dismissed at the request of the complainant and the prosecutor determines that there is insufficient probable cause to indict; or if the defendant is found not guilty of the charges; or if the court determines that the domestic violence situation no longer exists.  At least 10 days prior to returning the seized weapons, the prosecutor shall notify each claimant or victim that the weapons will be returned to the owner. Nothing in this act shall impair the right of the State to retain evidence pending a criminal prosecution.  Nor shall any provision of this act be construed to limit the authority of the State or a law enforcement officer to seize, retain or forfeit property pursuant to chapter 64 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes. If, after the hearing, the court determines that the weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components are not to be returned to the owner, the court may: (a) With respect to weapons other than firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components, order the prosecutor to dispose of the weapons if the owner does not arrange for the transfer or sale of the weapons to an appropriate person within 60 days; or (b) Order the revocation of the owners firearms purchaser identification card or any permit, license or authorization, in which case the court shall order the owner to surrender any firearm, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components seized and all other firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components possessed to the prosecutor and shall order the prosecutor to dispose of the firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components if the owner does not arrange for the sale of the firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components to a registered dealer of the firearms within 60 days; or (c) Order such other relief as it may deem appropriate.  When the court orders the weapons, firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components forfeited to the State or the prosecutor is required to dispose of the weapons, the prosecutor shall dispose of the property as provided in N.J.S.2C:64-6. (4) A civil suit may be brought to enjoin a wrongful failure to return a seized firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component where the prosecutor refuses to return the [weapon] firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component after receiving a written request to do so and notice of the owners intent to bring a civil action pursuant to this section.  Failure of the prosecutor to comply with the provisions of this act shall entitle the prevailing party in the civil suit to reasonable costs, including attorneys fees, provided that the court finds that the prosecutor failed to act in good faith in retaining the seized weapon. (5) No law enforcement officer or agency shall be held liable in any civil action brought by any person for failing to learn of, locate or seize a weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component pursuant to this act, or for returning a seized weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component to its owner. (cf: P.L.2021, c.358, s.1) 3. Section 10 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-26) is amended to read as follows: 10. a.  When a defendant charged with a crime or offense involving domestic violence is released from custody before trial on bail or personal recognizance, the court authorizing the release may as a condition of release issue an order prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with the victim including, but not limited to, restraining the defendant from entering the victims residence, place of employment or business, or school, and from harassing or stalking the victim or the victims friends, co-workers, or relatives in any way.  If the victim is pregnant, at the victims request the court may order that the victims child shall, immediately upon birth, be included in the order.  The court may also enter an order prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household.  In addition, the court may enter an order directing the possession of the animal and providing that the animal shall not be disposed of prior to the disposition of the crime or offense.  The court may enter an order prohibiting the defendant from possessing any firearm, ammunition, or firearm accessory or firearm component as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:29-1, or [other] weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and ordering the search for and seizure of any such weapon at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe the weapon is located.  The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and scope of the search and seizure authorized by the order. b.   The written court order releasing the defendant shall contain the courts directives specifically restricting the defendants ability to have contact with the victim, the victims friends, co-workers, or relatives, or any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household.  The prosecutor shall provide a copy of this order to the victim forthwith. c.   The victims location shall remain confidential and shall not appear on any documents or records to which the defendant has access. d.   Before bail is set, the defendants prior record shall be considered by the court. The court shall also conduct a search of the domestic violence central registry.  Bail shall be set as soon as is feasible, but in all cases within 24 hours of arrest. e.   Once bail is set it shall not be reduced without prior notice to the county prosecutor and the victim.  Bail shall not be reduced by a judge other than the judge who originally ordered bail, unless the reasons for the amount of the original bail are available to the judge who reduces the bail and are set forth in the record. f.    A victim shall not be prohibited from applying for, and a court shall not be prohibited from issuing, temporary restraints pursuant to this act because the victim has charged any person with commission of a criminal act. (cf: P.L.2023, c.239, s.1) 4. Section 11 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-27) is amended to read as follows: 11. a.  When a defendant is found guilty of a crime or offense involving domestic violence and a condition of sentence restricts the defendants ability to have contact with the victim, the victims friends, co-workers, or relatives, or an animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household, that condition shall be recorded in an order of the court and a written copy of that order shall be provided to the victim by the clerk of the court or other person designated by the court.  If the victim is pregnant, at the victims request the court may order that the victims child shall, immediately upon birth, be included in the order.  In addition to restricting a defendants ability to have contact with the victim, the victims friends, co-workers, or relatives, or an animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household, the court may require the defendant to receive professional counseling from either a private source or a source appointed by the court, and if the court so orders, the court shall require the defendant to provide documentation of attendance at the professional counseling.  In any case where the court order contains a requirement that the defendant receive professional counseling, no application by the defendant to dissolve the restraining order shall be granted unless, in addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions ordered by the court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at such counseling. b.   In addition the court may enter an order directing the possession of an animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household.  Where a person has abused or threatened to abuse such animal, there shall be a presumption that possession of the animal shall be awarded to the non-abusive party. c. (1)  When a defendant is found guilty of a crime or offense involving domestic violence, the court shall inform the defendant that the defendant is prohibited from purchasing, owning, possessing, or controlling a firearm or ammunition pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1979, c.179 (C.2C:39-7), or firearm accessories or firearm components as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and from receiving or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3.  The court shall order the defendant to arrange for the immediate surrender to a law enforcement officer of any firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component that has not already been seized or surrendered and any firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun possessed by the defendant.  No later than five business days after the order is entered, however, the defendant may arrange to sell any surrendered firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component to a licensed retail dealer of firearms who shall be authorized to take possession of that purchased firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component from the law enforcement agency to which it was surrendered no later than 10 business days after the order is entered.  Any card or permit issued to the defendant shall be deemed immediately revoked.  The court shall establish a process for notifying the appropriate authorities of the conviction requiring the revocation of the card or permit.  A law enforcement officer accepting a surrendered firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component shall provide the defendant with a receipt listing the date of surrender, the name of the defendant, and any item that has been surrendered, including, as appropriate, the serial number, manufacturer, and model of the surrendered firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component.  The defendant shall provide a copy of this receipt to the prosecutor within 48 hours of service of the order, and shall attest under penalty that any firearms, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components owned or possessed at the time of the order have been transferred in accordance with this section and that the defendant currently does not possess any [firearms] of these items.  The defendant alternatively may attest under penalty that he did not own or possess a firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component at the time of the order and currently does not possess a firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component.  If the court, upon motion of the prosecutor, finds probable cause that the defendant has failed to surrender any firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, firearm component, card, or permit, the court may order a search for and removal of these items at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe these items are located.  The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and the scope of the search and seizure authorized by the order. (2) A law enforcement officer who receives a firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component that is surrendered, but not purchased and taken possession of by a licensed retail dealer of firearms within 10 business days of when the order is entered pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, may dispose of the surrendered firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.2C:64-6.  A firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component purchased by a licensed retail dealer from a defendant shall become part of the inventory of the dealer. (cf: P.L.2023, c.239, s.2) 5. Section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-28) is amended to read as follows: 12. a.  A victim may file a complaint alleging the commission of an act of domestic violence with the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court in conformity with the Rules of Court.  The court shall not dismiss any complaint or delay disposition of a case because the victim has left the residence to avoid further incidents of domestic violence.  Filing a complaint pursuant to this section shall not prevent the filing of a criminal complaint for the same act. On weekends, holidays and other times when the court is closed, a victim may file a complaint before a judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court or a municipal court judge who shall be assigned to accept complaints and issue emergency, ex parte relief in the form of temporary restraining orders pursuant to this act. A plaintiff may apply for relief under this section in a court having jurisdiction over the place where the alleged act of domestic violence occurred, where the defendant resides, or where the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and the court shall follow the same procedures applicable to other emergency applications.  Criminal complaints filed pursuant to this act shall be investigated and prosecuted in the jurisdiction where the offense is alleged to have occurred.  Contempt complaints filed pursuant to N.J.S.2C:29-9 shall be prosecuted in the county where the contempt is alleged to have been committed and a copy of the contempt complaint shall be forwarded to the court that issued the order alleged to have been violated. b.   The court shall waive any requirement that the petitioners place of residence appear on the complaint. c. (1)  The clerk of the court, or other person designated by the court, shall assist the parties in completing any forms necessary for the filing of a summons, complaint, answer or other pleading.

(3) Information provided by the plaintiff concerning firearms, ammunition, or firearm accessories or firearm components as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, to which the defendant has access shall be kept confidential and shall not be disseminated or disclosed, provided that nothing in this subsection shall prohibit dissemination or disclosure of this information in a manner consistent with and in furtherance of the purpose for which the information was provided. d.   Summons and complaint forms shall be readily available at the clerks office, at the municipal courts and at municipal and State police stations. e.   As soon as the domestic violence complaint is filed, both the victim and the abuser shall be advised of any programs or services available for advice and counseling. f.    A plaintiff may seek emergency, ex parte relief in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A municipal court judge or a judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court may enter an ex parte order when necessary to protect the life, health or well-being of a victim on whose behalf the relief is sought. g.   If it appears that the plaintiff is in danger of domestic violence, the judge shall, upon consideration of the plaintiffs domestic violence complaint, order emergency ex parte relief, in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A decision shall be made by the judge regarding the emergency relief forthwith. h. (1)  A judge may issue a temporary restraining order upon sworn testimony or complaint of an applicant who is not physically present, pursuant to court rules, or by a person who represents a person who is physically or mentally incapable of filing personally.  A temporary restraining order may be issued if the judge is satisfied that exigent circumstances exist sufficient to excuse the failure of the applicant to appear personally and that sufficient grounds for granting the application have been shown. (2) The Administrative Office of the Court shall prepare standard templates for temporary restraining orders in English, Spanish, and the other high-demand languages identified in its Language Access Plan as approved by the Supreme Court.  These templates shall be available for law enforcement, judges of the Municipal Court, and judges and staff of the Superior Court to provide to the victim and defendant when issuing temporary restraining orders pursuant to this section. i.    An order for emergency, ex parte relief shall be granted upon good cause shown and shall remain in effect until a judge of the Family Part issues a further order.  Any temporary order hereunder is immediately appealable for a plenary hearing de novo not on the record before any judge of the Family Part of the county in which the plaintiff resides or is sheltered if that judge issued the temporary order or has access to the reasons for the issuance of the temporary order and sets forth in the record the reasons for the modification or dissolution.  The denial of a temporary restraining order by a municipal court judge and subsequent administrative dismissal of the complaint shall not bar the victim from refiling a complaint in the Family Part based on the same incident and receiving an emergency, ex parte hearing de novo not on the record before a Family Part judge, and every denial of relief by a municipal court judge shall so state. j.    Emergency relief may include forbidding the defendant from returning to the scene of the domestic violence, forbidding the defendant from possessing any firearm [or other], weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, ammunition, or firearm accessory or firearm component as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, ordering the search for and seizure of any firearm or other weapon at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe the weapon is located and the seizure of any firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun issued to the defendant and any other appropriate relief. If the order requires the surrender of any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component, a law enforcement officer shall accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if necessary, to the scene of the domestic violence or any other location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component belonging to the defendant is located, to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any firearm 1[or other],1 weapon, 1ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component,1 and that the firearm 1[or other],1 weapon1, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component1 is appropriately surrendered in accordance with the order.  If the order prohibits the defendant from returning to the scene of domestic violence or any other location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component belonging to the defendant is located, any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component located there shall be seized by a law enforcement officer.  The order shall include notice to the defendant of the penalties for a violation of any provision of the order, including but not limited to the penalties for contempt of court and unlawful possession of a firearm or other weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5.  Other appropriate relief may include but is not limited to an order directing the possession of any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household and providing that the animal shall not be disposed of prior to entry of a final order pursuant to section 13 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-29). The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and scope of any search and seizure authorized by the order.  The provisions of this subsection prohibiting a defendant from possessing a firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component shall not apply to any law enforcement officer while actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States or member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to or from an authorized place of duty. k.   The judge may permit the defendant to return to the scene of the domestic violence to pick up personal belongings and effects but shall, in the order granting relief, restrict the time and duration of such permission and provide for police supervision of such visit. l.    An order granting emergency relief, together with the complaint or complaints, shall immediately be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agency for service on the defendant, and to the police of the municipality in which the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and shall immediately be served upon the defendant along with a copy of the translated order, if applicable, by the police, except that an order issued during regular court hours may be forwarded to the sheriff for immediate service upon the defendant in accordance with the Rules of Court.  If personal service cannot be effected upon the defendant, the court may order other appropriate substituted service.  At no time shall the plaintiff be asked or required to serve any order on the defendant. m.  (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1994, c.94.) n. Notice of temporary restraining orders issued pursuant to this section shall be sent by the clerk of the court or other person designated by the court to the appropriate chiefs of police, members of the State Police and any other appropriate law enforcement agency or court. o.   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1994, c.94.) p.   Any temporary or final restraining order issued pursuant to this act shall be in effect throughout the State, and shall be enforced by all law enforcement officers. q.   Prior to the issuance of any temporary or final restraining order issued pursuant to this section, the court shall order that a search be made of the domestic violence central registry with regard to the defendants record. (cf: P.L.2023, c.234, s.2) 6. Section 13 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-29) is amended to read as follows: 13. a. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a hearing shall be held in the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court within 10 days of the filing of a complaint pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-28) in the county where the ex parte restraints were ordered, unless good cause is shown for the hearing to be held elsewhere.  A copy of the complaint shall be served on the defendant in conformity with the Rules of Court.  If a criminal complaint arising out of the same incident which is the subject matter of a complaint brought under P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et seq.) or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.) has been filed, testimony given by the plaintiff or defendant in the domestic violence matter shall not be used in the simultaneous or subsequent criminal proceeding against the defendant, other than domestic violence contempt matters and where it would otherwise be admissible hearsay under the rules of evidence that govern where a party is unavailable.  If there are law enforcement records related to an incident which is the subject of a complaint or the domestic violence history described in the complaint, and the plaintiff has requested the records, the court shall grant plaintiffs request for an adjournment if reasonably needed to collect evidence contained in the law enforcement records.  If the plaintiff has requested records from a law enforcement agency pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.322 (C.2C:25-23.1), but has not received the records as of the date of the original or rescheduled hearing, the law enforcement agencys failure to provide the requested records shall be noted on the record prior to the court making a final determination on the request for restraints.  The absence of law enforcement records shall not be a basis to deny relief pursuant to this section.  At the hearing the standard for proving the allegations in the complaint shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. In considering the necessity of ordering a restraining order the court shall consider but not be limited to the following factors: (1) The previous history of domestic violence between the plaintiff and defendant, including threats, harassment and physical abuse; (2) The existence of immediate danger to person or property; (3) The financial circumstances of the plaintiff and defendant; (4) The best interests of the victim and any child; (5) In determining custody and parenting time the protection of the victims safety; (6) The existence of a verifiable order of protection from another jurisdiction; and (7) Any pattern of coercive control against a person that in purpose or effect unreasonably interferes with, threatens, or exploits a persons liberty, freedom, bodily integrity, or human rights with the court specifically considering evidence of the need for protection from immediate danger or the prevention of further abuse.  If the court finds that one or more factors of coercive control are more or less relevant than others, the court shall make specific written findings of fact and conclusions of law on the reasons why the court reached that conclusion.  Coercive control may include, but shall not be limited to: (a) isolating the person from friends, relatives, transportation, medical care, or other source of support; (b) depriving the person of basic necessities; (c) monitoring the persons movements, communications, daily behavior, finances, economic resources, or access to services; (d) compelling the person by force, threat, or intimidation, including, but not limited to, threats based on actual or suspected immigration status; (e) threatening to make or making baseless reports to the police, courts, the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP) within the Department of Children and Families, the Board of Social Services, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), or other parties; (f) threatening to harm or kill the individuals relative or pet; (g) threatening to deny or interfere with an individuals custody or parenting time, other than through enforcement of a valid custody arrangement or court order pursuant to current law including, but not limited to, an order issued pursuant to Title 9 of the Revised Statutes; or (h) any other factors or circumstances that the court deems relevant or material. An order issued under this act shall only restrain or provide damages payable from a person against whom a complaint has been filed under this act and only after a finding or an admission is made that an act of domestic violence was committed by that person.  The issue of whether or not a violation of this act occurred, including an act of contempt under this act, shall not be subject to mediation or negotiation in any form.  In addition, where a temporary or final order has been issued pursuant to this act, no party shall be ordered to participate in mediation on the issue of custody or parenting time. The Administrative Office of the Courts shall prepare standard templates for final restraining orders in English, Spanish and the other high-demand languages identified in its Language Access Plan as approved by the Supreme Court.  These templates shall be available for judges and staff of the Superior Court Family Part to provide to the victim and defendant when issuing final restraining orders pursuant to this section. b.   In proceedings in which complaints for restraining orders have been filed, the court shall grant any relief necessary to prevent further abuse.  In addition to any other provisions, any restraining order issued by the court shall bar the defendant from purchasing, owning, possessing or controlling a firearm or ammunition, or any firearm accessory or firearm component as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and from receiving or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3 during the period in which the restraining order is in effect or two years, whichever is greater.  The order shall require the immediate surrender of any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component belonging to the defendant.  The order shall include notice to the defendant of the penalties for a violation of any provision of the order, including but not limited to the penalties for contempt of court and unlawful possession of a firearm or other weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5. A law enforcement officer shall accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if necessary, to any place where any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component belonging to the defendant is located to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component, and a law enforcement officer shall take custody of any firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant.  If the order prohibits the defendant from returning to the scene of domestic violence or other place where firearms [or other weapons], weapons, ammunition, firearm accessories, or firearm components belonging to the defendant are located, any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component located there shall be seized by a law enforcement officer.  The provisions of this subsection requiring the surrender or removal of a firearm, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component, card, or permit shall not apply to any law enforcement officer while actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States or member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to or from an authorized place of duty.  At the hearing the judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court may issue an order granting any or all of the following relief: (1) An order restraining the defendant from subjecting the victim to domestic violence, as defined in this act. (2) (a) An order granting exclusive possession to the plaintiff of the residence or household regardless of whether the residence or household is jointly or solely owned by the parties or jointly or solely leased by the parties.  This order shall not in any manner affect title or interest to any real property held by either party or both jointly.  If it is not possible for the victim to remain in the residence, the court may order the defendant to pay the victims rent at a residence other than the one previously shared by the parties if the defendant is found to have a duty to support the victim and the victim requires alternative housing. (b) An order that the landlord of a residential dwelling unit shall change the locks on the dwelling unit in which the victim resides pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2023, c.174 (C.46:8-9.14). (3) An order providing for parenting time.  The order shall protect the safety and well-being of the plaintiff and minor children and shall specify the place and frequency of parenting time.  Parenting time arrangements shall not compromise any other remedy provided by the court by requiring or encouraging contact between the plaintiff and defendant.  Orders for parenting time may include a designation of a place of parenting time away from the plaintiff, the participation of a third party, or supervised parenting time. (a) The court shall consider a request by a custodial parent who has been subjected to domestic violence by a person with parenting time rights to a child in the parents custody for an investigation or evaluation by the appropriate agency to assess the risk of harm to the child prior to the entry of a parenting time order.  Any denial of such a request must be on the record and shall only be made if the judge finds the request to be arbitrary or capricious. (b) The court shall consider suspension of the parenting time order and hold an emergency hearing upon an application made by the plaintiff certifying under oath that the defendants access to the child pursuant to the parenting time order has threatened the safety and well-being of the child. (4) An order requiring the defendant to pay to the victim monetary compensation for losses suffered as a direct result of the act of domestic violence.  The order may require the defendant to pay the victim directly, to reimburse the Victims of Crime Compensation Office for any and all compensation paid by the Victims of Crime Compensation Office directly to or on behalf of the victim, and may require that the defendant reimburse any parties that may have compensated the victim, as the court may determine.  Compensatory losses shall include, but not be limited to, loss of earnings or other support, including child or spousal support, out-of-pocket losses for injuries sustained, cost of repair or replacement of real or personal property damaged or destroyed or taken by the defendant, cost of replacing locks pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2023, c.174 (C.46:8-9.14), cost of counseling for the victim, moving or other travel expenses, reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, and compensation for pain and suffering.  Where appropriate, punitive damages may be awarded in addition to compensatory damages. (5) An order requiring the defendant to receive professional domestic violence counseling from either a private source or a source appointed by the court and, in that event, requiring the defendant to provide the court at specified intervals with documentation of attendance at the professional counseling.  The court may order the defendant to pay for the professional counseling.  No application by the defendant to dissolve a final order which contains a requirement for attendance at professional counseling pursuant to this paragraph shall be granted by the court unless, in addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions ordered by the court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at such counseling. (6) An order restraining the defendant from entering the residence, property, school, or place of employment of the victim or of other family or household members of the victim and requiring the defendant to stay away from any specified place that is named in the order and is frequented regularly by the victim or other family or household members. (7) An order restraining the defendant from making contact with the plaintiff or others, including an order forbidding the defendant from personally or through an agent initiating any communication likely to cause annoyance or alarm including, but not limited to, personal, written, or telephone contact with the victim or other family members, or their employers, employees, or fellow workers, or others with whom communication would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm to the victim. (8) An order requiring that the defendant make or continue to make rent or mortgage payments on the residence occupied by the victim if the defendant is found to have a duty to support the victim or other dependent household members; provided that this issue has not been resolved or is not being litigated between the parties in another action. (9) An order granting either party temporary possession of specified personal property, such as an automobile, checkbook, documentation of health insurance, an identification document, a key, and other personal effects. (10) An order awarding emergency monetary relief, including emergency support for minor children, to the victim and other dependents, if any.  An ongoing obligation of support shall be determined at a later date pursuant to applicable law. (11) An order awarding temporary custody of a minor child.  The court shall presume that the best interests of the child are served by an award of custody to the non-abusive parent. (12) An order requiring that a law enforcement officer accompany either party to the residence or any shared business premises to supervise the removal of personal belongings in order to ensure the personal safety of the plaintiff when a restraining order has been issued.  This order shall be restricted in duration. (13) (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1995, c.242). (14) An order granting any other appropriate relief for the plaintiff and dependent children, provided that the plaintiff consents to such relief, including relief requested by the plaintiff at the final hearing, whether or not the plaintiff requested such relief at the time of the granting of the initial emergency order. (15) An order that requires that the defendant report to the intake unit of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court for monitoring of any other provision of the order. (16) In addition to the order required by this subsection prohibiting the defendant from possessing any firearm, the court may also issue an order prohibiting the defendant from possessing any other weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, ammunition, or any firearm accessory or firearm component as defined in subsections oo. and pp. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and ordering the search for and seizure of any firearm [or other], weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe the firearm, weapon, ammunition, firearm accessory, or firearm component is located.  The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and scope of the search and seizure authorized by the order. (17) An order prohibiting the defendant from stalking or following, or threatening to harm, to stalk or to follow, the complainant or any other person named in the order in a manner that, taken in the context of past actions of the defendant, would put the complainant in reasonable fear that the defendant would cause the death or injury of the complainant or any other person.  Behavior prohibited under this act includes, but is not limited to, behavior prohibited under the provisions of P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10). (18) An order requiring the defendant to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. (19) An order directing the possession of any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household.  Where a person has abused or threatened to abuse such animal, there shall be a presumption that possession of the animal shall be awarded to the non-abusive party. (20) At the plaintiffs request, an order providing that, if the plaintiff is pregnant, the plaintiffs child shall be included in the restraining order immediately upon birth. c.   Notice of orders issued pursuant to this section shall be sent by the clerk of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court or other person designated by the court to the appropriate chiefs of police, members of the State Police and any other appropriate law enforcement agency. d.   Upon good cause shown, any final order may be dissolved or modified upon application to the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court, but only if the judge who dissolves or modifies the order is the same judge who entered the order, or has available a complete record of the hearing or hearings on which the order was based. e.   Prior to the issuance of any order pursuant to this section, the court shall order that a search be made of the domestic violence central registry. f.    A final judgment rendered in favor of the State in any criminal proceeding brought pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991, P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.) shall estop the defendant from denying the same conduct in any proceeding brought pursuant to this section. g.   In connection with a pending complaint filed with the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part, pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991, P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.), a party to the complaint may request the release or unsealing of expunged records, or sealed records under prior law, or prior arrests or convictions related to previous complaints filed pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991, P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.) involving both parties. h.   Expunged records, or sealed records under prior law, of prior arrests or convictions shall be provided to any party, county prosecutor, Criminal Division of the Superior Court, or the Attorney General when requested for use in conjunction with proceedings related to any of the following matters: (1) a temporary or final restraining order or a weapons forfeiture complaint filed in the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part, pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991, P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.); and (2) a temporary or final extreme risk protection order complaint filed in the Superior Court pursuant to the Extreme Risk Protective Order Act of 2018, P.L.2018, c.35 (C.2C:58-20 et al.).
