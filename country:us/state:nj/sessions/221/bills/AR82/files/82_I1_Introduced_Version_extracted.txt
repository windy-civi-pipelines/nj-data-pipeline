The New Jersey General Assembly respectfully urges the New Jersey Department of Health to take the appropriate steps to inform the public of the dangers to humans who use xylazine as a recreational drug. 2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health. STATEMENT This resolution urges the New Jersey Department of Health to take the appropriate steps to inform the public of the dangers to humans who use xylazine as a recreational drug.  The New Jersey Department of Health should increase efforts to raise awareness on the human use of xylazine by providing New Jerseyans with appropriate educational resources. A new street drug, xylazine, also known as Tranq and Zombie Drug has created a growing concern in the State.  The drug is a central nervous system depressant that can cause drowsiness and amnesia as well as slow breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure to dangerously low levels.  Xylazine, a non-opioid veterinary tranquilizer not approved for human use, has been linked to an increasing number of overdose deaths in humans in New Jersey and surrounding states. Xylazine or xylazine-containing drugs are used by injecting, snorting, swallowing, or inhaling.  Repeated xylazine use is also associated with skin ulcers, abscesses, and complications.  People that are exposed to xylazine, knowingly or unknowingly, use it in combination with other drugs, particularly illicit fentanyl.  Xylazine containing fentanyl is used to lengthen the veterinary tranquilizers euphoric effects.  Overdose deaths linked to both xylazine and fentanyl also involved other substances, including cocaine, heroin, benzodiazepines, alcohol, gabapentin, methadone, and prescription opioids.  Since xylazine is not an opioid, naloxone, a medication used for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, cannot be used as an antidote.
