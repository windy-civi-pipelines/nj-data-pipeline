INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This proposed amendment would exempt the value of certain home improvements from property taxes for a limited time.  The Legislature would be required to enact a law granting the exemption. A homeowner could only claim the exemption for a property that is their principal residence.  The amount of the exemption would equal the assessed value of improvements to the property, not to exceed $100,000.  A taxpayer could claim the exemption for no more than three consecutive tax years. The temporary exemption would mean that a homeowner is not required to pay property taxes based on the assessed value of certain home improvements.  During that period, the homeowner would still be required to pay property taxes based on the assessed value of the property before the home improvements were made.  A homeowner would also be required to pay property taxes on the assessed value of any home improvements over $100,000. STATEMENT If approved by the voters of the State, this proposed amendment to the New Jersey Constitution would require the Legislature to enact a homestead improvement property tax exemption statute. The statute would entitle homeowners to a temporary property tax exemption based on the increase in the assessed value of a homeowners principal residence resulting from taxable improvements made to the property.  The total amount of the exemption could not exceed $100,000 of the assessed value of the improvements.  The duration of the exemption would be for no more than three consecutive tax years.
