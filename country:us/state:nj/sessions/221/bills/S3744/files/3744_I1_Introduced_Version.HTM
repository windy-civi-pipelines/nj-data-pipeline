Failure to meet the requirements of the request for proposals may result in the county college disqualifying the vendor from further consideration. The provisions of a proposal shall not be subject to negotiation by the county college. c.     If the county college, at the time of solicitation, utilizes its own employees to provide the goods or perform the services, or both, that are being considered for competitive contracting, the county college shall, at any time prior to, but no later than the time of solicitation for competitive contracting proposals, notify affected employees of the county colleges intention to solicit competitive contracting proposals. Employees or their representatives shall be permitted to submit recommendations and proposals affecting wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment in a manner that meets the goals of the competitive contract.

The county college shall have the right to reject all proposals. e.  The report prepared pursuant to subsection d. of this section shall become part of the public record and shall reflect the final action of the county college. f.  Award of a contract by a county college utilizing competitive contracting shall be made, by resolution of the board of trustees, within 60 days of the receipt of the proposals, except that the proposals of any vendors who consent thereto, may, at the request of the county college, be held for consideration for a longer period as may be agreed. g.    All contracts awarded through competitive contracting pursuant to the provisions of sections 6 through 10 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) for the provision of goods or performance of services shall be in writing. The board of trustees may, subject to the requirements of law, prescribe the forms and manner that contracts shall be made and executed, and the form and manner of the execution and approval of all guarantee, indemnity, fidelity, and other bonds. h.    The county college shall publish a notice in the legal newspaper of the county college summarizing the award of a contract, which shall include but not be limited to: (1) the nature, duration, and amount of the contract; (2) the name of the vendor; and (3) a statement that the resolution and contract are on file and available for public inspection in the office of the county college. 11.  The Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs, after consultation with the Secretary of Higher Education, may adopt rules and regulations, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of sections 6 through 10 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 12.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following the date of enactment.

The provisions of a proposal shall not be subject to negotiation by the county college. c.     If the county college, at the time of solicitation, utilizes its own employees to provide the goods or perform the services, or both, that are being considered for competitive contracting, the county college shall, at any time prior to, but no later than the time of solicitation for competitive contracting proposals, notify affected employees of the county colleges intention to solicit competitive contracting proposals. Employees or their representatives shall be permitted to submit recommendations and proposals affecting wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment in a manner that meets the goals of the competitive contract.
