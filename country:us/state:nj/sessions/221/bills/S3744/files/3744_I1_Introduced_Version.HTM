<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.    (New section) The
competitive contracting process shall utilize a request for proposals
documentation in accordance with the following provisions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  The contracting agent or
counsel shall prepare, or have prepared, a request for proposals documentation,
which shall include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  all requirements deemed
appropriate and necessary to allow for full and free competition between
vendors;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  information necessary for
potential vendors to submit a proposal; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  a methodology for the
evaluation and ranking of proposals received from vendors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The methodology for the
awarding of competitive contracts shall be based on an evaluation and ranking,
which shall include technical, management, and cost related criteria, and may
include a weighting of criteria, all developed for the purpose of meeting the
specific needs of the county college. The criteria shall not unfairly or
illegally discriminate against or exclude otherwise capable vendors. When an
evaluation methodology uses a weighting of criteria, the county college may
disclose to vendors the weight to be accorded to each criterion, prior to
receipt of the proposals.  The methodology for awarding competitive contracts
shall comply with any rules and regulations promulgated by the Director of the
Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs
pursuant to section 11 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  A contracting agent or
counsel shall not, at any time during the proposal solicitation process, convey
information, including price, to any potential vendor that may provide the
vendor an unfair advantage over any other potential vendor. If a change is made
to the proposal documentation, the contracting agent or counsel shall notify
only the potential vendors who received the proposal documentation of any and
all changes in writing and all existing documentation shall be changed
accordingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  All proposals and
contracts shall be subject to the provisions of section 1 of P.L.1977, c.33
(C.52:25-24.2) requiring submission of a statement of corporate ownership and
the provisions of P.L.1975, c.127 (C.10:5-31 et seq.) concerning equal
employment opportunity and affirmative action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  (New section) Competitive
contracting proposals shall be solicited in the following manner:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     A notice of the
availability of a request for proposals documentation shall be published in a
legal newspaper of the county college at least 20 days prior to the date
established for the submission of proposals. The county college shall promptly
reply to any request by an interested vendor by providing a copy of the request
for proposals. The county college may charge a fee for the proposal
documentation that shall not exceed $50 or the cost of reproducing the
documentation, whichever is greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Each interested vendor
shall submit a proposal which shall include all the information required by the
request for proposals. Failure to meet the requirements of the request for
proposals may result in the county college disqualifying the vendor from further
consideration. The provisions of a proposal shall not be subject to negotiation
by the county college.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If the county college,
at the time of solicitation, utilizes its own employees to provide the goods or
perform the services, or both, that are being considered for competitive
contracting, the county college shall, at any time prior to, but no later than
the time of solicitation for competitive contracting proposals, notify affected
employees of the county colleges intention to solicit competitive contracting
proposals. Employees or their representatives shall be permitted to submit
recommendations and proposals affecting wages, hours, and terms and conditions
of employment in a manner that meets the goals of the competitive contract. If
employees are represented by an organization that has negotiated a contract
with the county college, only the bargaining unit shall be authorized to submit
the recommendations or proposals. When requested by the employees, the county
college shall provide information regarding budgets and the costs of performing
the services by the employees, as may be available. Nothing shall prevent the
employees from making recommendations that may include modifications to
existing labor agreements in order to reduce costs in lieu of the award of a
competitive contract, and agreements implementing the recommendations may be
considered as cause for rejecting all other proposals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The contracting agent or
counsel shall evaluate all proposals only in accordance with the methodology
described in the request for proposals.  After proposals have been evaluated,
the contracting agent or counsel shall prepare a report evaluating and
recommending the award of a contract. The report shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  list the names of all
potential vendors who submitted a proposal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  summarize the proposals
of each vendor who submitted a proposal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  rank the vendors in order
of evaluation;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  recommend the selection
of a vendor or vendors, as appropriate, for a contract;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  be clear in the reasons
why the vendor or vendors have been selected among others considered;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  detail the terms,
conditions, scope of services, fees, and other matters to be incorporated into
a contract; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7) be made available to the
public at least 48 hours prior to the awarding of the contract, or when made
available to the board of trustees, whichever is sooner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The county college shall have
the right to reject all proposals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The report prepared
pursuant to subsection d. of this section shall become part of the public
record and shall reflect the final action of the county college.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  Award of a contract by a
county college utilizing competitive contracting shall be made, by resolution
of the board of trustees, within 60 days of the receipt of the proposals,
except that the proposals of any vendors who consent thereto, may, at the
request of the county college, be held for consideration for a longer period as
may be agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    All contracts awarded
through competitive contracting pursuant to the provisions of sections 6
through 10 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill) for the provision of goods or
performance of services shall be in writing. The board of trustees may, subject
to the requirements of law, prescribe the forms and manner that contracts shall
be made and executed, and the form and manner of the execution and approval of
all guarantee, indemnity, fidelity, and other bonds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The county college shall
publish a notice in the legal newspaper of the county college summarizing the
award of a contract, which shall include but not be limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the nature, duration, and

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) the name of the vendor;
