<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, county
clerks and municipal clerks are tasked with drawing the names of candidates and
groups of candidates from a box to determine the order in which the candidates
will appear on the ballot for the ensuing primary or general election. 
Multiple candidates for the same office who are grouped together on their
nominating petitions are drawn together.  For primary election ballots,
candidates for different offices may associate with one another and have their
collective ballot positions determined by the drawing for the first office. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill replaces the hand
drawing procedures with a computerized drawing system to determine the random
order of candidates.  The bill requires that, prior to the use of any
computerized system for this purpose, the Secretary of State must approve of
said system, and the system must be shown to have appropriate safeguards to
limit the potential for outside influence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also removes the
provisions that allow for candidates in the primary election to be placed on
the ballot according to the drawing of another candidate for another office, often
known as bracketing together, ensuring that each computerized drawing for
each office is independent of one another.  Multiple candidates running as a
group for the same office may still have their names drawn together as one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that the computerized drawing for ballot position will be viewable both in person
and electronically. </p>
