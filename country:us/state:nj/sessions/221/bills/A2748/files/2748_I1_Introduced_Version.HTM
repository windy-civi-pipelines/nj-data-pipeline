<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.33:1-12 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     33:1-12.  Class C licenses
shall be subdivided and classified as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Plenary retail consumption
license. 1. The holder of this license shall be entitled, subject to rules and
regulations, to sell any alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed
premises by the glass or other open receptacle, and also to sell any alcoholic
beverages in original containers for consumption off the licensed premises; but
this license shall not be issued to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages in
or upon any premises in which a grocery, delicatessen, drug store or other
mercantile business is carried on, except as hereinafter provided.  The holder
of this license shall be permitted to conduct consumer wine, beer and spirits
tasting events and samplings for a fee or on a complimentary basis pursuant to
conditions established by rules and regulations of the Division of Alcoholic
Beverage Control, provided however, that the holder of this license complies
with the terms and conditions set forth in section 3 of P.L.2009, c.216
(C.33:1-12d).  Subject to such rules and regulations established from time to
time by the director, the holder of this license shall be permitted to sell
alcoholic beverages in or upon the premises in which any of the following is
carried on: the keeping of a hotel or restaurant including the sale of
mercantile items incidental thereto as an accommodation to patrons; the sale,
at an entertainment facility as defined in R.S.33:1-1, having a seating
capacity for no less than 4,000 patrons, of mercantile items traditionally

packaged crackers, chips, nuts and similar snacks and ice at retail as an
accommodation to patrons, or the retail sale of nonalcoholic beverages as
accessory beverages to alcoholic beverages; or, in commercial bowling
establishments, the retail sale or rental of bowling accessories and the retail
sale from vending machines of candy, ice cream and nonalcoholic beverages.  The
fee for this license shall be fixed by the governing board or body of the
municipality in which the licensed premises are situated, by ordinance, at not
less than $250 and not more than $2,500. No ordinance shall be enacted which
shall raise or lower the fee to be charged for this license by more than 20%
from that charged in the preceding license year or $500.00, whichever is the
lesser.  The governing board or body of each municipality may, by ordinance,
enact that no plenary retail consumption license shall be granted within its
respective municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The holder of this license
shall be permitted to obtain a restricted brewery license issued pursuant to
subsection 1c. of R.S.33:1-10 and to operate a restricted brewery immediately
adjoining the licensed premises in accordance with the restrictions set forth
in that subsection.  All fees related to the issuance of both licenses shall be
paid in accordance with statutory law.</p>

2. The holder of this license shall be entitled, subject to rules and
regulations, to sell any alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed

beverages in original containers for consumption off the licensed premises,
during the summer season from May 1 until November 14, inclusive, or during the
winter season from November 15 until April 30, inclusive; but this license
shall not be issued to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages in or upon any
premises in which a grocery, delicatessen, drug store or other mercantile
business is carried on, except as hereinafter provided.  Subject to such rules
and regulations established from time to time by the director, the holder of
this license shall be permitted to sell alcoholic beverages in or upon the
premises in which any of the following is carried on: the keeping of a hotel or
restaurant including the sale of mercantile items incidental thereto as an
accommodation to patrons; the sale of distillers', brewers' and vintners'
packaged merchandise prepacked as a unit with other suitable objects as gift
items to be sold only as a unit; the sale of novelty wearing apparel identified
with the name of the establishment licensed under the provisions of this
section; the sale of cigars, cigarettes, packaged crackers, chips, nuts and
similar snacks and ice at retail as an accommodation to patrons; or the retail
sale of nonalcoholic beverages as accessory beverages to alcoholic beverages. 
The fee for this license shall be fixed by the governing board or body of the
municipality in which the licensed premises are situated, by ordinance, at 75%
of the fee fixed by said board or body for plenary retail consumption
licenses.  The governing board or body of each municipality may, by ordinance,
enact that no seasonal retail consumption license shall be granted within its
respective municipality.</p>
