<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill regulates consumer
legal funding providers.  Consumer legal funding is a transaction in which a
company purchases and a consumer sells to the company a contingent right to
receive an amount of the potential proceeds of a settlement, judgment, award,
or verdict obtained in the consumers legal claim for the consumers household
needs.  Under current law, consumer legal funding providers are largely
unregulated in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires consumer
legal funding contracts to: be completely filled in when presented to the
consumer for signature; contain, in bold and boxed type, a right of rescission,
allowing the consumer to cancel the contract without penalty or further
obligation within five business days after the funding date under certain
circumstances; and contain the initials of the consumer on each page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires consumer
legal funding contracts to contain a written acknowledgment by the attorney
retained by the consumer in the legal claim that attests to the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   to the best of the
attorneys knowledge, all the costs and charges relating to the consumer legal
funding have been disclosed to the consumer;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the attorney is being
paid on a contingency basis pursuant to a written fee agreement;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   all proceeds of the
legal claim will be disbursed via either the trust account or a settlement
fund;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   the attorney is
following the written instructions of the consumer with regard to the consumer
legal funding; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   the attorney has not and
will not receive a referral fee or other consideration from the consumer legal
funding company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that if the
written acknowledgment by the attorney is not complete, the contract is void. 
If the acknowledgement is completed, the contract will remain valid if the
consumer terminates the initial attorney or retains a new attorney with respect
to the legal claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a consumer
legal funding company shall not:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   pay or offer to pay
commissions, referral fees, or other forms of consideration for referring a
consumer to the company;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   accept any commissions,
referral fees, rebates, or other forms of consideration for the referral of
consumers;</p>

materially false or misleading information;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   refer, in furtherance of
an initial legal funding, a customer or potential customer to a specific attorney,
law firm, medical provider, chiropractor, or physical therapist or any of their
employees; provided, however, if a customer needs legal representation, the
company may refer the customer to a local or State bar association referral
service;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   fail to promptly supply
a copy of the executed contract to the attorney for the consumer;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   provide funding to a
consumer who has previously assigned or sold a portion of the consumers right
to proceeds under certain circumstances;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   receive any right to or
make any decisions with respect to the conduct of the underlying legal claim or
any settlement or resolution thereof; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   knowingly pay or offer
to pay for court costs, filing fees, or attorneys fees either during or after
the resolution of the legal claim, using funds from the consumer legal funding
transaction;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   charge a fee in an
amount greater than 40 percent of the funded amount in any 12-month period; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  charge any additional
administrative, origination, underwriting or other fees, except for a one time document
preparation fee, which shall be no greater than $500.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a consumer
legal funding company to require the contracted amount to be paid to the
company to be set as a predetermined amount based upon intervals of time from
the funding date through the resolution date, and not to be determined as a
percentage of the recovery from the legal claim.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires all consumer
legal funding contracts to contain certain disclosures.  The bill requires the
front page of the contract to contain language specifying the funded amount to
be paid to the consumer by the consumer legal funding company; an itemization
of one time charges; the total amount to be assigned by the consumer to the
company, including the funded amount and all charges; and a payment schedule. 
The contract must also contain disclosures on: the consumers right to
cancellation; how the company will be notified of a settlement; and the
consumer only being required to pay in the event that there are proceeds from
the legal claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that nothing
in it shall restrict the exercise of powers or the performance of the duties of
the Attorney General, which the Attorney General is authorized to exercise or
perform by law.  Under the bill, if a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that a consumer legal funding company has intentionally violated the
provisions of the bill with regard to a specific consumer legal funding, the
consumer legal funding company shall only be entitled to recover the funded
amount provided to the consumer in that specific consumer legal funding and
shall not be entitled to any additional charges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
contingent right to receive an amount of the potential proceeds of a legal
claim shall be assignable by a consumer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, an attorney or
law firm retained by the consumer in the legal claim may not have a financial
interest in the consumer legal funding company offering consumer legal funding
to that consumer.  Additionally, no communication between the consumers
attorney in the legal claim and the consumer legal funding company as it
pertains to the consumer legal funding shall limit, waive, or abrogate the
scope or nature of any statutory or common-law privilege, including the work-product
doctrine and the attorney-client privilege.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that unless
a consumer legal funding company has first registered with the Department of
Banking and Insurance, the company shall not engage in the business of consumer
legal funding, and provides for certain criteria for registration, such as the
payment of fees, maintenance of a bond, and investigation of the character and
fitness of the applicant.</p>
