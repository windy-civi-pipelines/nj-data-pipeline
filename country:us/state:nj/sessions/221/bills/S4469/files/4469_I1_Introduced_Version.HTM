<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known
and may be cited as the New Jersey Loves New Jersey Farmers Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a. A taxpayer that is a
commercial farm operator shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed
pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) in an amount equal to the
price loss of the commercial farm during the privilege period, provided that
the taxpayer obtains a certification of the price loss for the privilege period
from the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to section 4 of
P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The order of priority of
the application of the credit allowed pursuant to this section, and any other
credits allowed by law against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), shall be as prescribed by the director.  The
amount of the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed
pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period,
together with any other credits allowed by law, shall not exceed 50 percent of
the tax liability otherwise due and shall not reduce the tax liability to an
amount lower than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5
of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  The amount of the tax credit otherwise
allowable under this section which cannot be applied for the privilege period
due to the limitations of this subsection or under other provisions of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) may be carried forward, if necessary, to
the seven privilege periods following the privilege period for which the tax
credit was issued, after which the tax credit shall expire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     No tax credit shall be
allowed pursuant to this section for any costs or expenses included in the
calculation of any other tax credit or exemption granted pursuant to a claim
made on a tax return filed with the director, or included in the calculation of
an award of business assistance or incentive, for a period of time that
coincides with the privilege period for which a tax credit authorized pursuant
to this section is allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    When filing a return
that includes a claim for a tax credit allowed pursuant to this section, a
taxpayer shall include a copy of the certification issued by the secretary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     (1) A taxpayer that
obtains a certification of the price loss from the Secretary of Agriculture
pursuant to section 4 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill) may apply to the director for a
tax credit transfer certificate in lieu of the taxpayer being allowed any
amount of tax credit against the tax liability of the taxpayer, as authorized under
this section. The tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by the
taxpayer from the director, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part, in the
privilege period during which the taxpayer receives the tax credit transfer
certificate from the director, to another person, who may apply the credit
against a tax liability under the tax pursuant to the Corporation Business Tax
Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.), or the New Jersey Gross
Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.  The certificate provided to the
taxpayer shall include a statement waiving the taxpayers right to claim the
amount of the credit that the taxpayer has elected to sell or assign against
the tax for a tax liability.  The tax credit certificate issued to a taxpayer
by the director shall be subject to any terms and conditions that the director
may prescribe; provided, however, that the holder of a tax credit certificate
may transfer all or part of the tax credit amount, on or after the date of
issuance of the tax credit transfer certificate, for use by the transferee in
the tax period for which it was issued, in the tax period in which it was
issued, or in any of the next three successive tax periods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The tax credit
certificate holder or transferee may first use the credit against tax
liabilities in the tax period in which it was issued or a succeeding tax
period, as authorized in this section, without the need to amend the tax return
for the tax period for which the credit was issued, subject to the provisions
of this subsection. A transferee may carry forward an unused credit for use in
any of the next five successive tax periods, and the unused credit shall expire
thereafter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     As used in this
section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commercial farm means a
commercial farm, as that term is defined by section 3 of P.L.1983, c.31
(C.4:1C-3), located in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commercial farm operator

not distributed, of the total distributive income or gain of the entity for its
taxable year ending within or with the taxpayers taxable year.</p>

by the taxpayer from the director, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part,
in the taxable year during which the taxpayer receives the tax credit transfer
certificate from the director, to another person, who may apply the credit
against a tax liability under the tax pursuant to the Corporation Business Tax
Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.), or the New Jersey Gross
Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.  The certificate provided to the
taxpayer shall include a statement waiving the taxpayers right to claim the
amount of the credit that the taxpayer has elected to sell or assign against
the tax for a tax liability.  The tax credit certificate issued to a taxpayer

may prescribe; provided, however, that the holder of a tax credit certificate
may transfer all or part of the tax credit amount, on or after the date of
issuance of the tax credit transfer certificate, for use by the transferee in
the tax period for which it was issued, in the tax period in which it was

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, which is designated
as the New Jersey Loves New Jersey Farmers Act, provides corporation business
tax credits and gross income tax credits to commercial farm operators in an
amount equal to the price loss of New Jersey commercial farm products, as
determined by the Secretary of Agriculture (secretary).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a commercial
farm operator is allowed a tax credit based on the price loss of New Jersey
commercial farm products sold during a tax period.  As defined in the bill,
New Jersey commercial farm product means a crop, including, but not limited
to, a fruit or vegetable, harvested for human consumption from a commercial
farm.  A commercial farm operator means the taxpayer primarily responsible for
the on-site day-to-day operation of a commercial farm, at which New Jersey
commercial farm products are planted, managed, and harvested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines price loss
to mean the difference between the baseline receipts and actual receipts for a
New Jersey commercial farm product, provided that the amount of the actual
receipts is lower than amount of the baseline receipts.  Under the bill,
actual receipts is defined to mean the sum of the actual amounts, in dollars,
that a commercial farm operator received in compensation for each unit of a New
Jersey commercial farm product sold during the tax period.  In contract,
baseline receipts means the sum of the total number of units of a New Jersey
commercial farm product sold during the tax year, multiplied by the monthly reference
price for the month in which each unit was sold.  The bill defines monthly
reference price as the average amount, in dollars, as determined by the secretary,
that a commercial farm operator should fairly receive in compensation for each
unit of a New Jersey commercial farm product sold during that specific month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
secretary to accept and review applications for the certification of a
commercial farm operators price loss during a tax period.  A commercial farm
operator may submit an application for certification of the price loss for a
single New Jersey commercial farm product or the total price loss for multiple
New Jersey commercial farm products.  In addition to such other information and
documentation that the secretary may deem necessary, an application for the
certification of price loss is required to include: (1) business records of a
commercial farm operator demonstrating the actual receipts of each New Jersey
commercial farm product for which the commercial farm operator seeks
certification of price loss; and (2) an indication of the dates beginning and
ending the tax period for which the application is made and calculation of the
baseline receipts for that tax period.  The secretary is also required under
the bill to calculate and publish the monthly reference price for each month of
a calendar year, as described in the bill, within 90 days following the final
day of that month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, any amount of
any unused tax credit may be carried forward to the seven tax periods following
the year for which the tax credit was issued, after which the tax credit
expires.  The bill requires the Director of the Division of Taxation to
determine the form and manner by which a taxpayer can apply for the tax credit,
coordinating with the secretary as necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to authorizing tax
credits for commercial farm operators, the bill also permits the operators to
apply for a tax credit transfer certificate so that part or all of the credit
awarded may be sold or assigned in the tax period during which the tax credit
transfer certificate is received.  The bill provides that a transferee may use
the tax credit transfer certificate in the tax period for which it was issued,
in the tax period in which it was issued, or in any of the next three
successive tax periods.  The transferee is permitted to use the credit against
tax liabilities in the tax period in which it was issued or in a succeeding tax
period, as authorized in the bill, without the need to amend the tax return for
the tax period for which the credit was issued.  The bill authorizes a
transferee to carry forward an unused credit for use in any of the next five
successive tax periods, and the unused credit expires thereafter.</p>
