municipal governing body, a regular municipal election conducted in May.
Pursuant to the provisions of this act and Title 19 of the Revised Statutes and
in accordance with procedures that may be established by the Secretary of State
for verifying eligible voters, each county board of elections shall verify that
a registered voter is qualified to vote in the election and shall prescribe the
manner by which a registered voter may vote during such period.</p>

for early voting to occur, except that the county board shall designate at
least five, but not more than seven, public locations for early voting if the
number of registered voters in the county is at least 150,000 but less than
300,000, and shall designate at least seven, but not more than 10, public
locations for early voting if the number of registered voters in the county is
300,000 or more. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent county
boards of elections, at their discretion, from establishing additional
locations in excess of the five, seven, or 10 location limits respectively set
forth herein; provided, however, that the State shall be required to provide
reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and including the five, seven,
or 10 respective limits established herein, and shall not be required to provide
reimbursement for additional locations beyond those limits under section 6 of
this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  The number of registered voters in each
county shall be determined ahead of the selection of early voting sites
pursuant to a uniform standard which shall be developed by the Secretary of
State through the rulemaking process pursuant to the &quot;Administrative
Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).  Whenever possible,
early voting locations shall be geographically located so as to ensure both
access in the part of the county that features the greatest concentration of
population, according to the most recent federal decennial census of the United
States, and access in various geographic areas of the county.  All early voting
locations shall be public facilities, such as county courthouses, public
libraries and the offices of the municipal clerk, county clerk, and county
board of elections, or places of public accommodation as provided under Title
10 of the Revised Statutes. No public school building and no building used as a
public school, as that term is defined under N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall, however, be
designated as an early voting location.  The locations shall be designated at
the same time as all other polling places are designated by the board of
elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members of the county board with
respect to the selection of sites for early voting, the county clerk shall cast
the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are designated in each county,
county boards of election shall evaluate and, if deemed necessary, revise these
locations in order to accommodate significant changes in the number of
registered voters within each county, reflect the population distribution and
density within each county, or because of similar circumstances.  The Secretary
of State may develop the criteria to be used by county boards of election to
revise the location of early voting sites and shall prescribe how often such
revision shall take place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A voter shall be permitted to
vote at any early voting site in the voter's county.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Whenever a municipality
that conducts regular municipal elections in May chooses to participate in
early voting for the regular municipal election, the county board of elections
shall designate at least one public location, but not more than three public
locations, within the municipality as the site or sites for early voting to
occur. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent a county board of
elections, at its discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess
of the three location limit set forth herein; provided, however, that the State
shall be required to provide reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and
including the three location limit established herein, and shall not be
required to provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond that limit
under section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  Whenever possible,
each such location shall be geographically located in the part of the municipality
that features the greatest concentration of population, according to the most
recent federal decennial census of the United States.  All early voting
locations shall be public facilities, such as municipal courthouses and the
offices of the municipal clerk, or places of public accommodation as provided

officers shall be the same as provided to district board of election members
serving at a school election pursuant to R.S.19:45-6, or that required pursuant

the voter's record in the Statewide voter registration system to indicate that
a voter has voted in that election using the early voting procedure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  (1)  Each county board
shall be responsible for forming and executing a written plan to ensure, to the
greatest extent possible, the integrity of the voting process and the security
of ballots used during the early voting period, including the security of
voting machines, voted ballots, and election records.  The plan shall be based
on guidelines established by the Secretary of State and shall be submitted
thereto no later than December 15 of each year.  The Secretary of State shall
review and, if deemed necessary thereby, require changes to a plan no later
than February 1 of each year.  Each plan shall specify a chain of custody and
security plan for the voting machines, and a chain of custody for the voted
ballots and election records and materials, and shall require, among other
specifications deemed necessary by the Secretary of State and county boards of
election, that all voted ballots shall be transferred at the end of each early
voting day to county boards of election for safekeeping.  After the voted
ballots are transferred to the county board of elections at the end of each
early voting day, a county board may elect to impound those voted ballots on a
secure server, or by any other means deemed appropriate by the Secretary of
State.  The voted ballots shall not be canvassed until the closing of the polls
on election day as required pursuant to section 4 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40
(C.19:15A-4). The results of the voted ballots cast during early voting shall
remain confidential and shall be disclosed only in accordance with the
provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, regulations, and guidelines
concerning the disclosure of election results, and a violation shall be subject
to the penalties established by law.</p>

of State within 30 days following the effective date of this act and the
Secretary of State shall review it and, if deemed necessary thereby, require
changes in the plan within 45 days following the effective date of this act.</p>

make certain that each polling place used for early voting shall be accessible
to individuals with disabilities and the elderly, in compliance with the
&quot;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990&quot; (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et
seq.), and that each polling place provides such voters, including the blind
and visually impaired, the same opportunity for access and participation,
including privacy and independence, as other voters in compliance with the

tablet, or other electronic device to print provisional ballots for voters
required to vote by provisional ballot in accordance with the provisions of
Title 19 of the Revised Statutes or due to an equipment malfunction as further
provided under section 3 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-37), or any other election
related material, if needed.  A computer, tablet, or other electronic device
and the printer used to print election materials at a polling place shall not
be used unless it has been certified by the Secretary of State.  The Secretary
of State shall adopt and publish standards and regulations governing the
certification and use of computer, tablets, or other electronic devices and
printers to print election materials at each polling place used for early
voting.  The Secretary of State shall not certify a computer, tablet, or other
electronic device or printer unless it is in compliance with the secretary's
standards.</p>
