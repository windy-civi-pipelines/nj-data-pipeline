In 2023, the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing reported that the States healthcare workforce could lose 10,000 nurses over the next few years and that 9 out of 10 nursing programs are unable to enroll additional students due to lack of faculty nurses. In the face of workforce shortages and relentless public health crises, nurses have continually shown up and given back to the community.  For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic while many individuals were able to work remotely, nurses appeared in person to perform lifesaving services.  New Jersey seeks to honor nurses from every walk of life as they have so valiantly provided indispensable care to residents throughout the State.
