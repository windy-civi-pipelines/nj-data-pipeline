This act shall take effect on January 1 next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill designates September 11 of each year a State holiday, which will be known as 9/11 Remembrance Day. On September 11, 2001, the United States was attacked by the terrorist group, al-Qaeda, with four hijacked commercial airplanes.  Nearly 3,000 people were killed and thousands more were injured where planes crashed at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and in a field in Pennsylvania.  Approximately 750 New Jerseyans lost their lives that day and the death toll is still rising 20 years later, as some of those who selflessly worked at Ground Zero after the attacks are dying from illnesses caused by exposure to the variety of poisonous materials at the site.  Many lives are owed to the first responders who courageously sacrificed their lives and health in order to bring others to safety.  Over 150 memorials in the form of gardens, statues, plaques, and monuments have been installed all over the State of New Jersey in the years since the attacks, but establishing a State holiday would allow for a day of reflection for New Jerseyans. On this holiday, the State will recognize the victims of the terror attacks and the bravery and selflessness of the first responders and volunteers who responded in the wake of those attacks.
