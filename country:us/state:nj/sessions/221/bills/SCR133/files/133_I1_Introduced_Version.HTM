A Concurrent Resolution urging Congress to pass the Fix Our Forests Act. Whereas, New Jerseys forests cover 40 percent of the land in the State and are home to a rich habitat of diverse species; and Whereas, Residents enjoy connecting with nature in this States forests through a range of activities, including hiking, biking, camping, picnicking, fishing, swimming, boating, and hunting; and Whereas, On average, 1,500 wildfires damage or destroy 7,000 acres of New Jerseys forests each year; and Whereas, Wildfires not only damage forests and the habitats of countless wildlife, but also threaten homes and businesses and jeopardize the health and wellbeing of homeowners who live within or near the States forests; and Whereas, Hot, dry, or windy days increase the likelihood of wildfires, and New Jersey has experienced an increase in these conditions; and Whereas, New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the nation, leaving more residents increasingly at risk of being in the path of a wildfire; and Whereas, The Fix Our Forests Act, currently pending in the United States Congress, would create an interagency Fireshed Center to use data to assess and predict wildfire risk to help inform land and fuels management, community and public health risk reduction, fire response, and post-fire recovery activities; and Whereas, A data-driven approach to assessing wildfire risk would help this State make strategic decisions about land management practices and take actions that are most likely to decrease the risk and severity of wildfires; and Whereas, Forest fire management techniques vary broadly and can include using prescribed fires to reduce brush that fuels wildfires, thinning the number of trees through accepted forest management practices, minimizing the spread of diseases and insects, and building resilience in at-risk communities; and Whereas, The Fix Our Forests Act would also facilitate environmental reviews for accepted forest management practices, limit litigation involving fireshed management projects, promote livestock grazing in forests, require a study on pine beetle infestations, and promote strategies to strengthen the domestic seed supply; and Whereas, Reducing the risk of wildfires and improving the resilience of New Jerseys forests is more important than ever before; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey (the General Assembly concurring): 1. The Legislature of the State of New Jersey respectfully urges Congress to pass the Fix Our Forests Act. 2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and every member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution urges Congress to pass the Fix Our Forests Act.  On average, 1,500 wildfires damage or destroy 7,000 acres of New Jerseys forests each year.  In addition to damaging the States forests and wildlife habitats, wildfires also threaten homes and businesses and jeopardize the health and wellbeing of people who live or recreate within or near the States forests. The considerable number of hot, dry, or windy days that New Jersey has been experiencing increases the likelihood of wildfires.  As the most densely populated state in the country, New Jersey residents are increasingly at risk of being near a wildfire. The Fix Our Forests Act, currently pending in the United States Congress would create an interagency Fireshed Center to use data to assess and predict wildfire risk to help inform wildfire reduction activities.  A data-driven approach to assessing wildfire risk could help this State make strategic decisions about land management practices and take actions that are most likely to decrease the risk of wildfires.  Forest fire management techniques vary broadly and can include using prescribed fires to reduce brush that fuels wildfires, thinning the number of trees through accepted forest management practices, minimizing the spread of diseases and insects, and building resilience in at-risk communities.  The Fix Our Forests Act would facilitate environmental reviews for accepted forest management practices, limit litigation involving fireshed management projects, promote livestock grazing in forests, require a study on pine beetle infestations, and promote strategies to strengthen the domestic seed supply.
