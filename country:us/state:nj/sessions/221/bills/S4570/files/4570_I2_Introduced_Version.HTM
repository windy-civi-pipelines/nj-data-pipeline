<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   net metering standards
for electric power suppliers and basic generation service providers.  The
standards shall require electric power suppliers and basic generation service
providers to offer net metering at non-discriminatory rates to industrial,
large commercial, residential and small commercial customers, as those
customers are classified or defined by the board, that generate electricity, on
the customer's side of the meter, using a Class I renewable energy source, for
the net amount of electricity supplied by the electric power supplier or basic
generation service provider over an annualized period.  Systems of any sized
capacity, as measured in watts, are eligible for net metering.  If the amount
of electricity generated by the customer-generator, plus any kilowatt hour
credits held over from the previous billing periods, exceeds the electricity
supplied by the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider,
then the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider, as the
case may be, shall credit the customer-generator for the excess kilowatt hours
until the end of the annualized period at which point the customer-generator
will be compensated for any remaining credits or, if the customer-generator chooses,
credit the customer-generator on a real-time basis, at the electric power
supplier's or basic generation service provider's avoided cost of wholesale
power or the PJM electric power pool's real-time locational marginal pricing
rate, adjusted for losses, for the respective zone in the PJM electric power
pool.  Alternatively, the customer-generator may execute a bilateral agreement
with an electric power supplier or basic generation service provider for the
sale and purchase of the customer-generator's excess generation.  The
customer-generator may be credited on a real-time basis, so long as the
customer-generator follows applicable rules prescribed by the PJM electric
power pool for its capacity requirements for the net amount of electricity
supplied by the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider. 
The board may authorize an electric power supplier or basic generation service
provider to cease offering net metering to customers that are not already net
metered whenever the total rated generating capacity owned and operated by net
metering customer-generators Statewide equals 5.8 percent of the total annual
kilowatt-hours sold in this State by each electric power supplier and each
basic generation service provider during the prior one-year period;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   safety and power quality
interconnection standards for Class I renewable energy source systems used by a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Such standards or rules shall
take into consideration the goals of the New Jersey Energy Master Plan,
applicable industry standards, and the standards of other states and the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  The board shall allow
electric public utilities to recover the costs of any new net meters, upgraded
net meters, system reinforcements or upgrades, and interconnection costs
through either their regulated rates or from the net metering
customer-generator; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   credit or other

that connect to New Jersey's electric public utilities' distribution system but
who do not net meter; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   net metering aggregation
standards to require electric public utilities to provide net metering
aggregation to single electric public utility customers that operate a solar
electric power generation system installed at one of the customer's facilities
or on property owned by the customer, provided that any such customer is a
State entity, school district, county, county agency, county authority,
municipality, municipal agency, or municipal authority.  The standards shall
provide that, in order to qualify for net metering aggregation, the customer
must operate a solar electric power generation system using a net metering
billing account, which system is located on property owned by the customer,
provided that: (a) the property is not land that has been actively devoted to
agricultural or horticultural use and that is valued, assessed, and taxed
pursuant to the &quot;Farmland Assessment Act of 1964,&quot; P.L.1964, c.48
(C.54:4-23.1 et seq.) at any time within the 10-year period prior to the
effective date of P.L.2012, c.24, provided, however, that the municipal
planning board of a municipality in which a solar electric power generation
system is located may waive the requirement of this subparagraph (a), (b) the
system is not an on-site generation facility, (c) all of the facilities of the
single customer combined for the purpose of net metering aggregation are
facilities owned or operated by the single customer and are located within its
territorial jurisdiction except that all of the facilities of a State entity
engaged in net metering aggregation shall be located within five miles of one
another, and (d) all of those facilities are within the service territory of a
single electric public utility and are all served by the same basic generation
service provider or by the same electric power supplier.  The standards shall
provide that, in order to qualify for net metering aggregation, the customer's
solar electric power generation system shall be sized so that its annual
generation does not exceed the combined metered annual energy usage of the
qualified customer facilities, and the qualified customer facilities shall all
be in the same customer rate class under the applicable electric public utility
tariff.  For the customer's facility or property on which the solar electric
generation system is installed, the electricity generated from the customer's
solar electric generation system shall be accounted for pursuant to the
provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection to provide that the electricity
generated in excess of the electricity supplied by the electric power supplier
or the basic generation service provider, as the case may be, for the
customer's facility on which the solar electric generation system is installed,
over the annualized period, is credited at the electric power supplier's or the
basic generation service provider's avoided cost of wholesale power or the PJM
electric power pool real-time locational marginal pricing rate.  All
electricity used by the customer's qualified facilities, with the exception of
the facility or property on which the solar electric power generation system is
installed, shall be billed at the full retail rate pursuant to the electric
public utility tariff applicable to the customer class of the customer using
the electricity.  A customer may contract with a third party to operate a solar
electric power generation system, for the purpose of net metering aggregation. 
Any contractual relationship entered into for operation of a solar electric
power generation system related to net metering aggregation shall include
contractual protections that provide for adequate performance and provision for
construction and operation for the term of the contract, including any
appropriate bonding or escrow requirements.  Any incremental cost to an
electric public utility for net metering aggregation shall be fully and timely
recovered in a manner to be determined by the board.  The board shall adopt net
metering aggregation standards within 270 days after the effective date of
P.L.2012, c.24. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.    Section 1 of P.L.2018,
c.16 (C.48:3-87.3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a. The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Climate change is one of
the greatest threats facing the State today and in the future.  Reducing
emissions of carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, and other pollutants by
preserving and expanding zero-emission electricity generation within and
outside the State is critical to mitigating the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Nuclear power is a
reliable, zero-emission source of energy that has supplied New Jersey's energy
demands for decades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   New Jersey has
historically relied on a diverse mix of energy supply sources, including
nuclear power, to meet the needs of its residents and businesses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Reducing emissions of
carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, and other pollutants, and preserving
and developing zero-emission electricity generation sources within and outside
the State that currently provide electricity to customers in New Jersey, are
critical to improving air quality for New Jersey residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   The Energy Master Plan
of New Jersey, last updated in 2015, requires significant revisions to ensure
that 100 percent of the State's electric energy needs are generated by clean
energy sources by 2050, and any update to the Energy Master Plan by the State
must include a focus on the expansion of renewable and zero-emission sources of
energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The existing renewable
energy portfolio standard has been successful in promoting the growth of
renewable energy generation to reduce air pollution in New Jersey; however, to
achieve its near term environmental goals, New Jersey must expand its
commitment to zero-emission energy generation and value the air quality and
other environmental attributes of zero-emission generation sources that
currently fall outside the scope of the existing renewable energy portfolio
standard, including but not limited to nuclear power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Nuclear power generation
is a critical component of the State's clean energy portfolio because nuclear
power plants do not emit carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, or other
pollutants; in addition, nuclear power is an important element of a diverse
energy generation portfolio that currently meets approximately 40 percent of
New Jersey's electric power needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   Several of the existing,
licensed, and operating nuclear power plants within and outside the State that
currently provide electricity to customers in New Jersey are at risk of abrupt
retirement due to a variety of factors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   The retirement of
nuclear power generation will inevitably result in an immediate increase in air
emissions within New Jersey due to increased reliance on natural gas-fired
generation and coal-fired generation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10) Poor air quality has a
disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable citizens of New Jersey including
children, the elderly, and people living in poverty.  Fossil-fuel power plants
drive increases in pollutants like ground-level ozone, which aggravates
respiratory illnesses for individuals with decreased lung function.  Public
health and environmental justice necessitate a reduction in these pollutants to
protect the most vulnerable of our citizenry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11) As a coastal state, New
Jersey is particularly exposed to many of the effects of global climate change,
such as rising sea levels and more extreme storms.  Many of New Jersey's most
important commercial and tourism assets are located in coastal areas, and
events like Superstorm Sandy have demonstrated the imminent and tangible
threats that intense storms pose to New Jersey's economy and environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (12) Given the overwhelming
scientific consensus that fossil-fuel use is causing potentially irreversible
global climate change and the attendant environmental catastrophes, it is a
moral imperative that the State invest in energy infrastructure within and
outside the State that does not produce greenhouse gases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Legislature
therefore determines that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The abrupt retirement of
existing, licensed, and operating nuclear power plants within and outside the
State that provide electricity to customers in New Jersey, and any concomitant
increase in the proportion of New Jersey's electricity demand met by natural
gas and coal, will result in a substantial increase in emissions of several
serious pollutants, and associated adverse public health and environmental
impacts.  The pollutants resulting from increased fossil-fuel generation and
drilling include emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, sulfur
dioxide, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, mercury, and nitrous
oxides, and the creation of ozone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   New Jersey is currently
not projected to meet certain federal and State air quality standards and
emissions level requirements, counties of the State are currently designated as
nonattainment for the federal 8-hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality
Standard, and the abrupt retirement of nuclear power plants that serve New
Jersey combined with increased reliance on natural gas-fired and coal-fired
generation will substantially impede the State's ability to meet those federal
and State air quality standards and emissions level requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   In light of the primacy
of natural gas use for heating in New Jersey, increased reliance on natural
gas-fired generation will render the electric generation and delivery systems
less resilient and more vulnerable to the impacts of extreme winter weather
events, natural gas pipeline accidents, and other factors affecting the
deliverability of natural gas to electric power generating stations in and
around the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The model of providing
credits to zero- or low-emission energy generation sources as compensation for
their environmental attributes has proven successful for Class I and Class II
renewable energy sources, which receive renewable energy certificates, and
solar electric power generators, which receive solar renewable energy
certificates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   A program that
recognizes and compensates nuclear energy generators in a manner similar to
other non-emitting energy generation resources to the extent required to
prevent the loss of nuclear energy, subject to independent review as provided
in section 3 of <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>this

approximately 40 percent of their electricity needs, could, in the absence of
equally or more cost-effective clean energy alternatives, further the State's
interest in environmental protection and maintaining a diverse mix of energy
sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   While recognizing the
importance of nuclear energy generation, the State must also commit to the
deployment of renewable and zero-emission energy to address climate change,
drive economic development, and create new employment opportunities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   <b><span

vehicle makes and models will be introduced in the State motor vehicle market
over the next several years; that vehicle electrification offers a wide range
of benefits, such as improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions,
and savings in motor vehicle operating costs for vehicle owners; that increased

described in subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 3 of
P.L.2022, c.75 (C.52:27D-489i1).  Applications for tax credits pursuant to this
subsection relating to an ancillary infrastructure project or infrastructure
improvement in the public right-of-way, or both, shall be accompanied with a
letter of support relating to the project or improvement by the governing body
or agency in which the project is located.  Credits awarded to a developer
pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the same financial and related
analysis by the authority, the same term of the grant, and the same mechanism
for administering the credits, and shall be utilized or transferred by the
developer as if the credits had been awarded to the developer pursuant to
section 35 of P.L.2009, c.90 (C.34:1B-209.3) for qualified residential projects
thereunder.  No portion of the revenues pledged pursuant to the &quot;New
Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013,&quot; P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p
et al.) shall be subject to withholding or retainage for adjustment, in the
event the developer or taxpayer waives its rights to claim a refund thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    The developer of a
project seeking an award of credits for a project restricted under subparagraph
(g) of this paragraph shall submit an incentive grant application prior to
December 31, 2021, and if approved after the effective date of P.L.2020, c.156
(C.34:1B-269 et al.), shall submit a temporary certificate of occupancy for the
project no later than December 31, 2024.  In addition to the requirements for
an award of credits set forth in P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-489a et al.), a
developer shall be eligible to receive an award of credits for a project
restricted under subparagraph (g) of this paragraph only if the developer
demonstrates to the authority at that time of application that: (i) the project
shall comply with minimum environmental and sustainability standards; (ii) the
project shall comply with the authority's affirmative action requirements,
adopted pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1979, c.303 (C.34:1B-5.4); (iii) each
worker employed by the developer or subcontractor of a developer working at the
project shall be paid not less than $15 per hour or 120 percent of the minimum
wage fixed under subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1966, c.113 (C.34:11-56a4),
whichever is higher; and (iv) during the eligibility period, each worker
employed to perform construction work or building services work at the project
shall be paid not less than the prevailing wage rate for the worker's craft or
trade, as determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development
pursuant to P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) and P.L.2005, c.379
(C.34:11-56.58 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Prior to the board considering
an application submitted by a developer for a project restricted under
subparagraph (g) of this paragraph, the authority shall confirm with the
Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental
Protection, and the Department of the Treasury whether the developer is in
substantial good standing with the respective department, or has entered into
an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical
corrective action plan for the developer.  The developer, or an authorized
agent of the developer, shall certify to the authority that all factual
assertions made in the developer's application are true under the penalty of
perjury.  If at any time the authority determines that the developer made a
material misrepresentation on the developer's application, the developer shall
forfeit the award of credits and the authority shall recapture any tax credits
awarded to the developer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A developer may apply to
the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury and
the chief executive officer of the authority for a tax credit transfer
certificate, if the developer is awarded a tax credit pursuant to paragraph (2)
or paragraph (3) of this subsection, covering one or more years, in lieu of the
developer being allowed any amount of the credit against the tax liability of
the developer.  The tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by
the developer from the director and the chief executive officer of the
authority, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part, to any other person who
may have a tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5),
sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), section 1 of
P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5.  The certificate provided to
the developer shall include a statement waiving the developer's right to claim
that amount of the credit against the taxes that the developer has elected to
sell or assign.  The sale or assignment of any amount of a tax credit transfer
certificate allowed under this paragraph shall not be exchanged for
consideration received by the developer of less than 75 percent of the
transferred credit amount before considering any further discounting to present
value that may be permitted.  Any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate
used by a purchaser or assignee against a tax liability shall be subject to the
same limitations and conditions that apply to the use of the credit by the
developer who originally applied for and was allowed the credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     All administrative
costs associated with the incentive grant shall be assessed to the applicant
and be retained by the State Treasurer from the annual incentive grant
payments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The incremental revenue
for the revenues listed in subsection a. of this section shall be calculated as
the difference between the amount collected in any fiscal year from any
eligible revenue source included in the State redevelopment incentive grant
agreement, less the revenue increment base for that eligible revenue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The municipality is

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would withdraw New
Jerseys involvement in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), repeal
the Global Warming Response Act, and amend various sections of statutory law
related to its implementation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would direct the
Commissioner of Environmental Protection to issue a Notice of Withdrawal to the
RGGI Memorandum of Understanding in order to formally revoke New Jerseys
agreement to participate in the RGGI program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would also repeal
the Global Warming Response Act, 26 P.L.2007, c.112 (C.26:2C-37 et al.), and
related sections of 27 P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-45 et al.), which is commonly
referred to as the RGGI implementing law.  The bill would amend various
sections of the statutory law in order to remove any references to the acts
being repealed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would retain section
13 of the RGGI implementing law, as well as subsections g. and h. of 33
P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-87), which were added to that section of law by the
Global Warming Response Act, since these provisions do not relate to the
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and instead provide only for the
discretionary investment, funding, and adoption of energy efficiency and
renewable energy programs and standards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also transfer
to the General Fund all of the unencumbered moneys in the Global Warming
Solutions Fund, which was established pursuant to the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative implementing law.  The funds are to be made available for ratepayer
relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would amend
the laws establishing the States Forest Stewardship Incentive Fund, the
States Plug-in Electric Vehicle Incentive Fund, and the States three-year
Electric School Bus Program (which commenced in 2023), in order to remove the
provisions of those laws that previously authorized the use of moneys in the
Global Warming Solutions Fund.  In addition, the bill would clarify that a
developer operating under a redevelopment incentive grant agreement will not be
eligible to receive payment, from the State Treasurer, for charges that were
paid thereby, prior to this bills effective date, in compliance with the
Global Warming Response Act.</p>
