contracts purchased by the commission pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of
P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.28) shall provide separate coverages or policies as
follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Basic benefits which
shall include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   Hospital benefits,
including outpatient;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Surgical benefits;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Inpatient medical
benefits;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Obstetrical benefits;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   Services rendered by an
extended care facility or by a home health agency and for specified medical
care visits by a physician during an eligible period of such services, without
regard to whether the patient has been hospitalized, to the extent and subject
to the conditions and limitations agreed to by the commission and the carrier
or carriers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Basic benefits shall be
substantially equivalent to those available on a group remittance basis to
employees of the State and their dependents under the subscription contracts of
the New Jersey &quot;Blue Cross&quot; and &quot;Blue Shield&quot; Plans. Such
basic benefits shall include benefits for:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    Additional days of
inpatient medical service;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   Surgery elsewhere than

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>and the extended basic benefits
shall be subject to the same conditions and limitations, applicable to such
benefits, as are set forth in &quot;Extended Outpatient Hospital Benefits
Rider,&quot; Form 1500, 71(9-66), and in &quot;Extended Benefit Rider&quot; (as
amended), Form MS 7050J(9-66) issued by the New Jersey &quot;Blue Cross&quot;
and &quot;Blue Shield&quot; Plans, respectively, and as the same may be amended
or superseded, subject to filing by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Major medical expense
benefits which shall provide benefit payments for reasonable and necessary
eligible medical expenses for hospitalization, surgery, medical treatment and
other related services and supplies to the extent they are not covered by basic</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>benefits. The commission may, by
regulation, determine what types of services and supplies shall be included as
&quot;eligible medical services&quot; under the major medical expense benefits
coverage as well as those which shall be excluded from or limited under such
coverage. Benefit payments for major medical expense benefits shall be equal to
a percentage of the reasonable charges for eligible medical services incurred
by a covered employee or an employee's covered dependent, during a calendar
year as exceed a deductible for such calendar year of $100.00 subject to the
maximums hereinafter provided and to the other terms and conditions authorized
by this act. The percentage shall be 80% of the first $2,000.00 of charges for
eligible medical services incurred subsequent to satisfaction of the deductible
and 100% thereafter. There shall be a separate deductible for each calendar
year for (a) each enrolled employee and (b) all enrolled dependents of such
employee. Not more than $1,000,000.00 shall be paid for major medical expense
benefits with respect to any one person for the entire period of such person's
coverage under the plan, whether continuous or interrupted except that this
maximum may be reapplied to a covered person in amounts not to exceed $2,000.00
a year. Maximums of $10,000.00 per calendar year and $20,000.00 for the entire
period of the person's coverage under the plan shall apply to eligible expenses
incurred because of mental illness or functional nervous disorders, and such
may be reapplied to a covered person, except as provided in P.L.1999, c.441
(C.52:14-17.29d et al.). The same provisions shall apply for retired employees
and their dependents. Under the conditions agreed upon by the commission and
the carriers as set forth in the contract, the deductible for a calendar year
may be satisfied in whole or in part by eligible charges incurred during the
last three months of the prior calendar year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any service determined by
regulation of the commission to be an &quot;eligible medical service&quot;
under the major medical expense benefits coverage which is performed by a duly
licensed practicing psychologist within the lawful scope of his practice shall
be recognized for reimbursement under the same conditions as would apply were
such service performed by a physician.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B)  The contract or contracts
purchased by the commission pursuant to subsection c. of section 4 of P.L.1961,
c.49 (C.52:14-17.28) shall include coverage for services and benefits that are
at a level that is equal to or exceeds the level of services and benefits set
forth in this subsection, provided that such services and benefits shall
include only those that are eligible medical services and not those deemed
experimental, investigative or otherwise not eligible medical services. The
determination of whether services or benefits are eligible medical services
shall be made by the commission consistent with the best interests of the State
and participating employers, employees, and dependents. The following list of
services is not intended to be exclusive or to require that any limits or
exclusions be exceeded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Covered services shall
