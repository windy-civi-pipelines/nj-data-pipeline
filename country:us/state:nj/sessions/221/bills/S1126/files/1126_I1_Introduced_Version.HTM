An Act creating a State bank and supplementing Title 17 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     New Jersey, like many other states, allows for the production and sale of marijuana for medicinal purposes, and may soon allow for the production and sale of marijuana for non-medicinal purposes; b.    In spite of widespread legalization on the state level, marijuana remains illegal under federal law, which limits access to financial institutions by marijuana-related businesses; c.     Many financial institutions choose not to accept deposits by, or lend funds to, marijuana-related businesses, because accepting money from a marijuana-related business presents an extreme risk due to federal law; d.    Without free access to financial institutions, marijuana-related businesses often accumulate large amounts of cash, which can endanger public safety by encouraging criminal activity, such as armed robbery, money laundering, and tax evasion; e.     This accumulation of cash is also inefficient, because it needs to be transported and counted, and cannot be used for other purposes; and f.     The establishment of a State Bank will help alleviate these problems by providing marijuana-related businesses with a place to deposit cash, as well as by providing those businesses with access to capital. 2.    As used in this act: "Board" means the board of directors of the State Bank of New Jersey.

"President" means the President of the State Bank of New Jersey. "State Bank of New Jersey," State bank or bank refers to the State-owned financial institution established pursuant to section 3 of this act.
