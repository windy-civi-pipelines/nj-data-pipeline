of the Revised Statutes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     New Jersey, like many
other states, allows for the production and sale of marijuana for medicinal
purposes, and may soon allow for the production and sale of marijuana for
non-medicinal purposes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In spite of widespread
legalization on the state level, marijuana remains illegal under federal law,
which limits access to financial institutions by marijuana-related businesses;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Many financial
institutions choose not to accept deposits by, or lend funds to,
marijuana-related businesses, because accepting money from a marijuana-related
business presents an extreme risk due to federal law;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Without free access to
financial institutions, marijuana-related businesses often accumulate large
amounts of cash, which can endanger public safety by encouraging criminal
activity, such as armed robbery, money laundering, and tax evasion;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     This accumulation of
cash is also inefficient, because it needs to be transported and counted, and
cannot be used for other purposes; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The establishment of a
State Bank will help alleviate these problems by providing marijuana-related
businesses with a place to deposit cash, as well as by providing those
businesses with access to capital.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Board&quot; means the board
of directors of the State Bank of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Commissioner&quot; means
the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Department&quot; means
the Department of Banking and Insurance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Marijuana-related business
means a manufacturer, producer, or any person that: (1) participates in any
business or organized activity that involves handling marijuana or marijuana
products, including cultivating, producing, manufacturing, selling,
transporting, displaying, dispensing, distributing, or purchasing marijuana or
marijuana products; and (2) engages in that activity pursuant to a law
established by the State of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;President&quot; means
the President of the State Bank of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;State Bank of New
Jersey,&quot; State bank or bank refers to the State-owned financial
institution established pursuant to section 3 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;State Treasurer&quot; means
the Treasurer of the State of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    There is established the
State Bank of New Jersey for the purpose of providing financial services to
marijuana-related businesses in the State of New Jersey that engage in
marijuana-related activities in accordance with State law.  Notwithstanding any
other law to the contrary, as soon as practicable, the State Bank shall provide
financial services to marijuana-related businesses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.  The State bank may
make loans to, and accept deposits from, any marijuana-related business subject
to the limitations in this act and any rules adopted by the State Treasurer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The bank shall be
permitted to charge the same rate of interest and provide for the same terms
for a loan or extension of credit as a State-chartered bank, consistent with
The State Bank Parity Act,&quot; P.L.1981, c.4 (C.17:13B-1 et seq.), and to
exercise any other power or authority permissible to a State-chartered bank. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    a.  The State bank shall
be governed by a board of directors consisting of 13 members as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the State Treasurer, or the
State Treasurers designee, as an ex officio member; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   twelve public members,
who are residents of this State, six of whom are to be appointed by the
Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate, including:  one person who
shall have experience in bank administration; one person who shall have
experience in credit union administration; one person who shall have experience
in consumer financial advocacy; one person who shall have experience in public
administration; and two additional public members. Of the six other persons,
two shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the President of the Senate,
two shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the Speaker of the General
Assembly, one shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the Minority Leader
of the Senate, and one shall be appointed upon the recommendation of the
Minority Leader of the General Assembly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each public member of the
board shall have demonstrated expertise in at least one of the following areas
and be appointed in such a manner as to ensure that the public membership of
the board includes individuals who have demonstrated expertise in the following
areas:</p>
