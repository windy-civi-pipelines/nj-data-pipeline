Historic preservation commissions established by law play a vital role in preserving the unique character of New Jerseys small towns and municipalities.  New Jersey has over 300 years of history and the loss of the tangible remains of the past would diminish New Jerseys quality of life.  This bill provides the tools to those who oversee the preservation of our built environment so that the vestiges of New Jerseys past will be carefully and thoughtfully woven into the future.
