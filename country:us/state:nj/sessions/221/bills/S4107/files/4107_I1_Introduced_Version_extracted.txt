(1) No person shall influence, or attempt to influence, by use of his official authority, the decision of the Casino Control Commission or the investigation of the Division of Gaming Enforcement in any application for casino licensure or in any proceeding to enforce the provisions of this act or the regulations of the commission. Any such attempt shall be promptly reported to the Attorney General; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be deemed to proscribe a request for information by any person concerning the status of any application for licensure or any proceeding to enforce the provisions of this act or the regulations of the commission. (2)   No person shall influence, or attempt to influence, by use of the person's official authority, the decision of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission in any application for a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant permit, or a cannabis cultivator, cannabis manufacturer, cannabis wholesaler, cannabis distributor, cannabis retailer, or cannabis delivery service license, or in any proceeding to enforce the provisions of P.L.1981, c.142 (C.52:13D-17.2 et al.), P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.), P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), or the regulations of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission.  Any such attempt shall be promptly reported to the Attorney General; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be deemed to proscribe a request for information by any person concerning the status of any permit or license application, or any proceeding to enforce the provisions of P.L.1981, c.142 (C.52:13D-17.2 et al.), P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.), P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), or the regulations of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. h.    Any person who willfully violates the provisions of this section is a disorderly person and shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000, or imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both. In addition, for violations of subsection c. of this section occurring after the effective date of P.L.2005, c.382, a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $10,000 shall be imposed upon a former State officer or employee or former special State officer or employee of a State agency in the Executive Branch upon a finding of a violation by the State Ethics Commission, which penalty may be collected in a summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2023, c.291, s.1) 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall be retroactive to the effective date of P.L.2021, c.16. STATEMENT This bill would permit the spouse of any State officer or employee who does not have responsibilities for matters affecting or regulating medical cannabis, personal use cannabis activities, or casinos to hold interest in those, directly or indirectly. Under current law, the New Jersey Conflict of Interest Law does not apply to the spouse of a State officer or employee who does not have responsibilities for matters affecting the cannabis market or casinos, and who becomes the spouse subsequent to the State officers or employees appointment or employment as a State Office or employee.  The bill removes the requirement that the individual become spouses after the State officer or employee appointment or employment and clarifies that the State officer or employee spouse does not have responsibilities for matters regulating the cannabis markets or casinos. The bill would be retroactive to the effective date of the Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act, P.L.2021, c.16.

(b)   an employee who is terminated as a result of a reduction in the workforce at the agency where employed, other than an employee who held a policy-making management position at any time during the five years prior to termination of employment, may, at any time prior to the end of the two-year period, accept employment with the holder of, or applicant for, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant permit or any entity that employs any certified medical cannabis handler to perform transfers or deliveries of medical cannabis, or a cannabis cultivator, cannabis manufacturer, cannabis wholesaler, cannabis distributor, cannabis retailer, or cannabis delivery service license or any entity that employs or uses a certified personal use cannabis handler to perform work for or on behalf of a licensed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service if, in the judgment of the State Ethics Commission, the Joint Legislative Committee on Ethical Standards, or the Supreme Court, as appropriate, such employment will not create a conflict of interest, or reasonable risk of the public perception of a conflict of interest, on the part of the employee.  In no case shall the restrictions of this subsection apply to a secretarial or clerical employee.  Nothing herein contained shall alter or amend the post-service or post-employment restrictions applicable to members and employees of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection c. of section 34 and section 35 of P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-27 and C.24:6I-28);

(1) No person shall solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any complimentary service or discount from any casino applicant or licensee which he knows or has reason to know is other than a service or discount that is offered to members of the general public in like circumstance. (2)   No person shall solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any complimentary service or discount from any holder of, or applicant for, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant permit issued pursuant to P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.) or any entity that employs any certified medical cannabis handler to perform transfers or deliveries of medical cannabis, or a cannabis cultivator, cannabis manufacturer, cannabis wholesaler, cannabis distributor, cannabis retailer, or cannabis delivery service license issued pursuant to P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.) or any entity that employs or uses a certified personal use cannabis handler to perform work for or on behalf of a licensed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service which the person knows or has reason to know is other than a service or discount that is offered to members of the general public in like circumstance. g. (1) No person shall influence, or attempt to influence, by use of his official authority, the decision of the Casino Control Commission or the investigation of the Division of Gaming Enforcement in any application for casino licensure or in any proceeding to enforce the provisions of this act or the regulations of the commission. Any such attempt shall be promptly reported to the Attorney General; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be deemed to proscribe a request for information by any person concerning the status of any application for licensure or any proceeding to enforce the provisions of this act or the regulations of the commission. (2)   No person shall influence, or attempt to influence, by use of the person's official authority, the decision of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission in any application for a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant permit, or a cannabis cultivator, cannabis manufacturer, cannabis wholesaler, cannabis distributor, cannabis retailer, or cannabis delivery service license, or in any proceeding to enforce the provisions of P.L.1981, c.142 (C.52:13D-17.2 et al.), P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.), P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), or the regulations of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission.  Any such attempt shall be promptly reported to the Attorney General; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be deemed to proscribe a request for information by any person concerning the status of any permit or license application, or any proceeding to enforce the provisions of P.L.1981, c.142 (C.52:13D-17.2 et al.), P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.), P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), or the regulations of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. h.    Any person who willfully violates the provisions of this section is a disorderly person and shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000, or imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both. In addition, for violations of subsection c. of this section occurring after the effective date of P.L.2005, c.382, a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $10,000 shall be imposed upon a former State officer or employee or former special State officer or employee of a State agency in the Executive Branch upon a finding of a violation by the State Ethics Commission, which penalty may be collected in a summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2023, c.291, s.1) 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall be retroactive to the effective date of P.L.2021, c.16. STATEMENT This bill would permit the spouse of any State officer or employee who does not have responsibilities for matters affecting or regulating medical cannabis, personal use cannabis activities, or casinos to hold interest in those, directly or indirectly. Under current law, the New Jersey Conflict of Interest Law does not apply to the spouse of a State officer or employee who does not have responsibilities for matters affecting the cannabis market or casinos, and who becomes the spouse subsequent to the State officers or employees appointment or employment as a State Office or employee.  The bill removes the requirement that the individual become spouses after the State officer or employee appointment or employment and clarifies that the State officer or employee spouse does not have responsibilities for matters regulating the cannabis markets or casinos. The bill would be retroactive to the effective date of the Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act, P.L.2021, c.16.
