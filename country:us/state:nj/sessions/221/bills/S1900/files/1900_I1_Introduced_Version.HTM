[g.  The defendant has been convicted of a crime under N.J.S.2C:14-2 or N.J.S.2C:14-3 involving violence or the threat of violence and the victim of the crime was 16 years of age or less. For purposes of this subsection, a crime involves violence or the threat of violence if the victim sustains serious bodily injury as defined in subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:11-1, or the actor is armed with and uses a deadly weapon or threatens by word or gesture to use a deadly weapon as defined in subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:11-1, or threatens to inflict serious bodily injury.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.   , c.  (C.  ) (now pending before the Legislature as this bill.) h.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.341). (cf: P.L.2007, c.341, s.8) 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT In 1987, Lawrence Singleton's parole from a California prison made national headlines; he had served eight years of a fourteen-year sentence for the vicious rape and mutilation of a 15-year-old hitchhiker.  After the rape, Singleton had hacked off his victim's arms with an ax and left her to die, but she survived to testify against him. Despite the public outcry against Singleton's release, officials were powerless to stop it, since he had served his sentence under the California law in effect at the time.  In February, 1997, Singleton was arrested again, this time for the murder of a woman in his home. This bill is intended to prevent brutal attackers such as Singleton from ever getting a second chance to claim another victim. The bill would require that any person who commits a violent sexual assault would be required to serve a life sentence, without possibility for parole.  The life sentence would be imposed on any person convicted of aggravated sexual assault upon a victim who suffers serious bodily injury. Under the Criminal Code, "serious bodily injury" is defined as "bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ."
