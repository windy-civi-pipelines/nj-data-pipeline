class=HangingAnActChar> establishing the New Jersey Animal Abuser Registry,
supplementing Title 4 of the Revised Statutes, and amending R.S.4:22-55.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  This act
shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;New Jersey Animal Abuser Registry
Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  a.  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Reputable studies in the
fields of psychology, sociology, and criminology have consistently demonstrated
that violent offenders often have childhood or adolescent histories involving
serious, intentional acts of animal cruelty, and one study indicates that
animal abuse may be characteristic of the developmental histories of up to 66
percent of violent offenders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The Federal Bureau of
Investigation has recognized the link between animal abuse and later acts of
violence since the 1970s, when its analysis of serial killers revealed that
most had killed or tortured animals during their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   More recent studies have
revealed consistent patterns of animal cruelty and abuse in the criminal
histories of perpetrators of other forms of violence, including child abuse,
spousal abuse, and elder abuse, and a groundbreaking study conducted in 1983 of
53 New Jersey families being treated for child abuse found that, in 88 percent
of these families, animal abuse was also present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Studies in this area
have additionally found a common history of documented animal abuse among
sexually violent offenders, with one study showing that nearly one-half of
rapists and almost one-third of pedophiles had also engaged in acts of cruelty
towards animals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   As reported by the
Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, persons who participate in animal fighting - a lucrative
business endeavor that centers around the ongoing and sadistic abuse, torture,
and killing of innocent animals for profit - are also often participants in
other crimes that are associated with violence, including drug and gun crimes,
gambling offenses, and homicide offenses, and many such offenders will continue
to participate in animal fighting endeavors and violence-related offenses even
after raids, arrests, and jail time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The American Psychiatric
Association has listed animal abuse in its diagnostic manual of major
psychiatric disorders, as a symptom of Conduct Disorder, which is a disorder
that is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>characterized by a general and
ongoing disregard for societal rules and the feelings of others. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Because evidence shows
that persons who commit animal abuse offenses are likely to engage in
recidivist acts of violence against either or both animals or humans, such
persons pose a clear and significant threat to public safety, and, as a result,
have a reduced expectation of privacy upon being convicted of or found civilly
liable for these offenses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   Knowledge of an animal
abuse offenders presence in the community could be a significant factor in
protecting oneself, one's family members, and one's companion animals or
livestock, from recidivist acts of the offender, and the technology afforded by
the Internet would make this information readily accessible to private persons
and entities, and enable them to undertake appropriate remedial precautions to
prevent or avoid placing potential victims at risk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   A system requiring the
registration of animal abuse offenders, which utilizes complete and accurate data,
will provide law enforcement with additional information that may be critical
to preventing and appropriately responding to incidents of violence in the
community, and will allow law enforcement officials to alert the public as to
the presence of these violent offenders within the community, when necessary to
promote the public safety. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  The registration of
animal abuse offenders and the public disclosure of information pertaining to
these offenders is a necessary and appropriate means of assuring the protection
of the public and at-risk animals, and such registration and disclosure of
information is not intended to punish or additionally sanction the offender's
behavior, or to allow or encourage members of the public to seek retribution
against the offender, or to be used for any purposes other than the protection
of the public and at-risk animals, and should not be construed to be punitive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Legislature
therefore determines that, in order to further the Legislature's primary
interest of protecting vulnerable populations from potential harm, it is both
necessary and proper to provide for the establishment and implementation of an
animal abuser registry system that will require the continuing registration of
animal abuse offenders, and allow for the public disclosure of certain
information pertaining to these offenders in order to promote the public
safety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  For the
purposes of this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Animal abuse

therein.  The procedures related to risk assessment shall provide (1) a method
by which an offender will receive notice of the results of the risk assessment,
and (2) a means by which an offender can obtain review of the risk assessment
determination prior to the public release of any identifying information.  The
procedures related to community notification shall be reasonably calculated to
allow the dissemination of relevant information to members of the public who
have a particular need for it, while avoiding disclosure to those who have no
similar need.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would provide for
the establishment and implementation of an animal abuser registry system that
would require the continuing registration of animal abuse offenders and allow
for the public disclosure of certain information pertaining to those offenders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Such a registry system for
animal abusers is necessary because the overwhelming evidence accumulated since
1970 shows that persons who cruelly abuse or torture animals are likely to
engage in recidivist acts of violence against both animals and humans.  In
particular, studies have shown that early incidents of animal abuse are often
part of the criminal histories of serial killers, child, spouse, and elder
abusers, and sexually violent predators, and may be characteristic of the
developmental histories of up to 66 percent of violent offenders, in general. 
In addition, it has been shown that those who abuse animals through
participation in animal fighting rings also often engage in other crimes
associated with violence, and will often continue to engage in animal abuse and
other violence-related offenses even after serving jail time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require registration
for any person convicted of an enumerated animal abuse offense who maintains,
establishes, or re-establishes a primary residence or secondary residence in
this State or who is otherwise physically present in the State for more than 14
consecutive days or a period exceeding 30 days in a calendar year.  In
particular, a person would be required to register if they have been convicted,
adjudicated delinquent, found not guilty by reason of insanity, or found
civilly liable for any of the following animal abuse offenses:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   overdriving,
overloading, driving when overloaded, overworking, depriving of necessary
sustenance, abusing, or needlessly killing a living animal by direct or
indirect means, including through the use of another living animal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   tormenting, torturing,
maiming, hanging, poisoning, unnecessarily or cruelly beating, or needlessly
mutilating a living animal by direct or indirect means, including through the
use of another living animal, whether or not such actions cause the death of
the animal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   cruelly killing, by
direct or indirect means, a living animal, including through the use of another
living animal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   causing, allowing, or
permitting the fighting or baiting of a living animal for amusement or gain;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   engaging in the
management of, or receiving money or other consideration for the admission of a
person to, a place that is kept or used for the purposes of fighting or baiting
a living animal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   owning, possessing,
keeping, training, promoting, purchasing, or knowingly selling a living animal
for the purposes of fighting or baiting that animal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   allowing or suffering a
place under a persons ownership or control to be used for the purposes of
fighting or baiting a living animal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   acting as a spectator,
gambling on the outcome of a fight, or otherwise encouraging or assisting in
activities occurring at a place that is kept or used for the purposes of
fighting or baiting a living animal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   carrying a living animal
in or upon a vehicle or otherwise, in a cruel or inhumane manner;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  impounding or confining
a living animal and failing to supply it during such confinement with a
sufficient quantity of good and wholesome food and water;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11)  abandoning a maimed,
sick, infirm, or disabled animal to die in a public place;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (12)  abandoning a domestic
animal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (13)  unlawfully debarking or
silencing a dog;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (14)  using a live pigeon,
fowl, or other bird as a target or to be shot at for amusement or as a test of
skill in marksmanship, or shooting such a bird, except where such use or
shooting conforms with the rules pertaining to the shooting of game animals;
and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (15)  any comparable offense
in another state, country, or jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require that
notice of the duty to register be provided by the Attorney General within 30
days after the bills enactment, and by the Motor Vehicle Commission upon
application for a drivers license or identification card.  The court or local
law enforcement agency with which an offender is required to initially register
pursuant to this bill would be required to notify the offender of the specific
requirements of the bill, and the penalties for noncompliance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The information to be included
in an offenders registration would consist of the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A statement in writing,
signed by the animal abuse offender, acknowledging that the offender has been
advised of the duty to register, and including the offenders name, social
security number, age, race, sex, date of birth, height, weight, hair and eye
color; address of primary residence and secondary residence if any, or county
and municipality of physical presence if a non-resident or homeless resident;
address of anticipated or current places of employment; any anticipated or
current school enrollment; the commission date and a brief description of the
conviction offenses for which registration is required; and the indictment
number associated with each such offense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A photograph of the
defendant; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Any other information
that the Attorney General deems necessary to properly inform the public about
the identity of the offender and to assess the risk of re-offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require each
offender to verify the address on the registration statement on an annual
basis, and would additionally require each offender to notify law enforcement
officials of any change in address.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any person who fails to
register as required by the bills provisions would be guilty of a crime of the
third degree and would be subject, in addition to any other penalties provided
by law, to pay a fine of $2,500.  Any registered animal abuse offender who
fails to comply, or who falsifies information in complying with the change of
address requirements or address verification requirements provided by the bill,
would be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree, and would be subject, in
addition to any other penalties provided by law, to pay a fine of $1,500. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Attorney General would be
required to maintain a central registry of all registrations submitted in
accordance with this bills provisions, and would additionally be required to
develop a system for making certain offender information from the central
registry available to the public on the Internet.  The Attorney General would
be responsible both for ensuring that the Internet registry contains
appropriate warnings and notifications, and for maintaining the accuracy of,
and for timely updating the information contained therein.  An Animal Abuse
Offender Internet Registry Advisory Council would be established to consult with
and make recommendations to the Attorney General concerning the publication of
registration records on the Internet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All records maintained
pursuant to the bill would be open to any law enforcement agency in the State,
any other state, or the United States government, and would be able to be
released to the Office of Animal Welfare in the Department of Health and Senior
Services, or to the Division of Child Behavioral Health Services, the Division
of Prevention and Community Partnerships, or the Division of Youth and Family
Services in the Department of Children and Families for use in carrying out the
offices and the divisions respective responsibilities under law.  Any
official would be immune from civil liability for damages for any discretionary
decision to release relevant records unless it is shown that the official acted
with gross negligence or in bad faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon receipt of an offenders
registration or notification of an offenders change in address, and pursuant
to the procedures outlined in the bills provisions, the chief law enforcement
officer of the municipality (or county) wherein the offenders primary residence
and secondary residence, if any, is located, or wherein the offender is
generally present if a non-resident or a homeless resident of the State, would
be required to provide notification to the community of the offenders presence
therein, in accordance with guidelines to be established by the Attorney
General relating to the offenders risk of re-offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would establish a
temporary advisory council to assist the Attorney General in establishing these
guidelines and procedures for risk assessment and community notification.  The
bill would require the Attorney General to consider various factors relevant to
an offenders risk of re-offense, and would require the regulations adopted by
the Attorney General to provide for two tiers of community notification based
on whether the offender is determined to have a low risk of re-offense, or
whether the offender is determined to have a moderate or high risk of
re-offense.             The bill would require the regulations adopted by the
Attorney General to prohibit a low risk categorization in a case where the
registered animal abuse offender (1) has more than one prior conviction for an
animal abuse offense, as defined by the bill, (2) has one prior conviction for
an animal abuse offense in addition to one or more convictions for a violent
offense against a person, or (3) has been diagnosed with Conduct Disorder  a
disorder characterized by a general and ongoing disregard for societal laws and
the feelings of others, and for which animal abuse is a symptom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case that an offender
is determined to have a low risk of re-offense, notification of the offenders
presence in the community would be provided only to law enforcement agencies
likely to encounter the person, and the persons registration information would
be prohibited from publication on the Internet unless such publication is
ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.  In the case that an offender is
determined to have a moderate or high risk of re-offense, notification of the
offenders presence in the community would be provided to law enforcement
agencies likely to encounter the offender, as well as to members of the public
likely to encounter the offender, and to animal shelters, pet adoption
societies, humane societies, veterinarians offices, and other animal welfare
or control groups in the offenders community.  Furthermore, registration
information for offenders having a moderate to high risk of re-offense would be
made available for public viewing, without limitation, on the Internet
registry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the
Attorney Generals regulations to ensure that an offender will be provided with
notice of the results of the risk assessment and will be afforded an
opportunity to have that determination reviewed prior to Internet publication
or any notification of community members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would allow the
disclosure of the offenders exact address only in very limited circumstances,
since the courts have held that an offender may have some limited privacy
interest in that information.  Accordingly, the offenders exact address would
be excluded from the Internet registry, and would be disclosed only to
individuals within the offenders community who have a particular need for that
information.  Moreover, the offenders exact address would be disclosed to
individuals in the community only in cases where the individuals have signed a
receipt of notice form, which explicitly prohibits the disclosure of the
offenders exact address to persons outside the individuals household, and which
provides express notice that any harassment of the offender is punishable by
law.  Businesses within the offenders community would be entitled to know only
the vicinity of the offenders address.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any information disclosed
pursuant to the bills provisions could be used by any person in any manner to
protect an animal at risk, or for any other lawful purpose consistent with the
enhancement of public safety.  Except in the case of willful or wanton
misconduct, any person who provides or fails to provide information to the
community, or who discloses or fails to disclose information on the Internet
registry in accordance with the bills provisions, would be immune from civil
or criminal action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would provide,
however, that any person using the information disclosed pursuant thereto to
commit a crime would be guilty of a crime of the third degree, and that any
person using the information disclosed to commit a disorderly persons or petty
disorderly persons offense would be guilty of a disorderly persons offense and
subject to pay a fine of $500 to $1,000, in addition to any other penalty
imposed.  Evidence that a person obtained information about an offender from
law enforcement or from the Internet registry within one year prior to
committing a criminal offense against that offender would give rise to an
inference that the person used information in violation of the bills
provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also provide
that any person who uses any information disclosed pursuant to the bills
provisions to encourage, solicit, or assist a registered animal abuse offender
or other person to engage in criminal activity or an animal abuse offense would
be guilty of a crime of the third degree and, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, subject to pay a fine of $2,500.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would additionally
prevent the use of information disclosed pursuant thereto for purposes of
health or other insurance; loans; credit; education, scholarships, or
fellowships; benefits, privileges, or services provided by a business
establishment, unless consistent with enhancement of the public safety; or
housing and accommodations.  However, the bill would specifically allow a
humane society, animal welfare organization, or other similar group to use the
information disclosed pursuant to its provisions in order to screen applicants
for employment or for pet adoption services.  The use of any information
disclosed pursuant to the bills provisions for any of the specifically
prohibited purposes would make the user of the information liable for actual
damages, attorneys fees, and any amount that may be determined by a jury or a
court sitting without a jury, which is not less than $250, and not more than
three times the amount of actual damage, or for a civil penalty of not more
than $25,000.  Furthermore, the bill would authorize civil action for
injunctive or other preventative relief in the case that there is reasonable
cause to believe that any person or group is engaged in a pattern of misuse of
information disclosed pursuant to the bills provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would establish the
Animal Abuser Registry Fund, separate and distinct from the General Fund, in
order to provide a dedicated source of moneys by which to finance the ongoing
administrative and maintenance costs associated with the Animal Abuser Registry
and the expenses associated with the community notifications required under the
bill.  The fund would be credited with:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   fifty percent of all
civil and criminal fines collected by a court in relation to the animal abuse
offenses for which registration is required;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   any excess fines
collected by a court as a result of an offenders failure to register, failure
to notify authorities of a change in address, failure to timely verify the
offenders address, or falsification of any information in the course of
complying with the bills requirements in this regard;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   any excess fines
collected by a court from the unlawful use of information disclosed pursuant to
the acts provisions to encourage, solicit, or assist a registered animal abuse
offender or other person to engage in criminal activity or commit an animal
abuse offense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   any interest or other
investment income accrued on moneys deposited in the account; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   any moneys gifted to the
fund; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   any other moneys
appropriated by the Legislature and allocated to the fund for its purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would
provide that a registered animal abuse offender may make application to the
Superior Court to terminate the obligation to register under this bill upon
proof that the person has not committed an animal abuse offense or an offense
constituting violence against humans within 15 years following conviction or
release from a correctional facility for any term of imprisonment imposed,
whichever is later, and is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of
others.  A registered animal abuse offender would also be able to make
application to the Attorney General to terminate the obligation to register
under this bill upon the submission of evidence, sufficient in the
determination of the Attorney General, to establish that the offender no longer
maintains primary residence or secondary residence in this State, and will not
be present in the State for more than 14 consecutive days, or for an aggregate period
of 30 days or more.  However, such an offender would be required to re-register
with the State in the event that he re-establishes primary residence or
secondary residence in the State or re-establishes physical presence therein
for the requisite period of time.</p>
