section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), for legislative approval of any
reimbursement rate increases as may be needed to comply with minimum wage
requirements for long-term care facility direct care staff as provided in
subsection i. of section 5 of P.L.1966, c.113 (C.34:11-56a4).  The commissioner
may recommend that increases for nursing homes be tied to improvements in
specific quality and safety metrics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    No later than 90 days
after the effective date of this act, the Commissioner of Human Services shall
conduct a review of the Department of Human Services' Medicaid value-based
payment strategy, including the Quality Incentive Payment Program, to ensure
incentives provided under the strategy focus on priority metrics for quality
improvement, and shall review and determine whether incentives are an effective
means of driving improvements in quality of care and resident and staff safety
in nursing homes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    (1)  The Commissioner of
Human Services shall establish a direct care ratio reporting and rebate
requirement, which shall take effect no later than July 1, 2021, pursuant to which
nursing homes shall be required to report total revenues collected, along with
the portion of revenues that are expended on direct care staff wages, other
staff wages, taxes, administrative costs, investments in improvements to the
facility's equipment and physical plant, profits, and any other factors as the
commissioner shall require.  <u>At the commissioners discretion, the reporting
requirements of this paragraph may be met by the nursing home submitting an
audited consolidated financial statement that meets the requirements of
subsection k. of section 2 of P.L.1977, c.237 (C.26:2H-33).</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The direct care ratio
shall require 90 percent, or such higher percentage as the commissioner may
establish by regulation, of a facility's aggregate revenue in a fiscal year to
be expended on the direct care of residents.  The commissioner shall determine
which components of the reporting requirements shall be attributed to direct
patient care, administrative costs, and profits.  The commissioner may adjust
the components of the ratio as appropriate based on current financial
information reported by nursing homes and overall performance by the nursing
home related to patient safety and quality of care. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  The commissioner or an
entity designated by the commissioner may conduct an audit of the financial
information reported by nursing homes pursuant to this section to ensure the
accuracy of the information reported and compliance with the requirements of
this section, as well as to identify and recover any payments that exceed the
allowed cost ratio for administrative costs and profits.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  In each case where the
direct care loss ratio fails to substantially comply with the ratio requirement
established pursuant to this subsection, the nursing home shall issue a pro
rata dividend or credit to the State and to all individuals and entities making
payments to the nursing home for resident services in an amount sufficient to
assure that the aggregate amount paid for direct care staff wages, other staff
wages, taxes, administrative costs, investments in improvements to the nursing
home's equipment and physical plant, profits, and other factors, plus the
amount of the dividends and credits, equals the mandatory ratio for the
previous calendar year.  The pro rata dividend or credit shall be equal to the
percentage of payments made by the payor to the nursing home in the previous
calendar year out of all payments made to the nursing home for services
provided in the previous calendar year from all payment sources.  All dividends
and credits shall be distributed by June 30 of the year following the calendar
year in which the ratio requirements were not satisfied.</p>

consolidated financial statements for all prospective new owners and operators
