The Legislature urges institutions of higher education to expand efforts that have been shown to improve student success, including retention, graduation, and completion rates, by fostering inclusive campus environments and providing academic, social, and career support services tailored to diverse student populations. 5. The Legislature further urges private businesses operating in New Jersey to prioritize DEIA efforts in hiring, training, leadership development, and workplace culture to enhance innovation, economic growth, and competitiveness. 6. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the Secretary of Higher Education, the governing boards of each institution of higher education in the State, and the President of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. STATEMENT This resolution supports Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) initiatives in higher education and private businesses. The State of New Jersey is one of the most diverse states in the nation, with more than 45 percent of its population composed of people of color, and is home to some of the most culturally diverse cities in the United States. Further, New Jersey has one of the largest immigrant populations in the country, with over two million foreign-born residents representing more than 100 different nationalities, and where nearly one-third of the States population speaks a language other than English at home. New Jerseys institutions of higher education reflect this diversity, with Rutgers University consistently ranking among the most diverse public institutions of higher education in the country, and many of the States two- and four-year institutions serving high percentages of first-generation college students, as well as students from historically marginalized communities. DEIA programs in higher education have been shown to increase student success, including higher retention, graduation, and completion rates, by providing mentorship, financial assistance, culturally inclusive curricula, and campus resources that foster belonging and academic achievement. Additionally, New Jerseys workforce is strengthened by its diversity, with industries such as healthcare, technology, pharmaceuticals, finance, and logistics benefiting from a multilingual and multicultural talent pool that enhances innovation and economic competitiveness. Businesses in New Jersey that implement strong DEIA policies experience greater employee engagement, stronger financial performance, and increased innovation, reinforcing the States position as an economic leader in an increasingly globalized market. New Jersey has a long history of advancing civil rights and social justice, as reflected in its strong anti-discrimination laws, LGBTQ+ protections, and efforts to promote economic and educational equity for all residents. The New Jersey Legislature recognizes the importance of continuing to support DEIA initiatives in both higher education and private industry to ensure that the State remains a model of inclusion, equity, and opportunity.
