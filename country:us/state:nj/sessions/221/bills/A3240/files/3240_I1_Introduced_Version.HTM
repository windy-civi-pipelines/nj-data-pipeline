The bill establishes a disorderly persons offense when a minor gains access to a cannabis item at a premises under the persons control if the person knows or reasonable should know that a minor is likely to gain access.  A minor is defined as a person under the age of 16.  The penalties established under this bill parallel those established for providing alcohol to minors. The bill also codifies certain parts of the New Jersey Administrative Code promulgated by the Cannabis Regulatory Commission (commission), specifically concerning packaging and warning labels.  The bill prohibits cannabis items from having packaging that may be attractive to children.  The bill also requires the cannabis products and items to contain consumer warnings, including the the nationwide toll-free telephone number for poison control. Finally, the bill requires the commission to collect data and information on adverse events when a minor consumes cannabis and to report it to the Governor and Legislature.

STATEMENT This bill creates a new offense for when a minor gains access to an improperly stored cannabis product and establishes packaging requirements for cannabis items. The bill establishes a disorderly persons offense when a minor gains access to a cannabis item at a premises under the persons control if the person knows or reasonable should know that a minor is likely to gain access.  A minor is defined as a person under the age of 16.  The penalties established under this bill parallel those established for providing alcohol to minors. The bill also codifies certain parts of the New Jersey Administrative Code promulgated by the Cannabis Regulatory Commission (commission), specifically concerning packaging and warning labels.  The bill prohibits cannabis items from having packaging that may be attractive to children.  The bill also requires the cannabis products and items to contain consumer warnings, including the the nationwide toll-free telephone number for poison control. Finally, the bill requires the commission to collect data and information on adverse events when a minor consumes cannabis and to report it to the Governor and Legislature.
