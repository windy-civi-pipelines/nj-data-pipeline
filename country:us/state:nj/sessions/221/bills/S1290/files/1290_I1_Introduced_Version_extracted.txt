CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning new motor vehicles and supplementing P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Amplitude modulation radio, commonly referred to as AM radio, has been a feature in motor vehicle radios since the 1950s. b.    AM radio plays a critical role in informing the public about natural disasters and other crises. c.     AM radio is capable of being transmitted over long distances, making it essential for communication during a catastrophe. d.    According to some estimates, approximately 47 million Americans listen to AM radio to receive real-time federal and state information concerning public safety incidents. e.     Owing to backup communications equipment and generators, AM radio is often available when other communication methods fail. f.     However, motor vehicle manufacturers, particularly manufacturers of electric vehicles, are increasingly choosing to discontinue support for AM radio in new motor vehicles, prompting concern among emergency response professionals. g.    The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agencys emergency-warning system asserts that eliminating AM radios from motor vehicles could impact the ability of people to receive vital public-safety information while traveling in motor vehicles. h.    Accordingly, the Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to take action to ensure that this essential communication method remains present and functional in new motor vehicles. 2.    a.  As used in this act: AM radio means an amplitude modulation radio capable of receiving amplitude modulation frequency transmissions. Motor vehicle means the same as that term is defined in R.S.39:1-1. New motor vehicle means a motor vehicle that has not been previously sold to a person other than a distributor, wholesaler, or dealer of motor vehicles for resale. b.    It shall be an unlawful practice and violation of P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.) for a person to sell or lease a new motor vehicle in this State unless the motor vehicle is equipped with a radio capable of receiving AM radio broadcasts. c.     The Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety may promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), necessary to effectuate the purposes of P.L.      , c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 3.    This act shall take effect one year following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires new motor vehicles sold or leased in this State to be equipped with a radio capable of receiving AM radio broadcasts. Amplitude modulation radio, commonly referred to as AM radio, has been a feature in motor vehicle radios since the 1950s.  AM radio plays a critical role in informing the public about natural disasters and other crises.  AM radio is capable of being transmitted over long distances, making it essential for communication during a catastrophe.  According to some estimates, approximately 47 million Americans listen to AM radio to receive real-time federal and state information concerning public safety incidents.  Owing to backup communications equipment and generators, AM radio is often available when other communication methods fail.

A violation of the provisions of the bill would be considered an unlawful practice under the consumer fraud act, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.).  An unlawful practice is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense.  In addition, a violation can result in a cease and desist order issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured.
