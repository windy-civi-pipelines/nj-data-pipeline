Studies which demonstrate the disparity between the availability and utilization of minority-owned and women-owned businesses in the State procurement process can help provide the basis for goal-based procurement programs to alleviate historic discrimination against minority-owned and women-owned business enterprises. Every four years following the issuance of the first report the Chief Diversity Officer must submit an additional report to the Legislature on whether a study concerning the utilization of minority-owned and women-owned businesses in the procurement of goods and services for State agencies is needed.  The officer may request an appropriation of funding for the study.
