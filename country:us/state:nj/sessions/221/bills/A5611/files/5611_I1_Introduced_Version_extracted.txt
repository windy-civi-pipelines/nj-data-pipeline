STATEMENT This bill updates current law on ticket sales and resales by establishing comprehensive consumer protections in the live event ticketing marketplace. It is designed to address longstanding concerns about lack of transparency, price inflation, and limited transferability of tickets. The bill ensures that consumers have the ability to freely use, give away, or resell tickets without being subjected to unfair restrictions or deceptive practices by the ticket issuers or platforms. The bill requires the disclosure of the full ticket price of online and electronic tickets  including all fees  from the first instance the ticket is displayed.  For physical or in-person tickets, the full price is to be clearly posted at the point of sale. The bill prohibits any increase in price during the purchase process.  It additionally restricts the imposition of delivery fees for electronic or print-at-home tickets and limits surcharges at the box office.  Consumers are to have a clear, itemized breakdown before selecting a ticket for purchase. To preserve consumer choice, the bill prohibits ticket issuers from mandating resale through a specific platform.  It also requires issuers using non-transferable ticketing systems to offer an equivalent transferable ticket option.  Consumers are not to be penalized or denied entry solely because a ticket was purchased through a legal resale channel. Additional provisions bar speculative ticket sales without disclosure, mandate full refunds for canceled events, and guarantee refund rights if resold tickets are invalid or misrepresented.  Resellers are prohibited from double-selling the same ticket or concealing ticket location details when selling multiple tickets.  The bill also makes it a fourth-degree crime to use bots or software that bypasses ticket limits, CAPTCHA protections, or waiting rooms.  It establishes escalating fines and a permanent ban from the resale market for repeat offenders. For events with over 3,500 attendees, ticket issuers are to publicly disclose the percentage of tickets allocated for presale, artist holds, sponsors, and general public sale at least seven days before tickets go on sale.  The bill amends current law to strengthen consumer protections on ticket websites focused on resales.  It requires disclosures about pricing, affiliations, and refund policies, prohibits misleading domain names, and mandates public posting of available ticket inventory. Finally, the bill empowers the Division of Consumer Affairs to enforce all provisions, investigate complaints, impose penalties of up to $50,000 per violation, order restitution, and maintain a public registry of licensed ticket brokers.

STATEMENT This bill updates current law on ticket sales and resales by establishing comprehensive consumer protections in the live event ticketing marketplace. It is designed to address longstanding concerns about lack of transparency, price inflation, and limited transferability of tickets. The bill ensures that consumers have the ability to freely use, give away, or resell tickets without being subjected to unfair restrictions or deceptive practices by the ticket issuers or platforms. The bill requires the disclosure of the full ticket price of online and electronic tickets  including all fees  from the first instance the ticket is displayed.  For physical or in-person tickets, the full price is to be clearly posted at the point of sale. The bill prohibits any increase in price during the purchase process.  It additionally restricts the imposition of delivery fees for electronic or print-at-home tickets and limits surcharges at the box office.  Consumers are to have a clear, itemized breakdown before selecting a ticket for purchase. To preserve consumer choice, the bill prohibits ticket issuers from mandating resale through a specific platform.  It also requires issuers using non-transferable ticketing systems to offer an equivalent transferable ticket option.  Consumers are not to be penalized or denied entry solely because a ticket was purchased through a legal resale channel. Additional provisions bar speculative ticket sales without disclosure, mandate full refunds for canceled events, and guarantee refund rights if resold tickets are invalid or misrepresented.  Resellers are prohibited from double-selling the same ticket or concealing ticket location details when selling multiple tickets.  The bill also makes it a fourth-degree crime to use bots or software that bypasses ticket limits, CAPTCHA protections, or waiting rooms.  It establishes escalating fines and a permanent ban from the resale market for repeat offenders. For events with over 3,500 attendees, ticket issuers are to publicly disclose the percentage of tickets allocated for presale, artist holds, sponsors, and general public sale at least seven days before tickets go on sale.  The bill amends current law to strengthen consumer protections on ticket websites focused on resales.  It requires disclosures about pricing, affiliations, and refund policies, prohibits misleading domain names, and mandates public posting of available ticket inventory. Finally, the bill empowers the Division of Consumer Affairs to enforce all provisions, investigate complaints, impose penalties of up to $50,000 per violation, order restitution, and maintain a public registry of licensed ticket brokers.
