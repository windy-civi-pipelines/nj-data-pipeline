Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.33:1-26 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     33:1-26.  All licenses shall
be for a term of one year from July 1 in each year.  The respective fees for
any such license shall be prorated according to the effective date of the
license and based on the respective annual fee as in this chapter provided. 
Where the license fee deposited with the application exceeds the prorated fee,
a refund of the excess shall be made to the licensee.  Licenses are not
transferable except as hereinafter provided.  The holders of a plenary winery
license or farm winery license who are engaged in an alternating proprietorship
pursuant to subsection 2a. or 2b. of R.S.33:1-10 shall be permitted to share a
place of business on an alternating basis for production of wine in a manner
consistent with regulations promulgated by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and
Trade Bureau.  Approval by the director to engage in an alternating
proprietorship shall be conditioned upon the ongoing approval of the Alcohol
and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the alternating proprietorship.  A separate
license is required for each specific place of business, except as otherwise
provided in this section for the holders of a plenary winery license or the
farm winery license who are engaged in an alternating proprietorship, and the
operation and effect of every license is confined to the licensed premises.  No
retail license of any class shall be issued to any holder of a manufacturer's
or wholesaler's license, and no manufacturer's or wholesaler's license shall be
issued to the holder of a retail license of any class.  Any person who shall
exercise or attempt to exercise, or hold himself out as authorized to exercise,
the rights and privileges of a licensee except the licensee and then only with
respect to the licensed premises, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In case of death, bankruptcy,
receivership or incompetency of the licensee, or if for any other reason
whatsoever the operation of the business covered by the license shall devolve
by operation of law upon a person other than the licensee, the director or the
issuing authority may, in his or its discretion, extend the license for a
limited time, not exceeding its term, to the executor, administrator, trustee,
receiver or other person upon whom the same has devolved by operation of law as
aforesaid.  Under no circumstances, however, shall a license, or rights thereunder,
be deemed property, subject to inheritance, sale, pledge, lien, levy,
attachment, execution, seizure for debts, or any other transfer or disposition
whatsoever, except for payment of taxes, fees, interest and penalties imposed
by any State tax law for which a lien may attach pursuant to R.S.54:49-1 or
pursuant to the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et seq., or any
similar State lien of tax, except to the extent expressly provided by this
chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     On application made therefor
setting forth the same matters and things with reference to the premises to
which a transfer of license is sought as are required to be set forth in
connection with an original application for license, as to the premises, and
after publication of notice of intention to apply for transfer, in the same
manner as is required in case of an application for license as to the premises,
the director or other issuing authority may transfer, upon payment of a fee of
10% of the annual license fee for the license sought to be transferred, any
license issued by him or it respectively to a different place of business than
that specified therein, by endorsing permission upon the license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     On application made therefor
setting forth the same matters and things with reference to the person to whom
a transfer of license is sought as are required to be set forth in connection
with an original application for license, which application for transfer shall
be signed and sworn to by the person to whom the transfer of license is sought
and shall bear the consent in writing of the licensee to the transfer, and
after publication of notice of intention by the person to whom the transfer of
license is sought, to apply for transfer in the same manner as is required in
the case of an original application for license, the director or other issuing
authority, as the case may be, may transfer any license issued by him or it
respectively to the applicant for transfer by endorsing the license.  The
application and the applicant shall comply with all requirements of this
chapter pertaining to an original application for license and shall be
accompanied, in lieu of the license fee required on the original application,
by a fee of 10% of the annual license fee for the license sought to be
transferred, which 10% shall be retained by the director or other issuing
authority, as the case may be, whether the transfer be granted or not, and
accounted for as other license fees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the other issuing authority
shall refuse to grant a transfer the applicant shall be notified forthwith of
the refusal by a notice served personally upon the applicant, or sent to him by
registered mail addressed to him at the address stated in the application, and
the applicant may, within 30 days after the date of service or mailing of the notice,
appeal to the director from the action of the issuing authority.  If the other
issuing authority shall grant a transfer, any taxpayer or other aggrieved
person opposing the grant of the transfer may, within 30 days after the grant
of the transfer, appeal to the director from the action of the issuing
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill addresses various
concerns associated with difficulties in obtaining and maintaining employment
following a persons release from prison.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a person whose
drivers license has been suspended for certain motor vehicle violations would
be allowed to apply for a restricted use drivers license.  This license is to
be used exclusively for driving to and from the licensees place of employment
or education, traveling to and from medical appointments, or driving the
licensees child to and from school or a child care facility while in the
course of driving to and from the licensees place of employment or education. 
The bill places restrictions on these licenses and requires certain identifying
characteristics on the licenses and any vehicle operated by a person with a
license.  This provision is intended to mitigate the adverse effects that
suspension of driving privileges has on certain persons who need to drive motor
vehicles to maintain their employment or continue their education.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill would
allow a potential employee to affirmatively demonstrate rehabilitation when
seeking employment at an airport.  It also specifies that an alcoholic beverage
licensee may only use the results of a criminal history record background check
as a factor in determining whether a person is qualified to be employed in the
establishment.  It is the sponsors intent to maintain public safety by
preserving the statutory requirement that these potential employees undergo a
criminal history background check, while allowing employers to independently
determine whether a prior conviction would have any effect on future job
performance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also would prohibit
State, county or municipal employers from requiring a person to disclose
criminal convictions on an application for employment.  The bill would prohibit
the employer from inquiring about convictions for crimes under New
  Jersey law or substantially similar offenses under federal law or the laws of
other states.  Under the bill, a person would not be exempted from undergoing a
criminal history record background check required by law.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, this bill would
prohibit all public and private employers from discriminating against
ex-convicts and provide for the Commission on Civil Rights to enforce the
provisions of this bill.  Public and private employers would be prohibited from
denying a person a license or employment because the person has previously been
convicted of a criminal offense or because the person has been determined to
lack good moral character based on a previous conviction.  The bill applies
to current, as well as prospective, employees.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Employers would not be subject
to this prohibition if:  (1) there is a direct relationship between a previous
criminal offense and the specific license or employment sought; or (2) issuing
the license or hiring the person would involve an unreasonable risk to property
or to the safety or welfare of specific persons or the general public.  Employers
are required to consider the following factors to determine if either of these
exceptions apply:  (1) that this States policy is to encourage licensing and
employing persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses; (2)
the specific duties and responsibilities related to the license or employment
sought; (3) the bearing, if any, the criminal offense will have on the persons
fitness or ability to perform the required duties or responsibilities; (4)  how
much time has elapsed since the offense was committed; (5) the persons age
when the offense was committed; (6) the seriousness of the offense; (7)
information provided by the person showing rehabilitation and good conduct; and
(8) the legitimate interest of the public agency or private employer in
