calendar day before a general election and end on the second calendar day
before that general election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The voting process during the
early voting period shall be conducted using electronic poll books and
optical-scan voting machines that read hand-marked paper ballots or other
voting machines that produce a voter-verifiable paper ballot. Any municipality conducting
regular municipal elections in May pursuant to the provisions of the
&quot;Uniform Nonpartisan Elections Law,&quot; P.L.1981, c.379 (C.40:45-5 et
seq.), may, by an ordinance adopted by its governing body, also conduct early
voting for the regular municipal election, in accordance with the provisions of
this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1 et al.). If adopted by a municipal
governing body, the early voting period for a regular municipal election in May
shall start on the 4th calendar day before the regular municipal election and
end on the second calendar day before that regular municipal election<u>,
except that the municipal governing body may adopt an ordinance to allow the
early voting period to start on the 11th calendar day before the regular
municipal election and end on the second calendar day before that regular
municipal election</u>.An early voting period shall only be permitted for a
non-presidential or presidential primary election and a general election in
this State and, if adopted by a municipal governing body, a regular municipal
election conducted in May. Pursuant to the provisions of this act and Title 19
of the Revised Statutes and in accordance with procedures that may be
established by the Secretary of State for verifying eligible voters, each county
board of elections shall verify that a registered voter is qualified to vote in
the election and shall prescribe the manner by which a registered voter may
vote during such period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  (1)  For the primary and
the general election, each county board of elections shall designate at least
three, but not more than five, public locations within each county as the sites
for early voting to occur, except that the county board shall designate at
least five, but not more than seven, public locations for early voting if the
number of registered voters in the county is at least 150,000 but less than
300,000, and shall designate at least seven, but not more than 10, public
locations for early voting if the number of registered voters in the county is
300,000 or more. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent county
boards of elections, at their discretion, from establishing additional
locations in excess of the five, seven, or 10 location limits respectively set
forth herein; provided, however, that the State shall be required to provide
reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and including the five, seven,
or 10 respective limits established herein, and shall not be required to
provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond those limits under
section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  The number of registered
voters in each county shall be determined ahead of the selection of early
voting sites pursuant to a uniform standard which shall be developed by the
Secretary of State through the rulemaking process pursuant to the
&quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et
seq.).  Whenever possible, early voting locations shall be geographically
located so as to ensure both access in the part of the county that features the
greatest concentration of population, according to the most recent federal
decennial census of the United States, and access in various geographic areas
of the county.  All early voting locations shall be public facilities, such as
county courthouses, public libraries and the offices of the municipal clerk,
county clerk, and county board of elections, or places of public accommodation
as provided under Title 10 of the Revised Statutes. No public school building
and no building used as a public school, as that term is defined under
N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall, however, be designated as an early voting location.  The
locations shall be designated at the same time as all other polling places are
designated by the board of elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members
of the county board with respect to the selection of sites for early voting,
the county clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are
designated in each county, county boards of election shall evaluate and, if
deemed necessary, revise these locations in order to accommodate significant
changes in the number of registered voters within each county, reflect the
population distribution and density within each county, or because of similar
circumstances.  The Secretary of State may develop the criteria to be used by
county boards of election to revise the location of early voting sites and
shall prescribe how often such revision shall take place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A voter shall be permitted to
vote at any early voting site in the voter's county.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Whenever a municipality
that conducts regular municipal elections in May chooses to participate in
early voting for the regular municipal election, the county board of elections
shall designate at least one public location, but not more than three public
locations, within the municipality as the site or sites for early voting to
occur. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent a county board of
elections, at its discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess
of the three location limit set forth herein; provided, however, that the State
shall be required to provide reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and
including the three location limit established herein, and shall not be
required to provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond that limit
under section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  Whenever possible,
each such location shall be geographically located in the part of the
municipality that features the greatest concentration of population, according
to the most recent federal decennial census of the United States.  All early
voting locations shall be public facilities, such as municipal courthouses and
the offices of the municipal clerk, or places of public accommodation as
provided under Title 10 of the Revised Statutes.  No public school building and
no building used as a public school, as that term is defined under
N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall be designated as an early voting location.  The locations
shall be designated at the same time as all other polling places are designated
by the board of elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members of the
county board with respect to the selection of sites for early voting, the
municipal clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are designated
in each municipality, county boards of election shall evaluate and, if deemed
necessary, revise these locations in order to accommodate significant changes
in the number of registered voters within each municipality, reflect the
population distribution and density within each municipality, or because of
similar circumstances.  The Secretary of State may develop the criteria to be
used by county boards of election to revise the location of early voting sites
and shall prescribe how often such revision shall take place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A voter shall be permitted to
vote at any early voting site in the voter's municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Each early voting site
in a county or municipality shall be open for early voting on Monday through
Saturday from at least 10 AM to 8 PM, and on Sunday from at least 10 AM to 6
PM.  Any voter who is on line at the time scheduled for the closing of an early
voting site shall be permitted to vote.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The election officers
responsible for conducting early voting shall be the same as those responsible
for conducting a primary and a general election, as appropriate, pursuant to
this Title.  The number of such officers and their hours of service shall be as
determined by each county board of elections.  The compensation for such
officers shall be the same as provided to district board of election members
serving at a school election pursuant to R.S.19:45-6, or that required pursuant
to Article I, paragraph 23 of the New Jersey Constitution, whichever is
greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The restrictions
governing the conduct of voters at a polling place on the days that early
voting occurs, the procedures governing who is permitted in a polling place on
such occasions and the prohibition on electioneering within 100 feet of a
polling place during an election, shall be as provided in chapters 15, 34, 50
and 52 of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes and every other applicable section
of this Title.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     In real time using the
electronic poll books each day during the early voting period, and prior to the
start of each regularly scheduled primary and general election, and regular
municipal election in each non-partisan municipality choosing to participate in
early voting, each county board shall make such changes as may be necessary to
the voter's record in the Statewide voter registration system to indicate that
a voter has voted in that election using the early voting procedure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  (1)  Each county board
shall be responsible for forming and executing a written plan to ensure, to the
greatest extent possible, the integrity of the voting process and the security
of ballots used during the early voting period, including the security of
voting machines, voted ballots, and election records.  The plan shall be based
on guidelines established by the Secretary of State and shall be submitted
thereto no later than December 15 of each year.  The Secretary of State shall
review and, if deemed necessary thereby, require changes to a plan no later
than February 1 of each year.  Each plan shall specify a chain of custody and
security plan for the voting machines, and a chain of custody for the voted
ballots and election records and materials, and shall require, among other
specifications deemed necessary by the Secretary of State and county boards of
election, that all voted ballots shall be transferred at the end of each early
voting day to county boards of election for safekeeping.  After the voted
ballots are transferred to the county board of elections at the end of each
early voting day, a county board may elect to impound those voted ballots on a
secure server, or by any other means deemed appropriate by the Secretary of
State.  The voted ballots shall not be canvassed until the closing of the polls
on election day as required pursuant to section 4 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40
(C.19:15A-4). The results of the voted ballots cast during early voting shall
remain confidential and shall be disclosed only in accordance with the
provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, regulations, and guidelines
concerning the disclosure of election results, and a violation shall be subject
to the penalties established by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Notwithstanding the
provisions of this subsection, in the year in which P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1
et al.) becomes law, each county board shall submit its plan to the Secretary
of State within 30 days following the effective date of this act and the
Secretary of State shall review it and, if deemed necessary thereby, require
changes in the plan within 45 days following the effective date of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Each county board shall
make certain that each polling place used for early voting shall be accessible
to individuals with disabilities and the elderly, in compliance with the
&quot;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990&quot; (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et
seq.), and that each polling place provides such voters, including the blind
and visually impaired, the same opportunity for access and participation,
including privacy and independence, as other voters in compliance with the
&quot;Help America Vote Act of 2002&quot; (42 U.S.C. s.15481).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The Secretary of State
shall establish a printing on demand ballot and elections system.  At a
minimum, the system shall be compatible with the Statewide voter registration
system established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.145 (C.19:31-31) and
any electronic poll books provided by section 1 of P.L.2019, c.80
(C.19:31-35).  Each polling place used for early voting shall have a computer,
tablet, or other electronic device to print provisional ballots for voters
required to vote by provisional ballot in accordance with the provisions of
Title 19 of the Revised Statutes or due to an equipment malfunction as further
provided under section 3 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-37), or any other election
related material, if needed.  A computer, tablet, or other electronic device and
the printer used to print election materials at a polling place shall not be
used unless it has been certified by the Secretary of State.  The Secretary of
State shall adopt and publish standards and regulations governing the
certification and use of computer, tablets, or other electronic devices and
printers to print election materials at each polling place used for early
voting.  The Secretary of State shall not certify a computer, tablet, or other
electronic device or printer unless it is in compliance with the secretary's
standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     Each polling place used
for early voting shall also have such appropriate supplies, ballots and other
materials deemed necessary by the Secretary of State or as is required
currently for a polling place on the day of any election by Title 19 of the
Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill extends the early
voting period for certain elections in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill extends the early
voting period for all primary and general elections in New Jersey to start 11
calendar days before the election.  This includes non-presidential primary
elections, presidential primary elections, and general elections.  The bill
also allows municipalities to extend the early voting period for May municipal
elections to start 11 calendar days before the election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, the early voting
period for a non-presidential primary election starts on the 4th calendar day
before the election.  The early voting period for a presidential primary
election starts on the 6th calendar day before the election.  The early voting
period for a general election starts on the 10th calendar day before the
election.  The early voting period for a May regular municipal election begins
on the 4th calendar day before the election. This bill starts the early voting
period on the 11th calendar day before the non-presidential primary,
presidential primary, general election, and allows municipalities to adopt an
ordinance to begin early voting for May municipal elections on the 11th
calendar day before the regular municipal election.  Under current law, the
early voting period for any election ends on the second calendar day before the
election. Therefore, under the bill, the early voting period would consist of
ten days for these elections.</p>
