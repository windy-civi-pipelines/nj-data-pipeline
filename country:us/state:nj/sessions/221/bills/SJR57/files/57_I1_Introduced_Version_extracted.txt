Many children with mental health disorders do not receive treatment for their illnesses, due to poor understanding of mental illness and treatment options, stigma or lack of access to treatment.  The resolution intends to promote awareness in hopes of improving the lives of children who have emotional disturbances and other mental health disorders.
