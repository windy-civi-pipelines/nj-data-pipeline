(1) By 11:59 p.m. on the day of each primary and general election, and by 9 p.m. of every day thereafter until all eligible ballots have been counted and the election is certified, each county clerk, in consultation with the county board of elections of that county, shall list in an easily accessible location on the county clerk's Internet site an unofficial report detailing the number and types of ballots that have been received and, to the extent practicable, the number and types of ballots that have been counted and that remain to be counted in that election.  The reports required by this subsection shall include a date and time stamp designating the date and time of each report, except that nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to require the county board of elections in each county to conduct the count of ballots on a daily basis.  Each report shall detail, at the legislative district, municipal, and county levels, the following categories of information: (a) for the in-person early voting period, the number of early voting machines or voting equipment deployed, the number of early voting machines or voting equipment not included in the tally, and the total number of votes cast during the early voting period; (b) for the election day vote, the number of election day voting machines or voting equipment deployed, the number of election day voting machines or voting equipment not included in the tally, and the total number of votes cast in person on election day; and (c) for the vote-by-mail vote, the number of vote-by-mail ballots that have been issued and received into the Statewide Voter Registration System, as well as the vote-by-mail ballots that have been tallied and that remain to be processed. (2) Each county clerk, in consultation with the county board of elections of that county, shall send to the Secretary of State the reports required to be created and posted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection at the time of each posting.  Upon receiving each report, the Secretary of State shall provide in an easily identifiable location on the Internet site of the Division of Elections access to the county by county totals for each category included in the reports.  The county by county totals required to be created and posted under this paragraph shall include a date and time stamp designating the date and time of the posting. (3) With each report and posting required pursuant to this subsection, each county clerk and the Division of Elections shall note on their respective Internet sites that the reports and postings are unofficial and subject to change as each county clerk and county board of elections, as appropriate, receive and process ballots that have been cast in the election.  The unofficial tally of election results and the daily reports shall not be interpreted to serve as the legal basis for the contest of any election.  The Secretary of State, in consultation with county clerks and county boards of elections, shall promulgate uniform guidelines for all county clerks to follow in creating the reports and postings required by this subsection.  In addition to the uniform guidelines, the Secretary of State shall develop a template for standardized reporting for all counties to follow.

(c) Not later than 30 days after each primary and general election is certified, each county clerk, in consultation with the commissioner of registration and the county board of elections of that county, shall list in an easily identifiable location on the county clerks Internet site an unofficial report detailing the final number and the results of eligible provisional ballots that have been counted and certified in each election district. (cf: P.L.2023, c.131, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the reporting of provisional ballot data in each election district for primary and general elections. Under current law, certain reporting of provisional ballots is required after each primary and general election.  On the day after each primary and general election, and by 9 p.m. of every day thereafter, each county clerk is required to publicly list an unofficial report of the total number of provisional ballots cast during the early voting period and on election day.  Additionally, beginning on the seventh day after each primary and general election and by 9 p.m. on each day thereafter until the election is certified, each county clerk is required to publicly list an unofficial report detailing the number of eligible provisional ballots that have been received. This bill requires the reporting of provisional ballots of each primary and general election to begin on the day of the primary and general election, instead of the day after each primary and general election.  This bill requires the provisional ballot reporting to be specified by election district and requires the results of the provisional ballots cast to be included in the reporting.  This bill also requires each county clerk to provide a final report of the number of provisional ballots cast during each primary and general election and the results of the provisional ballots cast, specified by election district, no later than 30 days after the election is certified.
