(cf: P.L.2019, c.39, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all contracts and agreements entered into, renewed, modified, or amended on or after the effective date. STATEMENT This bill bars provisions in employment contracts that waive certain rights or remedies.  Specifically, the bill clarifies that the current law on non-disclosure provisions also prohibits certain non-disparagement provisions in employment contracts. The bill also removes a provision of current that provides that the prohibition on non-disclosure agreements does not apply to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement between an employer and the collective bargaining representative of the employees.
