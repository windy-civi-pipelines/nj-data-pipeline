A3756 ASSEMBLY, No. 3756 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 22, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  CAROL A. MURPHY District 7 (Burlington) SYNOPSIS Authorizes counties to establish diversionary program for juveniles to attend New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning juvenile diversion and supplementing Title 2A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  The governing body of a county may, by ordinance or resolution, establish a diversionary program for eligible juveniles, as set forth in subsection b. of this section, pursuant to which the juvenile is referred to the New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy. The ordinance or resolution shall provide that the charges against a juvenile are to be dismissed if the juvenile successfully completes the New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy Program pursuant to this section. b.    A juvenile against whom a complaint is filed for the first time pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-30) for a petty disorderly persons offense, disorderly persons offense, crime of the fourth degree, or crime of the third degree, excluding an offense involving a controlled dangerous substance pursuant to chapter 35 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes, is eligible for the diversionary program established in this section, provided the juvenile meets the eligibility requirements of the New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy. c.     The county prosecutor shall be notified if a juvenile is diverted pursuant to this section. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill authorizes counties to establish a diversionary program for certain first time juvenile offenders to be referred to the New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy. Criminal charges against a juvenile who successfully completes the New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy Program are to be dismissed.  The diversionary program is available to juveniles charged with a petty disorderly persons offense, disorderly persons offense, crime of the fourth degree, or crime of the third degree.  Juveniles charged with a drug offense are not eligible for the diversionary program under the bill.  In addition, the juvenile is required to meet the eligibility requirements of the academy. The New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy operates under the auspices of the federal National Guard Youth Challenge Program (NGYCP).  The purpose of the NGYCP is to assist high school dropouts who have not earned a high school diploma in leading successful, productive lives.  The NGYCP endeavors to improve the life skills and employment potential of participants by providing military-based training and supervised work experience. The NGYCP assists the participants in obtaining a high school diploma or its equivalent, developing leadership skills, promoting fellowship and community service, developing life coping skills and job skills, and improving physical fitness and health and hygiene.  The NGYCP is administered by the federal Secretary of Defense, who may enter into an agreement with the Governor of a state to implement a state youth challenge program, such as the New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy.  The federal government funds 75 percent of the operating costs of New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy; the State funds the remaining 25 percent. Federal law specifies that dropouts from secondary school are to be eligible to participate in the program.  To be eligible for a NGYCP, the juvenile is required to be: (1) 16 to 18 years of age at time of entry into the program; (2) a school dropout from secondary school; (3) a citizen or legal resident of the United States; and (4) unemployed or under-employed.  Further, the juvenile currently may not be on parole or probation for other than a juvenile status offense, may not be awaiting sentencing, and may not be under indictment, accused, or convicted of a felony.  The program is available only to those eligible juveniles who voluntarily apply; an eligible juvenile cannot be required to participate and a parent is not authorized to enroll a juvenile. This bill provides first time juvenile offenders charged with low level offenses an opportunity to have those charges dismissed if they successfully complete the New Jersey Youth Challenge Academy program.
