the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 12 of P.L.1971,
c.136 (C.26:2H-12) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  a.  No health care
service or health care facility shall be operated unless it shall: (1) possess
a valid license issued pursuant to <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>this
act<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>] </span></b><u>P.L.1971,
c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.)</u>, which license shall specify the kind or kinds of
health care services the facility is authorized to provide; (2) establish and
maintain a uniform system of cost accounting approved by the commissioner; (3)
establish and maintain a uniform system of reports and audits meeting the
requirements of the commissioner; (4) prepare and review annually a long range
plan for the provision of health care services; and (5) establish and maintain
a centralized, coordinated system of discharge planning which assures every
patient a planned program of continuing care and which meets the requirements
of the commissioner which requirements shall, where feasible, equal or exceed
those standards and regulations established by the federal government for all
federally-funded health care facilities but shall not require any person who is
not in receipt of State or federal assistance to be discharged against his
will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) Application for a
license for a health care service or health care facility shall be made upon
forms prescribed by the department.  The department shall charge a single,
nonrefundable fee for the filing of an application for and issuance of a
license and a single, nonrefundable fee for any renewal thereof, and a single,
nonrefundable fee for a biennial inspection of the facility, as it shall from
time to time fix in rules or regulations; provided, however, that no such
licensing fee shall exceed $10,000 in the case of a hospital and $4,000 in the
case of any other health care facility for all services provided by the
hospital or other health care facility, and no such inspection fee shall exceed
$5,000 in the case of a hospital and $2,000 in the case of any other health
care facility for all services provided by the hospital or other health care
facility.  No inspection fee shall be charged for inspections other than
biennial inspections.  Any surgical practice required to apply for licensure by
the department as an ambulatory care facility pursuant to P.L.2017, c.283 shall
be exempt from the initial and renewal license fees required by this section. 
The application shall contain the name of the health care facility, the kind or
kinds of health care service to be provided, the location and physical
description of the institution, and such other information as the department
may require. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A license shall be
issued by the department upon its findings that the premises, equipment,
personnel, including principals and management, finances, rules and bylaws, and
standards of health care service are fit and adequate and there is reasonable
assurance the health care facility will be operated in the manner required by <b><span

c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.)</u> and rules and regulations thereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The department shall
post on its Internet website each inspection report prepared following an
inspection of a residential health care facility, as defined in section 1 of
P.L.1953, c.212 (C.30:11A-1) or licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1
et seq.), that is performed pursuant to this subsection, along with any other
inspection report prepared by or on behalf of the department for such facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If an inspection reveals a
serious health and safety violation at a residential health care facility, the
department shall post the inspection report, including the name of the facility
and the owner of the facility, on its website no later than 72 hours following
the inspection.  If a license of a residential health care facility is
suspended, the department shall post the suspension on its website no later
than 72 hours following the suspension.  The department shall update its website
to reflect the correction of a serious health and safety violation, and the
lifting of a suspension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The department shall notify,
as soon as possible, the Commissioner of Human Services, or the commissioner's
designee, and the director of the county board of social services or county
welfare agency, as appropriate, in the county in which a residential health
care facility is located, of a serious health and safety violation at the
facility and of any suspension of a license to operate such facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the inspection
responsibilities under this subsection with respect to such facility are
transferred or otherwise assigned to another department, that other department
shall post on its Internet website each inspection report prepared following an
inspection of such facility performed pursuant to this subsection, along with
any other inspection report prepared by or on behalf of that department for
such facility, and shall comply with the other requirements specified in this
subsection.</p>
