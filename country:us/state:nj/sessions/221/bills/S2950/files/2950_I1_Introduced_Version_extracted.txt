[b.] c.        Upon a violation of subsection a. or b. of this section, an employee or former employee may, as an alternative to any action that the employee is permitted to take for the violation pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.), or the "Family Leave Act," P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.), institute a civil action in the Superior Court for relief[. All] in which all remedies available in common law tort actions shall be available to a prevailing plaintiff.  The court may also order any or all of the following relief: (1)  an assessment of a civil fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $2,000 for the first violation of any of the provisions of this section and not more than $5,000 for each subsequent violation; (2)  an injunction to restrain the continued violation of any of the provisions of this section; (3)  reinstatement of the employee to the same position or to a position equivalent to that which the employee held prior to unlawful discharge or retaliatory action, or other failure to reinstate the employee in violation of this section; (4)  reinstatement of full fringe benefits and seniority rights; (5)  compensation for any lost wages, benefits and other remuneration; and (6)  payment of reasonable costs and attorney's fees. d.    An employee who is eligible for both earned sick leave pursuant to P.L.2018, c.10 (C.34:11D-1 et seq.), and either  temporary disability benefits pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21- 25 et al.), or family temporary disability leave benefits pursuant to P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) shall have the option of using either the earned sick leave or whichever is applicable of temporary disability benefits or family temporary disability leave benefits, and may select the order in which the different kinds of leave are taken, but shall not receive more than one kind of paid leave simultaneously during any period of time. (cf: P.L.2019, c.37, s.24) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill extends to employees of employers with less than 30 employees and five or more employees the right to be reinstated to employment after taking family temporary disability leave benefits or unpaid family leave, thus ensuring that more workers who pay for family temporary disability leave insurance (FLI) will be able to able to return to work after taking FLI benefits.  The extension is phased in, with the threshold reduced to 20 employees upon the effective date of the bill, to 10 employees one year later after the effective date, and to five employees two years after the effective date.  Under the bill, upon completion of the phase-in, employees of employers with five or more employees will be entitled to 12 weeks of job protected leave, whether that leave is paid or unpaid. Once the phase-in is complete, the bill extends to employees of employers with five or more employees, the provision under current law that provides that a covered employee who takes FLI benefits to care for a family member has an affirmative right of job reinstatement with their employer after the leave.  Currently, an employer who employs less than 30 workers, and is thus exempt from the reinstatement requirements of the Family Leave Act (FLA), is also exempt from the reinstatement requirements of that provision.  By reducing this exemption, the bill extends that provisions reinstatement rights to recipients of FLI benefits even if their employers have less than 30 employees, in the same way that provision currently provides that reinstatement protection for temporary disability insurance recipients no matter how few employees the employer has. Once fully phased in, the bill also amends the FLA to make employers of five or more employees subject to that laws requirement to reinstate leave takers, thereby extending that right of reinstatement to employees of employers with five or more employees, whether or not the employees receive FLI benefits. The bill provides that an employee who is eligible for both earned sick leave, and either temporary disability benefits or family temporary disability leave benefits will have the option of using either the earned sick leave or whichever is applicable of temporary disability benefits or family temporary disability leave benefits, and may select the order in which the different kinds of leave are taken, but may not receive more than one kind of paid leave simultaneously during any period of time.
