(2)   Practitioners who are required to access prescription monitoring information pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2015, c.74 (C.45:1-46.1) may discharge that responsibility by accessing one or more authorized electronic systems into which the prescription monitoring information maintained by the division has been integrated. (cf: P.L.2017, c.341, s.3) 12.  Section 5 of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.29) is amended to read as follows: 5.    (A) The contract or contracts purchased by the commission pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.28) shall provide separate coverages or policies as follows: (1)   Basic benefits which shall include: (a)   Hospital benefits, including outpatient; (b)   Surgical benefits; (c)   Inpatient medical benefits; (d)   Obstetrical benefits; and (e)   Services rendered by an extended care facility or by a home health agency and for specified medical care visits by a physician during an eligible period of such services, without regard to whether the patient has been hospitalized, to the extent and subject to the conditions and limitations agreed to by the commission and the carrier or carriers. Basic benefits shall be substantially equivalent to those available on a group remittance basis to employees of the State and their dependents under the subscription contracts of the New Jersey "Blue Cross" and "Blue Shield" Plans.

The commission may, by regulation, determine what types of services and supplies shall be included as "eligible medical services" under the major medical expense benefits coverage as well as those which shall be excluded from or limited under such coverage. Benefit payments for major medical expense benefits shall be equal to a percentage of the reasonable charges for eligible medical services incurred by a covered employee or an employee's covered dependent, during a calendar year as exceed a deductible for such calendar year of $100.00 subject to the maximums hereinafter provided and to the other terms and conditions authorized by this act. The percentage shall be 80% of the first $2,000.00 of charges for eligible medical services incurred subsequent to satisfaction of the deductible and 100% thereafter. There shall be a separate deductible for each calendar year for (a) each enrolled employee and (b) all enrolled dependents of such employee. Not more than $1,000,000.00 shall be paid for major medical expense benefits with respect to any one person for the entire period of such person's coverage under the plan, whether continuous or interrupted except that this maximum may be reapplied to a covered person in amounts not to exceed $2,000.00 a year. Maximums of $10,000.00 per calendar year and $20,000.00 for the entire period of the person's coverage under the plan shall apply to eligible expenses incurred because of mental illness or functional nervous disorders, and such may be reapplied to a covered person, except as provided in P.L.1999, c.441 (C.52:14-17.29d et al.).

Under the conditions agreed upon by the commission and the carriers as set forth in the contract, the deductible for a calendar year may be satisfied in whole or in part by eligible charges incurred during the last three months of the prior calendar year. Any service determined by regulation of the commission to be an "eligible medical service" under the major medical expense benefits coverage which is performed by a duly licensed practicing psychologist within the lawful scope of his practice shall be recognized for reimbursement under the same conditions as would apply were such service performed by a physician. (B)  The contract or contracts purchased by the commission pursuant to subsection c. of section 4 of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.28) shall include coverage for services and benefits that are at a level that is equal to or exceeds the level of services and benefits set forth in this subsection, provided that such services and benefits shall include only those that are eligible medical services and not those deemed experimental, investigative or otherwise not eligible medical services.

STATEMENT This bill establishes requirements for patients to access emergency supplies of insulin and provides for insurance coverage of emergency insulin. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health (DOH) to maintain an adequate emergency stockpile of insulin as is necessary to meet the emergency needs of people in New Jersey whose insulin supply has or will run out before the persons next prescription may be filled.  At a minimum, the emergency stockpile is include the 10 most common brands and types of insulin used by New Jersey residents. The DOH will be required to collaborate with the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance to determine which brands and types of insulin are most commonly used in New Jersey. In determining the quantity of insulin the DOH will need to maintain under the bill, the DOH will be required to take into account prevailing conditions in the State that may affect the need for and availability of insulin; take into account anticipated surges, over the next 90 days, in the need for emergency supplies of insulin; take into consideration the current state of the supply chain of insulin in the State, including, but not limited to, unit cost, recent price increases, overall availability, and delays in shipping times; and utilize any other tool as the DOH designates for use in determining the anticipated need for emergency insulin.  The DOH will be required to reevaluate the adequacy of its emergency stockpile of insulin at least quarterly and acquire such additional supplies of insulin, and such additional brands and types of insulin, as it determines are necessary to meet the need for emergency insulin in New Jersey. The DOH will be required to develop a sourcing protocol to acquire insulin for its emergency stockpile that maximizes the cost effectiveness of the program and secures the best available consumer price for each insulin product. The DOH will be required to develop a program under which the DOH will furnish emergency insulin, at cost, to individuals whose insulin supply has or will run out before the persons next prescription may be filled.  The DOH will be authorized to seek reimbursement for the emergency insulin from the persons health benefits plan, if any, or accept cash payment from the person.  The department may establish standards and procedures to verify whether a persons insulin supply has or will run out before the persons next prescription may be filled. The bill additionally authorizes pharmacists to dispense an emergency 30-day supply of insulin once every 12 months, which emergency supply of insulin may be dispensed pursuant to a standing order issued by a prescriber or pursuant to the standing order issued by the DOH under the bill.  In order to dispense emergency insulin to a person under the bill, the pharmacist will need to:  have a record of a previous prescription for insulin for that person, which prescription was dispensed within the past year; have been unable to obtain authorization for an additional supply of insulin from an authorized prescriber; and ensure the amount of insulin dispensed in the emergency 30-day supply does not exceed the amount that was dispensed under the most recent prescription for insulin dispensed by the pharmacy to that person. The Commissioner of Health, or, if the commissioner is not a duly licensed physician, the Deputy Commissioner for Public Health Services, will be required to issue a standing order authorizing all licensed pharmacists in the State to dispense emergency insulin under the bill.  The Commissioner of Health is to provide a copy of the standing order to the Board of Pharmacy, which will post a copy of the standing order on the board's Internet website and transmit a copy of the standing order to all licensed pharmacists in such a manner as the board deems appropriate. In general, individuals may not receive more than one emergency 30-day supply of insulin in a given 12-month period, regardless of whether the emergency insulin was dispensed by the DOH or a pharmacist.  However, the bill authorizes the DOH to furnish additional emergency supplies of insulin to a person based on demonstrated need.  The bill specifies that additional emergency supplies dispensed by the DOH over an emergency 30-day supply will not be subject to the insurance coverage requirements of the bill. The DOH and pharmacists will be required to report each emergency 30-day supply of insulin dispensed under the bill to the prescription monitoring database maintained pursuant to P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-44 et al.) and will be required, prior to dispensing an emergency 30-day supply of insulin, to review the persons prescription monitoring information to determine whether the person was dispensed an emergency 30-day supply of insulin by the DOH or by a pharmacy in the preceding 12 months. The bill requires health insurers, Medicaid, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Program to provide coverage for emergency 30-day supplies of insulin dispensed under the bill at least once every 12 months. The coverage requirement includes the health benefits plan of a hospital, medical or health service corporation, individual, small employer, large group commercial insurer, and health maintenance organization.

(3)   The division shall establish a process by which a patient, or the parent or legal guardian of a child who is a patient, may request a pharmacy permit holder that submitted prescription monitoring information concerning a prescription for controlled dangerous substances for that patient or child to the division pursuant to sections 25 through 30 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-45 through C.45:1-50) to correct information that the person believes to have been inaccurately entered into that patient's or child's prescription profile.  Upon confirmation of the inaccuracy of any such entry into a patient's or child's prescription profile, the pharmacy permit holder shall be authorized to correct any such inaccuracies by submitting corrected information to the division pursuant to sections 25 through 30 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-45 through C.45:1-50).  The process shall provide for review by the Board of Pharmacy of any disputed request for correction, which determination shall be appealable to the director. p.    The division shall take steps to ensure that appropriate channels of communication exist to enable any licensed health care professional, licensed pharmacist, mental health practitioner, pharmacy permit holder, or other practitioner who has online access to the Prescription Monitoring Program pursuant to this section to seek or provide information to the division related to the provisions of this section. q. (1) The division may make prescription monitoring information available on electronic systems that collect and display health information, such as an electronic system that connects hospital emergency departments for the purpose of transmitting and obtaining patient health data from multiple sources, or an electronic system that notifies practitioners of information pertaining to the treatment of overdoses; provided that the division determines that any such electronic system has appropriate security protections in place. (2)   Practitioners who are required to access prescription monitoring information pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2015, c.74 (C.45:1-46.1) may discharge that responsibility by accessing one or more authorized electronic systems into which the prescription monitoring information maintained by the division has been integrated. (cf: P.L.2017, c.341, s.3) 12.  Section 5 of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.29) is amended to read as follows: 5.    (A) The contract or contracts purchased by the commission pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.28) shall provide separate coverages or policies as follows: (1)   Basic benefits which shall include: (a)   Hospital benefits, including outpatient; (b)   Surgical benefits; (c)   Inpatient medical benefits; (d)   Obstetrical benefits; and (e)   Services rendered by an extended care facility or by a home health agency and for specified medical care visits by a physician during an eligible period of such services, without regard to whether the patient has been hospitalized, to the extent and subject to the conditions and limitations agreed to by the commission and the carrier or carriers. Basic benefits shall be substantially equivalent to those available on a group remittance basis to employees of the State and their dependents under the subscription contracts of the New Jersey "Blue Cross" and "Blue Shield" Plans.

The commission may, by regulation, determine what types of services and supplies shall be included as "eligible medical services" under the major medical expense benefits coverage as well as those which shall be excluded from or limited under such coverage. Benefit payments for major medical expense benefits shall be equal to a percentage of the reasonable charges for eligible medical services incurred by a covered employee or an employee's covered dependent, during a calendar year as exceed a deductible for such calendar year of $100.00 subject to the maximums hereinafter provided and to the other terms and conditions authorized by this act. The percentage shall be 80% of the first $2,000.00 of charges for eligible medical services incurred subsequent to satisfaction of the deductible and 100% thereafter. There shall be a separate deductible for each calendar year for (a) each enrolled employee and (b) all enrolled dependents of such employee. Not more than $1,000,000.00 shall be paid for major medical expense benefits with respect to any one person for the entire period of such person's coverage under the plan, whether continuous or interrupted except that this maximum may be reapplied to a covered person in amounts not to exceed $2,000.00 a year. Maximums of $10,000.00 per calendar year and $20,000.00 for the entire period of the person's coverage under the plan shall apply to eligible expenses incurred because of mental illness or functional nervous disorders, and such may be reapplied to a covered person, except as provided in P.L.1999, c.441 (C.52:14-17.29d et al.). The same provisions shall apply for retired employees and their dependents. Under the conditions agreed upon by the commission and the carriers as set forth in the contract, the deductible for a calendar year may be satisfied in whole or in part by eligible charges incurred during the last three months of the prior calendar year. Any service determined by regulation of the commission to be an "eligible medical service" under the major medical expense benefits coverage which is performed by a duly licensed practicing psychologist within the lawful scope of his practice shall be recognized for reimbursement under the same conditions as would apply were such service performed by a physician. (B)  The contract or contracts purchased by the commission pursuant to subsection c. of section 4 of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.28) shall include coverage for services and benefits that are at a level that is equal to or exceeds the level of services and benefits set forth in this subsection, provided that such services and benefits shall include only those that are eligible medical services and not those deemed experimental, investigative or otherwise not eligible medical services.

STATEMENT This bill establishes requirements for patients to access emergency supplies of insulin and provides for insurance coverage of emergency insulin. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health (DOH) to maintain an adequate emergency stockpile of insulin as is necessary to meet the emergency needs of people in New Jersey whose insulin supply has or will run out before the persons next prescription may be filled.  At a minimum, the emergency stockpile is include the 10 most common brands and types of insulin used by New Jersey residents. The DOH will be required to collaborate with the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance to determine which brands and types of insulin are most commonly used in New Jersey. In determining the quantity of insulin the DOH will need to maintain under the bill, the DOH will be required to take into account prevailing conditions in the State that may affect the need for and availability of insulin; take into account anticipated surges, over the next 90 days, in the need for emergency supplies of insulin; take into consideration the current state of the supply chain of insulin in the State, including, but not limited to, unit cost, recent price increases, overall availability, and delays in shipping times; and utilize any other tool as the DOH designates for use in determining the anticipated need for emergency insulin.  The DOH will be required to reevaluate the adequacy of its emergency stockpile of insulin at least quarterly and acquire such additional supplies of insulin, and such additional brands and types of insulin, as it determines are necessary to meet the need for emergency insulin in New Jersey. The DOH will be required to develop a sourcing protocol to acquire insulin for its emergency stockpile that maximizes the cost effectiveness of the program and secures the best available consumer price for each insulin product. The DOH will be required to develop a program under which the DOH will furnish emergency insulin, at cost, to individuals whose insulin supply has or will run out before the persons next prescription may be filled.  The DOH will be authorized to seek reimbursement for the emergency insulin from the persons health benefits plan, if any, or accept cash payment from the person.  The department may establish standards and procedures to verify whether a persons insulin supply has or will run out before the persons next prescription may be filled. The bill additionally authorizes pharmacists to dispense an emergency 30-day supply of insulin once every 12 months, which emergency supply of insulin may be dispensed pursuant to a standing order issued by a prescriber or pursuant to the standing order issued by the DOH under the bill.  In order to dispense emergency insulin to a person under the bill, the pharmacist will need to:  have a record of a previous prescription for insulin for that person, which prescription was dispensed within the past year; have been unable to obtain authorization for an additional supply of insulin from an authorized prescriber; and ensure the amount of insulin dispensed in the emergency 30-day supply does not exceed the amount that was dispensed under the most recent prescription for insulin dispensed by the pharmacy to that person. The Commissioner of Health, or, if the commissioner is not a duly licensed physician, the Deputy Commissioner for Public Health Services, will be required to issue a standing order authorizing all licensed pharmacists in the State to dispense emergency insulin under the bill.  The Commissioner of Health is to provide a copy of the standing order to the Board of Pharmacy, which will post a copy of the standing order on the board's Internet website and transmit a copy of the standing order to all licensed pharmacists in such a manner as the board deems appropriate. In general, individuals may not receive more than one emergency 30-day supply of insulin in a given 12-month period, regardless of whether the emergency insulin was dispensed by the DOH or a pharmacist.  However, the bill authorizes the DOH to furnish additional emergency supplies of insulin to a person based on demonstrated need.  The bill specifies that additional emergency supplies dispensed by the DOH over an emergency 30-day supply will not be subject to the insurance coverage requirements of the bill. The DOH and pharmacists will be required to report each emergency 30-day supply of insulin dispensed under the bill to the prescription monitoring database maintained pursuant to P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-44 et al.) and will be required, prior to dispensing an emergency 30-day supply of insulin, to review the persons prescription monitoring information to determine whether the person was dispensed an emergency 30-day supply of insulin by the DOH or by a pharmacy in the preceding 12 months. The bill requires health insurers, Medicaid, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Program to provide coverage for emergency 30-day supplies of insulin dispensed under the bill at least once every 12 months. The coverage requirement includes the health benefits plan of a hospital, medical or health service corporation, individual, small employer, large group commercial insurer, and health maintenance organization.
