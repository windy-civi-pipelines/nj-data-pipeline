SPEARMAN District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) Assemblyman  CRAIG J. COUGHLIN District 19 (Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Affirms support for SNAP and programs progress in reducing hunger among vulnerable populations in New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Assembly Resolution affirming support for SNAP and the programs progress in reducing hunger among vulnerable populations in New Jersey. Whereas, On February 25, 2025, the United States House of Representatives passed a budget resolution seeking to cut a minimum of $1.5 trillion over ten years from the federal budget to meet spending targets aimed at funding the current administrations domestic priorities; and Whereas, To achieve this goal, on May 14, 2025 the House Agriculture Committee voted in favor of a bill that would reduce up to $300 billion in food aid funding over this same time period; and Whereas, On May 22, 2025 the House of Representatives passed a budget bill which included the Agriculture Committees funding reductions; and Whereas, These cuts are aimed at and will largely fall on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a safety net program that supports food insecure individuals and families across the country; and Whereas, New Jersey has a substantial number of food insecure people living in the State, demonstrating the critical need to maintain participation in SNAP; and Whereas, According to Feeding America, nearly 1.1 million people in New Jersey are food insecure - a staggering 65 percent increase since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020; and Whereas, Nearly 850,000 residents in New Jersey, or nine percent of the total population, rely on SNAP benefits to feed their families; and Whereas, A significant number of the households that participate in SNAP include some of the States most vulnerable members: the elderly, disabled, veterans, and children; and Whereas, The New Jersey General Assembly supports State and federal collaboration to identify programmatic efficiencies within SNAP; however, budgetary cost savings at the expense of stripping children, seniors, and families of safety net food and nutrition services is unconscionable; and Whereas, It is fitting and proper for the New Jersey General Assembly to defend the States most vulnerable residents from these drastic proposed federal funding reductions to SNAP; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The New Jersey General Assembly supports SNAP and the programs progress in reducing hunger among vulnerable populations in New Jersey.  The General Assembly condemns the United States House of Representatives for approving federal cuts to this program within the budget bill passed on May 22, 2025, and urges the United States Senate to reject these, or any subsequent proposals, which would achieve federal cost savings at the expense of food insecure children, seniors, and families. 2.    The Clerk of the General Assembly shall transmit copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, to the President of the United States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and every member of the United States Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution affirms support for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the programs progress in reducing hunger among vulnerable populations in New Jersey.  The resolution condemns the United States House of Representatives for approving, and urges the United States Senate to reject, federal cuts to SNAP. On May 22, 2025, to achieve a minimum $1.5 trillion cut from the federal budget over a ten year period, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a budget bill that included a $300 billion cut in food aid funding, largely aimed at SNAP. In New Jersey, SNAP is a critical resource for residents, with nearly 850,000 individuals, or nine percent of the total population, relying on the programs benefits to feed their families.  A significant number of the households that participate in SNAP include some of the States most vulnerable members: the elderly, disabled, veterans, and children. The New Jersey General Assembly supports State and federal collaboration to identify programmatic efficiencies within SNAP; however, budgetary cost savings implemented at the expense of stripping income-limited children, seniors, and families of safety net food and nutrition services is unconscionable.  The General Assembly condemns the House for adopting these drastic federal funding reductions, and urges the Senate to reject these, or any subsequent, proposals and to maintain SNAP as an accessible resource for those in need of food assistance.
