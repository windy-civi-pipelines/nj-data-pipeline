(2) include supporting information and documentation explaining why the proposed level of benefit is both reasonable and necessary; and (3) include any other information required by the board. The board shall issue a decision on the petition no later than 180 days after receipt thereof. (cf: P.L.1991, c.381, s.40) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend the law pertaining to the establishment of host community benefit agreements for municipalities in which sanitary landfill facilities or solid waste transfer stations operate, in order to provide for greater public input with respect to the establishment and terms of such agreements and greater transparency and finality in the host community benefit negotiation process. Current law provides that any municipality in which a sanitary landfill facility or transfer station is located is entitled to receive an annual economic benefit, to be paid by the owner or operator of the facility or transfer station.  The amount and form of the benefit are to be established pursuant to an agreement that is executed between the municipality and the sanitary landfill facility or transfer station and is approved by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or the Board of Public Utilities (BPU), as appropriate.  This bill would:  (1) establish a specific timeframe for the completion of host community benefit negotiations between a municipality and a sanitary landfill facility or transfer station; (2) require the municipality to publish the proposed agreement online, for public comment, prior to submitting the proposed agreement to the DEP or BPU for approval; (3) require the DEP or BPU to establish the host community benefit for a municipality in any case where the parties are negotiating in bad faith or otherwise fail to come to an agreement on the host community benefit; and (4) authorize any resident to petition the DEP or BPU for an order establishing or adjusting a host community benefit in the municipality. The bill provides, in particular, that, not more than 10 days after negotiations are commenced between a municipality and a sanitary landfill facility or transfer station to establish a host community benefit, the municipality will be required to provide written notice to the DEP or BPU, as appropriate, indicating the date on which negotiations were commenced.  Negotiations are to be completed not more than 180 days after being commenced; however, if negotiations cannot be completed within this timeframe, the parties may jointly apply to the DEP or BPU for an extension of up to 180 days to complete the negotiations and publish the proposed agreement.  An application for extension is to identify the reasons why negotiations were not completed within the initial 180-day timeframe required by the bill.  The DEP or BPU, as appropriate, will be required to approve an application for extension, so long as there is no reasonable basis for the commissioner or the board, as appropriate, to believe that the municipality or the sanitary landfill facility or transfer station, as appropriate, are acting in bad faith with respect to the negotiations.  Notice of an extension authorized under the bill is to be posted on the Internet websites of both the municipality and the DEP or BPU, as appropriate, within 10 days after the extension is granted. The bill also provides that, not more than 10 days after negotiations are completed in accordance with the timeframes specified by the bill, and before the proposed host community benefit agreement is submitted to the DEP or BPU for approval, the municipality is to publish the proposed host community benefit agreement on its Internet website and provide a minimum 45-day period for public comment on the proposed agreement.  Not more than 45 days after the public comment period is closed, the parties will be required to consider the comments received and incorporate changes to the proposed host community benefit agreement, in accordance with those comments, as is deemed by the parties to be appropriate.  Upon submission of the proposed agreement to the DEP or BPU for approval, the municipality will also be required to transmit the public comments to the DEP or BPU for consideration. If an application for extension of the negotiation period is denied by the DEP or the BPU on the basis of bad faith negotiations undertaken by either party, or if the parties otherwise cannot agree on the terms of the host community benefit agreement within the initial and extended timeframes specified by the bill, the DEP or BPU, as appropriate, will be required to issue an order establishing a host community benefit in the municipality as the commissioner or board deems appropriate.  When establishing a host community benefit, the commissioner or board will be required to consider, and incorporate to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the other provisions of the order, any terms on which the parties were able to reach agreement during the course of negotiations. Finally, the bill authorizes any resident of a municipality in which a sanitary landfill facility or transfer station is located to, at any time, petition the DEP or the BPU for an order establishing or adjusting a host community benefit in the municipality.  Any such petition is to:  (1) indicate the level of benefit that the petitioner believes should be imposed; (2) include supporting information and documentation explaining why the proposed level of benefit is both reasonable and necessary; and (3) include any other information required by the DEP or BPU, as appropriate.  The DEP or BPU, as the case may be, will be required to issue a decision on the petition no later than 180 days after receipt thereof.
