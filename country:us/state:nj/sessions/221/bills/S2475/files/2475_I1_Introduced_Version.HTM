The increase would be provided only on January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024. The increase would be calculated in the same way that such increases were calculated when such increases were provided annually under the pension adjustment law, N.J.S.A.43:3B-1 et seq.; these annual increases were ended by law in 2011. However, the increase under this bill will be 100 percent of the change in the Consumer Price Index, instead of the 60 percent provided by the pension adjustment law. The bill requires the State to fund the cost of these increases and makes an appropriation for that purpose.
