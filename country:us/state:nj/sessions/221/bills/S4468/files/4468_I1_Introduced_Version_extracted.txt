"Prime rate" means prime rate as that term is defined by R.S.54:48-2 and as is determined and redetermined by Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury for purposes of setting and assessing interest due and required to be paid in connection with a delinquent or deficient payment of a State tax pursuant to R.S.54:49-3 or R.S.54:49-6, respectively. (cf: P.L.2020, c.34, s.10) 18.  Section 3 of P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-3) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in this act: a.     "Authority means the New Jersey Water Supply Authority created by [this act] P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.); b.    "Bonds means bonds, notes, or other obligations issued or authorized pursuant to [this act] P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.); c.     "Compensating reservoir"  means the structures, facilities, and appurtenances for the impounding, transportation, and release of water for the replenishment in periods of drought or at other necessary times of all or a part of waters in or bordering the State diverted into a project; d.    "Cost"  as applied to a project means the cost of acquisition and construction thereof, the cost of acquisition of lands, rights-of-way, property  rights, easements, and interests required by the authority for acquisition and  construction, the cost of demolishing or removing any buildings or structures  on land so acquired, including the cost of acquiring any lands to which  buildings or structures may be moved, the cost of acquiring or constructing and  equipping an office of the authority, the cost of machinery, furnishings, and  equipment, financing expenses, reserves, interest prior to and during  construction and for no more than [6] six months after completion of construction,  engineering, expenses of research and development with respect to any project,  legal expenses, plans, specifications, surveys, estimates of cost and revenues,  working capital, other expenses necessary or incident to determining the  feasibility or practicability of acquiring or constructing a project,  administrative expense, and such other expense as may be necessary or incident  to the acquisition or construction of the project; e.     "Construct and construction means and includes acts of construction, reconstruction, replacement, extension, improvement, and betterment of a project; f.     "Department means the Department of Environmental Protection; g.    "Governmental agency means any municipality, county, or any agency thereof, the State Government and any instrumentality or subdivision thereof; h.    Prevailing municipal bond yield means the average estimated yield that would be offered on 20-year general obligation bonds with a composite rating of approximately A as reflected by the Bond Buyer 20-Bond Municipal Bond Index during the first week of the last month of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the rent, fee, or charge was due; provided however, that, if the authority determines that the average estimated yield decreases by more than one percentage point from the yield previously determined, the authority shall redetermine the prevailing municipal bond yield to be that average estimated yield for subsequent calendar quarters of the calendar year in which rents, fees, or charges become due. [h.] i.  "Project means a water system or any part thereof; [i.] j.  "Real property means lands both within or without the State, and improvements thereof or thereon, or any rights or interests therein; [j.] k.  "Revenue" means all rents, fees, and charges for water sold from, or for the use and services of any project of the authority and payments in respect of any loans or advances made to governmental agencies pursuant to [this act] P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.); [k.] l.

STATEMENT This bill modifies the interest rates and provides for the deferral of interest that is permitted to accrue on unpaid water and sewer service bills issued by certain public (i.e. governmental) providers of water and sewer services as well as unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens and charges. The bill amends the sewerage authorities law, P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-1 et seq.) and the municipal and county utilities authorities law, P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-1 et seq.) to provide that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid service charges due and required to be paid to a sewerage authority or a municipal authority will be equal to the prevailing municipal bond yield, and will be assessed for each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at the end of each year, from the date the service charge was due until the date the charge is paid. The current interest rate on unpaid charges is fixed by statute at a rate of 1 1/2 percent per month, and has remained unchanged since January 1982. The bill amends the Municipal and County Sewerage Act, P.L.1991, c.53 (C.40A:26A-1 et seq.) and the County and Municipal Water Supply Act, P.L.1989, c.109 (C.40A:31-1 et seq.) to provide that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid rates, rentals, connection fees, or other charges due and required to be paid to a local unit or units operating a county or municipal sewerage facility or a county or municipal water supply will be equal to the prevailing municipal bond yield, and will be assessed for each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at the end of each year, from the date the payment was due until the date the payment is made.  The current interest rate on unpaid rates, rentals, connection fees, or other charges is set by statute at a rate that is at least equal to the monthly index for the immediately preceding month for 20-year tax exempt bond yields as compiled by the Bond Buyer or any similar index, and has remained unchanged since the laws were enacted in 1992 and 1989, respectively. The bill amends a section of the laws concerning real property taxation, R.S.54:4-67, to provide that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens or charges due to the governing body of a municipality will not exceed three percentage points above the prime rate, and will be assessed for each month or fraction thereof, based upon a 360 day calendar year, from the date the tax was payable until the date payment is made.  The current interest rate on unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens or charges is fixed by statute at a rate that cannot exceed 8 percent per annum on the first $1,500 of the delinquency and that cannot exceed 18 percent per annum on any amount in excess of $1,500, and has remained unchanged since 1979. The bill amends various sections of the laws concerning municipally owned sewer and water utilities, including section 1 of P.L.1952, c.324 (C.40:62-83.1), R.S.40:62-107, R.S.40:62-107.6, R.S.40:62-141, and R.S.40:62-142, to stipulate the rates of interest and penalties due on rents, rates, and other service charges required to be paid to municipalities or a water or sewerage commission of a municipality. Under the bill, interest and penalties will be charged and assessed as permitted for unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens or charges in accordance with R.S.54:4-10 67. The bill supplements the New Jersey Water Supply Authority Act, P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.) to establish that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid rents, fees, and charges required to be paid to the authority for water sold from, or for the use of services of, a water system project will be equal to the prevailing municipal bond yield, and will be assessed for each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at the end of each year, from the date the bill is originally payable until the actual date of payment.  Currently, interest accrues on unpaid rents, fees, and charges at two separate rates set by regulations: the authority charges interest on unpaid payments related to the sale of water from the Raritan Basin System at a rate tied to the interest rate accruing on the authoritys short-term deposits and charges interest on unpaid payments related to the sale of water from the Manasquan Reservoir Water Supply System at a rate that cannot exceed 18 percent per annum. The bill defines prevailing municipal bond yield as the average estimated yield that would be offered on 20-year general obligation bonds with a composite rating of approximately A as reflected by the Bond Buyer 20-Bond Municipal Bond Index during the first week of the last month of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the rates, rents, or sewer and water services charges were due or otherwise required to be paid.  During the first week of December 2014, the average estimated yield offered on 20-year general obligation bonds with a composite rating of approximately A was 3.83 percent; during the first week of December 2015 that yield was 3.57 percent. The bill defines "prime rate" as that term is defined by the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et seq., and as is determined and redetermined by Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury for purposes of setting and assessing interest due and required to be paid in connection with a delinquent or deficient payment of a State tax pursuant to R.S.54:49-3 or R.S.54:49-6, respectively. During the first week of December 2014, the prime rate as determined by the Director of the Division of Taxation for purposes of setting and assessing interest was 3.25 percent; during the first week of December 2015 that rate was 3.25 percent. In addition, the bill amends the sewerage authorities law, P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-1 et seq.) and the municipal and county utilities authorities law, P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-1 et seq.), and supplements the New Jersey Water Supply Authority Act, P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.), to specify the period of time required to elapse before interest accrues on unpaid utility bills issued by those providers of services. The bill requires at least 30 days to elapse following the date the payment or charge is originally due before interest on the unpaid balance is permitted to accrue. The bill takes effect immediately and applies to all charges, rates, rents, fees, and payments and all municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens and charges that become due or otherwise are first required to be paid on or after the first day of the first fiscal year, of the sewerage authority, municipal authority, governing body or bodies of a local unit or unity, municipality, or authority to which the charge, rate, rent, fee, municipal tax, assessment, or other municipal lien or charge is due or otherwise required to be paid, beginning at least 120 days after the date of enactment. The purpose of this bill is to provide a more standard, consistent approach to setting and assessing interest rates on unpaid water and sewer service bills issued by certain providers of water and sewer services as well as unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens and charges that allows interest rates to rise and fall based on prevailing rates in the current marketplace.

(cf: P.L.2002, c.42, s.4) 2.    Section 21 of P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-21) is amended to read as follows: 21.  (a)  In the event that a service charge of any sewerage authority with regard to any parcel of real property shall not be paid as and when due and remains unpaid for 30 days following the date for the payment thereof, interest shall accrue and be due to the sewerage authority on the unpaid balance at [the] a rate [of 1 1/2 % per month] equal to the prevailing municipal bond yield assessed for each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at the end of each year, from the date the service charge was originally due until [such] the date the service charge, and the interest thereon, shall be fully paid to the sewerage authority. (b)   In the event that a service charge of any sewerage authority with regard to any parcel of real property owned by any person other than the State or an agency or subdivision thereof shall not be paid as and when due, the unpaid balance thereof and all interest accruing thereon shall be a lien on such parcel.  Such lien shall be superior and paramount to the interest in such parcel of any owner, lessee, tenant, mortgagee, or other person except the lien of municipal taxes and shall be on a parity with and deemed equal to the lien on such parcel of the municipality where such parcel is situate for taxes thereon due in the same year and not paid when due.  Such lien shall not bind or affect a subsequent bona fide purchaser of such parcel for a valuable  consideration without actual notice of such lien, unless the sewerage authority  shall have filed in the office of the collector or other officer of [said] that municipality charged with the duty of enforcing municipal liens on real property a statement showing the amount and due date of such unpaid balance and  identifying such parcel, which identification may be sufficiently made by reference to the assessment map of [said] that municipality. The information shown in such statement shall be included in any certificate with respect to [said] that parcel thereafter made by the official of [said] that municipality vested with the power to make official certificates of searches for municipal liens.  Whenever such service charge and any subsequent service charge with regard to such parcel and all interest accrued thereon shall have been fully paid to the sewerage authority, such statement shall be promptly withdrawn or cancelled by the sewerage authority. (c)   In the event that a service charge of any sewerage authority with regard to any parcel of real property shall not be paid as and when due, the sewerage authority may, in its discretion, enter upon such parcel and cause the connection thereof leading directly or indirectly to the sewerage system to be cut and shut off until such service charge and any subsequent service charge with regard to such parcel and all interest accrued thereon shall be fully paid to the sewerage authority. (d)   In the event that a service charge of any sewerage authority with regard to any parcel of real property shall not be paid as and when due, the sewerage authority may, in accordance with section [twenty-six] 26 of [this act] P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-26), cause the supply of water to such parcel to be stopped or restricted until such service charge and any subsequent service charge with regard to such parcel and all interest accrued thereon shall be fully paid to the sewerage authority.  If for any [any] reason such supply of water shall not be promptly stopped or restricted  as required by section [twenty-six] 26 of [this act] P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-26), the sewerage authority may itself shut off or restrict such supply and, for that purpose, may enter on any lands, waters, or premises of any county, municipality, or other person.  The supply of water to such parcel shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, be restored or increased if the [State] Department of Health, upon application of the local board of health or health officer of the municipality where such parcel is situate, shall after public hearing find and shall certify to the sewerage authority that the continuance of such stopping or restriction of the supply of water endangers the health of the public in such municipality. (e)   The collector or other officer of every municipality charged by law with the duty of enforcing municipal liens on real property shall enforce, with and  as any other municipal lien on real property in such municipality, all service  charges and the lien thereof shown in any statement filed with him by any  sewerage authority pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and shall pay over to the sewerage authority the sums or a pro rata share of the sums realized upon such enforcement or upon liquidation of any property acquired by  the municipality by virtue of such enforcement. (f)   In the event that any service charge of a sewerage authority shall not be paid as and when due, the unpaid balance thereof and all interest accrued thereon, together with attorney's fees and costs, may be recovered by the sewerage authority in a civil action, and any lien on real property for such service charge and interest accrued thereon may be foreclosed or otherwise enforced by the sewerage authority by action or suit in equity as for the foreclosure of a mortgage on such real property.

The lien shall have priority over all other liens theretofore or thereafter attaching, except those for federal, State, and local taxes. (cf: N.J.S.40A:31-20) 17.  R.S.54:4-67 is amended to read as follows: 54:4-67. a. (1) The governing body of each municipality may by resolution fix the rate of discount to be allowed for the payment of taxes or assessments previous to the date on which they would become delinquent.  The rate so fixed shall not exceed 6% per annum, shall be allowed only in case of payment made on or before the thirtieth day previous to the date on which the taxes or assessments would become delinquent, after subtracting the amount of applicable property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6).  No such discount shall apply to the purchaser of a total property tax levy pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1997, c.99 (C.54:5-113.5).  The governing body may also fix the rate of interest to be charged for the nonpayment of taxes, assessments, or other municipal liens or charges, unless otherwise provided by law, on or before the date when they would become delinquent, and [may] shall provide that no interest shall be charged if payment of any installment is made within the tenth calendar day following the date upon which the same became payable.  The rate so fixed shall not exceed [8% per annum on the first $1,500.00 of the delinquency and 18% per annum on any amount in excess of $1,500.00, to be calculated] three percentage points above the prime rate, and shall be assessed for each month or fraction thereof, based upon a 360 day calendar year, from the date the tax was payable until the date that actual payment to the tax collector is made. (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection regarding delinquent payments, in the case of a municipality that has experienced a flood, hurricane, superstorm, tornado, or other natural disaster, interest shall not be charged by the municipality to a delinquent taxpayer if: (a)   a state of emergency has been declared as a result thereof by the Governor less than 30 days prior to the date upon which a property tax installment payment is payable pursuant to R.S.54:4-66 or section 2 of P.L.1994, c.72 (C.54:4-66.1), as appropriate, and (b)   the governing body of the municipality adopts a resolution providing that interest shall not be charged to a delinquent taxpayer if payment of the property tax installment, plus any available property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), is made on or before the first day of the next calendar month from the date upon which it became payable. (3)   The municipal clerk shall notify the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs of its adoption of a resolution effectuating the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection not later than the third business day next following the municipal governing body's adoption of the resolution.  If the municipality is under State supervision pursuant to the provisions of Article 4 of the "Local Government Supervision Act (1947)," P.L.1947, c.151 (C.52:27BB-54 et seq.), is subject to the provisions of the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act," P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.), or is otherwise subject to a memorandum of understanding or similar agreement with the division as a condition of receiving supplemental State aid, the resolution shall not be effective unless it is approved by the director. (4)   (a) As used in this paragraph: "Eligible resident" means either: (i)    an employee of a federal government agency who is furloughed because of a shutdown and receives unemployment benefits during the shutdown or who works during a shutdown but is not paid because of the shutdown; or (ii)   a contractor whose pay is received through a contract with a federal government agency but whose payment is delayed or diminished because of a shutdown, provided that the contractor receives unemployment benefits during the shutdown. "Shutdown" means any period in which there is more than a 24-hour lapse in appropriations for any federal government agency as a result of a failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution due to an impasse between the President and the Congress of the United States or between the two Houses of Congress. (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection regarding delinquent payments, a municipality shall not charge interest to a delinquent taxpayer who is an eligible resident or who resides with a spouse, partner in a civil union, or domestic partner who is an eligible resident, if: (i)    a shutdown remains in effect for more than 21 days and either ends less than 14 days prior to the date upon which a property tax installment payment is payable pursuant to R.S.54:4-66 or section 2 of P.L.1994, c.72 (C.54:4-66.1), as appropriate, or remains in effect on the date that the property tax installment payment is due and payable; and (ii)   the governing body of the municipality in which the delinquent taxpayer resides adopts a resolution providing that interest shall not be charged to such a delinquent taxpayer if payment of the property tax installment, less any available property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), is made on or before the date upon which the next property tax installment payment is payable. (c)   Interest shall not be charged pursuant to this paragraph only if a delinquent property taxpayer provides to the municipality proof that the delinquent property taxpayer's pay, or the pay of the delinquent property taxpayer's spouse, partner in a civil union, or domestic partner, is derived from a federal government agency that is affected by a shutdown.  In the case of a federal employee, that proof shall be demonstrated by a pay stub showing employment by a federal government agency that is affected by a shutdown.  In the case of a contractor, the resolution adopted by the governing body of the municipality pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this paragraph shall establish the criteria necessary to verify the that the contractor's pay is received through a contract with a federal agency that is affected by a shutdown. (d)   The municipal clerk shall notify the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs of the municipality's adoption of a resolution effectuating the provisions of part (ii) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph not later than the third business day next following the adoption of the resolution.  If the municipality is under State supervision pursuant to the provisions of Article 4 of the "Local Government Supervision Act (1947)," P.L.1947, c.151 (C.52:27BB-54 et seq.), is subject to the provisions of the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act," P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.), or is otherwise subject to a memorandum of understanding or similar agreement with the division as a condition of receiving supplemental State aid, the resolution shall not be effective unless it is approved by the director. b.    At any time when the governing body changes the rate of interest to be charged for delinquent taxes, assessments, or other municipal charges, or to be charged for the end of the year penalty, pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the governing body, after adoption of a resolution changing the rate of interest, shall provide a notice to all taxpayers, prior to the date that taxes are next due or with the tax bill, stating the new rate or rates to be charged, the date that the new rate or rates take effect, and, if the new rate or rates of interest are not to be effective for the remainder of the tax year, the property tax quarter or quarters for which the change in rates shall apply.  The notice may be separate from the tax bill.  A change in the rate of interest or the end of year penalty shall not take effect until the required notice has been provided in accordance with this subsection.  To satisfy the notice requirement in this subsection, the governing body shall post the notice on its municipal bulletin board; post the notice on its municipal Internet webpage; publish the notice in its official newspaper; provide a notice to all taxpayers by either (1) regular mail; or (2) by a telephonic system and issue the notice by one of the following alternatives: electronic mail, text messaging system, or any other digital platform used by the municipality to disseminate information to public residents electronically. c.     In municipalities that have sold their property tax levy pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1997, c.99 (C.54:5-113.5), the rate of interest to be charged for the nonpayment of taxes, assessments, or other municipal liens or charges shall be the same interest or delinquency rate or rates otherwise charged by the municipality, to be calculated from the date the tax was payable until the date of actual payment to the tax collector.  The purchaser of the total property tax levy shall be paid only those amounts attributable to properties included in the total property tax levy purchase and actually collected by the tax collector and which amounts shall not include any delinquent interest collected by the municipal tax collector prior to the time that the total property tax levy purchaser makes the levy payment to the municipality. d.    Whenever the time period for a property tax installment payment has been extended pursuant to the provisions of subsection a. of this section, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs may, by temporary order, extend the dates for payment of taxes by a municipality due to a county pursuant to R.S.54:4-74, any school district pursuant to R.S.54:4-75, and any other taxing district as provided by law. "Delinquency" means the sum of all taxes and municipal charges due on a specific real property, less the amount of applicable property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), covering any number of quarters or years.  The property shall remain delinquent, as defined herein, until such time as all unpaid taxes, including subsequent taxes and liens, together with interest thereon shall have been fully paid and satisfied and all applicable property tax credit, as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), has been credited.  The delinquency shall remain notwithstanding the issuance of a certificate of sale pursuant to R.S.54:5-32 and R.S.54:5-46, the payment of delinquent tax by the purchaser of the total property tax levy pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1997, c.99 (C.54:5-113.5) and for the purposes of satisfying the requirements for filing any tax appeal with the county board of taxation or the State tax court.  The governing body may also fix a penalty to be charged to a taxpayer with a delinquency in excess of $10,000 who fails to pay that delinquency as billed, less the amount of applicable property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), prior to the end of the fiscal year.  If any fiscal year delinquency in excess of $10,000 is paid by the holder of an outstanding tax sale certificate or a total property tax levy purchaser, the holder or purchaser, as appropriate, shall be entitled to receive the amount of the penalty as part of the amount required to redeem such certificate of sale providing the payment is made by the tax lien holder or tax levy purchaser prior to the end of the fiscal year.  If the holder of the outstanding tax sale certificate or the levy purchaser, as appropriate, does not make the payment in full prior to the end of the fiscal year, then the holder or purchaser shall be entitled to a pro rata share of the delinquency penalty upon redemption, and the balance of the penalty shall inure to the benefit of the municipality.  The penalty so fixed shall not exceed 6% of the amount of the delinquency with respect to each most recent fiscal year only. "Prime rate" means prime rate as that term is defined by R.S.54:48-2 and as is determined and redetermined by Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury for purposes of setting and assessing interest due and required to be paid in connection with a delinquent or deficient payment of a State tax pursuant to R.S.54:49-3 or R.S.54:49-6, respectively. (cf: P.L.2020, c.34, s.10) 18.  Section 3 of P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-3) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in this act: a.     "Authority means the New Jersey Water Supply Authority created by [this act] P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.); b.    "Bonds means bonds, notes, or other obligations issued or authorized pursuant to [this act] P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.); c.     "Compensating reservoir"  means the structures, facilities, and appurtenances for the impounding, transportation, and release of water for the replenishment in periods of drought or at other necessary times of all or a part of waters in or bordering the State diverted into a project; d.    "Cost"  as applied to a project means the cost of acquisition and construction thereof, the cost of acquisition of lands, rights-of-way, property  rights, easements, and interests required by the authority for acquisition and  construction, the cost of demolishing or removing any buildings or structures  on land so acquired, including the cost of acquiring any lands to which  buildings or structures may be moved, the cost of acquiring or constructing and  equipping an office of the authority, the cost of machinery, furnishings, and  equipment, financing expenses, reserves, interest prior to and during  construction and for no more than [6] six months after completion of construction,  engineering, expenses of research and development with respect to any project,  legal expenses, plans, specifications, surveys, estimates of cost and revenues,  working capital, other expenses necessary or incident to determining the  feasibility or practicability of acquiring or constructing a project,  administrative expense, and such other expense as may be necessary or incident  to the acquisition or construction of the project; e.     "Construct and construction means and includes acts of construction, reconstruction, replacement, extension, improvement, and betterment of a project; f.     "Department means the Department of Environmental Protection; g.    "Governmental agency means any municipality, county, or any agency thereof, the State Government and any instrumentality or subdivision thereof; h.    Prevailing municipal bond yield means the average estimated yield that would be offered on 20-year general obligation bonds with a composite rating of approximately A as reflected by the Bond Buyer 20-Bond Municipal Bond Index during the first week of the last month of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the rent, fee, or charge was due; provided however, that, if the authority determines that the average estimated yield decreases by more than one percentage point from the yield previously determined, the authority shall redetermine the prevailing municipal bond yield to be that average estimated yield for subsequent calendar quarters of the calendar year in which rents, fees, or charges become due. [h.] i.  "Project means a water system or any part thereof; [i.] j.  "Real property means lands both within or without the State, and improvements thereof or thereon, or any rights or interests therein; [j.] k.  "Revenue" means all rents, fees, and charges for water sold from, or for the use and services of any project of the authority and payments in respect of any loans or advances made to governmental agencies pursuant to [this act] P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.); [k.] l.

(cf: P.L.1981, c.293, s.3) 19.  (New section)  The rents, fees, and charges required to be paid to the authority in accordance with P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.) for water sold from, or for the use of services of, a water system project shall be due and required to be paid within 30 days of the billing date.  If any rent, fee, or charge required to be paid to the authority in accordance with P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.) for water sold from, or for the use of services of, a water system project is not paid within 30 days of the billing date, interest shall accrue and be due on the unpaid amount at a rate equal to the prevailing municipal bond yield assessed for each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at the end of each year, from the date the bill is originally payable until the actual date of payment. 20.  This act shall take effect immediately and apply to all charges, rates, rents, fees, and payments and all municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens and charges that become due or otherwise are first required to be paid on or after the first day of the first fiscal year, of the sewerage authority, municipal authority, governing body or bodies of a local unit or unity, municipality, or authority to which the charge, rate, rent, fee, municipal tax, assessment, or other municipal lien or charge is due or otherwise required to be paid, beginning at least 120 days after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill modifies the interest rates and provides for the deferral of interest that is permitted to accrue on unpaid water and sewer service bills issued by certain public (i.e. governmental) providers of water and sewer services as well as unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens and charges. The bill amends the sewerage authorities law, P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-1 et seq.) and the municipal and county utilities authorities law, P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-1 et seq.) to provide that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid service charges due and required to be paid to a sewerage authority or a municipal authority will be equal to the prevailing municipal bond yield, and will be assessed for each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at the end of each year, from the date the service charge was due until the date the charge is paid. The current interest rate on unpaid charges is fixed by statute at a rate of 1 1/2 percent per month, and has remained unchanged since January 1982. The bill amends the Municipal and County Sewerage Act, P.L.1991, c.53 (C.40A:26A-1 et seq.) and the County and Municipal Water Supply Act, P.L.1989, c.109 (C.40A:31-1 et seq.) to provide that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid rates, rentals, connection fees, or other charges due and required to be paid to a local unit or units operating a county or municipal sewerage facility or a county or municipal water supply will be equal to the prevailing municipal bond yield, and will be assessed for each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at the end of each year, from the date the payment was due until the date the payment is made.  The current interest rate on unpaid rates, rentals, connection fees, or other charges is set by statute at a rate that is at least equal to the monthly index for the immediately preceding month for 20-year tax exempt bond yields as compiled by the Bond Buyer or any similar index, and has remained unchanged since the laws were enacted in 1992 and 1989, respectively. The bill amends a section of the laws concerning real property taxation, R.S.54:4-67, to provide that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens or charges due to the governing body of a municipality will not exceed three percentage points above the prime rate, and will be assessed for each month or fraction thereof, based upon a 360 day calendar year, from the date the tax was payable until the date payment is made.  The current interest rate on unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens or charges is fixed by statute at a rate that cannot exceed 8 percent per annum on the first $1,500 of the delinquency and that cannot exceed 18 percent per annum on any amount in excess of $1,500, and has remained unchanged since 1979. The bill amends various sections of the laws concerning municipally owned sewer and water utilities, including section 1 of P.L.1952, c.324 (C.40:62-83.1), R.S.40:62-107, R.S.40:62-107.6, R.S.40:62-141, and R.S.40:62-142, to stipulate the rates of interest and penalties due on rents, rates, and other service charges required to be paid to municipalities or a water or sewerage commission of a municipality. Under the bill, interest and penalties will be charged and assessed as permitted for unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens or charges in accordance with R.S.54:4-10 67. The bill supplements the New Jersey Water Supply Authority Act, P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.) to establish that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid rents, fees, and charges required to be paid to the authority for water sold from, or for the use of services of, a water system project will be equal to the prevailing municipal bond yield, and will be assessed for each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at the end of each year, from the date the bill is originally payable until the actual date of payment.  Currently, interest accrues on unpaid rents, fees, and charges at two separate rates set by regulations: the authority charges interest on unpaid payments related to the sale of water from the Raritan Basin System at a rate tied to the interest rate accruing on the authoritys short-term deposits and charges interest on unpaid payments related to the sale of water from the Manasquan Reservoir Water Supply System at a rate that cannot exceed 18 percent per annum. The bill defines prevailing municipal bond yield as the average estimated yield that would be offered on 20-year general obligation bonds with a composite rating of approximately A as reflected by the Bond Buyer 20-Bond Municipal Bond Index during the first week of the last month of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the rates, rents, or sewer and water services charges were due or otherwise required to be paid.  During the first week of December 2014, the average estimated yield offered on 20-year general obligation bonds with a composite rating of approximately A was 3.83 percent; during the first week of December 2015 that yield was 3.57 percent. The bill defines "prime rate" as that term is defined by the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et seq., and as is determined and redetermined by Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury for purposes of setting and assessing interest due and required to be paid in connection with a delinquent or deficient payment of a State tax pursuant to R.S.54:49-3 or R.S.54:49-6, respectively. During the first week of December 2014, the prime rate as determined by the Director of the Division of Taxation for purposes of setting and assessing interest was 3.25 percent; during the first week of December 2015 that rate was 3.25 percent. In addition, the bill amends the sewerage authorities law, P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-1 et seq.) and the municipal and county utilities authorities law, P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-1 et seq.), and supplements the New Jersey Water Supply Authority Act, P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.), to specify the period of time required to elapse before interest accrues on unpaid utility bills issued by those providers of services. The bill requires at least 30 days to elapse following the date the payment or charge is originally due before interest on the unpaid balance is permitted to accrue. The bill takes effect immediately and applies to all charges, rates, rents, fees, and payments and all municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens and charges that become due or otherwise are first required to be paid on or after the first day of the first fiscal year, of the sewerage authority, municipal authority, governing body or bodies of a local unit or unity, municipality, or authority to which the charge, rate, rent, fee, municipal tax, assessment, or other municipal lien or charge is due or otherwise required to be paid, beginning at least 120 days after the date of enactment. The purpose of this bill is to provide a more standard, consistent approach to setting and assessing interest rates on unpaid water and sewer service bills issued by certain providers of water and sewer services as well as unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens and charges that allows interest rates to rise and fall based on prevailing rates in the current marketplace.
