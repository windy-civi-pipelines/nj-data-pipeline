<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill modifies the
interest rates and provides for the deferral of interest that is permitted to
accrue on unpaid water and sewer service bills issued by certain public (i.e.
governmental) providers of water and sewer services as well as unpaid municipal
taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens and charges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends the sewerage
authorities law, P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-1 et seq.) and the municipal and
county utilities authorities law, P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-1 et seq.) to
provide that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid service charges
due and required to be paid to a sewerage authority or a municipal authority
will be equal to the prevailing municipal bond yield, and will be assessed for
each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at the end of each year,
from the date the service charge was due until the date the charge is paid. 
The current interest rate on unpaid charges is fixed by statute at a rate of 1
1/2 percent per month, and has remained unchanged since January 1982.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends the Municipal
and County Sewerage Act, P.L.1991, c.53 (C.40A:26A-1 et seq.) and the County
and Municipal Water Supply Act, P.L.1989, c.109 (C.40A:31-1 et seq.) to
provide that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid rates, rentals,
connection fees, or other charges due and required to be paid to a local unit
or units operating a county or municipal sewerage facility or a county or
municipal water supply will be equal to the prevailing municipal bond yield,
and will be assessed for each month or fraction thereof, compounded annually at
the end of each year, from the date the payment was due until the date the
payment is made.  The current interest rate on unpaid rates, rentals,
connection fees, or other charges is set by statute at a rate that is at least
equal to the monthly index for the immediately preceding month for 20-year tax
exempt bond yields as compiled by the Bond Buyer or any similar index, and
has remained unchanged since the laws were enacted in 1992 and 1989,
respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends a section of
the laws concerning real property taxation, R.S.54:4-67, to provide that the
interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and
other municipal liens or charges due to the governing body of a municipality
will not exceed three percentage points above the prime rate, and will be
assessed for each month or fraction thereof, based upon a 360 day calendar
year, from the date the tax was payable until the date payment is made.  The
current interest rate on unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal
liens or charges is fixed by statute at a rate that cannot exceed 8 percent per
annum on the first $1,500 of the delinquency and that cannot exceed 18 percent
per annum on any amount in excess of $1,500, and has remained unchanged since
1979.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends various
sections of the laws concerning municipally owned sewer and water utilities,
including section 1 of P.L.1952, c.324 (C.40:62-83.1), R.S.40:62-107,
R.S.40:62-107.6, R.S.40:62-141, and R.S.40:62-142, to stipulate the rates of
interest and penalties due on rents, rates, and other service charges required
to be paid to municipalities or a water or sewerage commission of a
municipality. Under the bill, interest and penalties will be charged and
assessed as permitted for unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and other
municipal liens or charges in accordance with R.S.54:4-10 67.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill supplements the New
Jersey Water Supply Authority Act, P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.) to
establish that the interest rate permitted to accrue on unpaid rents, fees, and
charges required to be paid to the authority for water sold from, or for the
use of services of, a water system project will be equal to the prevailing
municipal bond yield, and will be assessed for each month or fraction thereof,
compounded annually at the end of each year, from the date the bill is
originally payable until the actual date of payment.  Currently, interest
accrues on unpaid rents, fees, and charges at two separate rates set by
regulations: the authority charges interest on unpaid payments related to the
sale of water from the Raritan Basin System at a rate tied to the interest rate
accruing on the authoritys short-term deposits and charges interest on unpaid
payments related to the sale of water from the Manasquan Reservoir Water Supply
System at a rate that cannot exceed 18 percent per annum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines prevailing
municipal bond yield as the average estimated yield that would be offered on
20-year general obligation bonds with a composite rating of approximately A
as reflected by the Bond Buyer 20-Bond Municipal Bond Index during the first
week of the last month of the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar
year in which the rates, rents, or sewer and water services charges were due or
otherwise required to be paid.  During the first week of December 2014, the
average estimated yield offered on 20-year general obligation bonds with a
composite rating of approximately A was 3.83 percent; during the first week
of December 2015 that yield was 3.57 percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines &quot;prime
rate&quot; as that term is defined by the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law,
R.S.54:48-1 et seq., and as is determined and redetermined by Director of the
Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury for purposes of setting
and assessing interest due and required to be paid in connection with a
delinquent or deficient payment of a State tax pursuant to R.S.54:49-3 or
R.S.54:49-6, respectively. During the first week of December 2014, the prime
rate as determined by the Director of the Division of Taxation for purposes of
setting and assessing interest was 3.25 percent; during the first week of
December 2015 that rate was 3.25 percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill amends
the sewerage authorities law, P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-1 et seq.) and the
municipal and county utilities authorities law, P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-1
et seq.), and supplements the New Jersey Water Supply Authority Act,
P.L.1981, c.293 (C.58:1B-1 et seq.), to specify the period of time required to
elapse before interest accrues on unpaid utility bills issued by those
providers of services. The bill requires at least 30 days to elapse following
the date the payment or charge is originally due before interest on the unpaid
balance is permitted to accrue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill takes effect
immediately and applies to all charges, rates, rents, fees, and payments and
all municipal taxes, assessments, and other municipal liens and charges that
become due or otherwise are first required to be paid on or after the first day
of the first fiscal year, of the sewerage authority, municipal authority,
governing body or bodies of a local unit or unity, municipality, or authority
to which the charge, rate, rent, fee, municipal tax, assessment, or other
municipal lien or charge is due or otherwise required to be paid, beginning at
least 120 days after the date of enactment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of this bill is to
provide a more standard, consistent approach to setting and assessing interest
rates on unpaid water and sewer service bills issued by certain providers of
water and sewer services as well as unpaid municipal taxes, assessments, and
other municipal liens and charges that allows interest rates to rise and fall
based on prevailing rates in the current marketplace. </p>
