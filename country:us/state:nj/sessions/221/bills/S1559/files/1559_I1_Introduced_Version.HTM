Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  There is established
in the Department of Education a three-year pilot program, the purpose of which
shall be to support programs to increase the length of the school day or the
school year in school districts selected for participation in the pilot
program. Under the pilot program, the Commissioner of Education shall award
funds on a competitive basis, with priority given to school districts that have
student populations demonstrating a high level of need for academic support
based on the most recently available Statewide assessment results, the
percentage of students in the district who graduate from high school, and the
percentage of students in the district who drop out of school prior to
graduation. The commissioner shall select no more than 20 school districts to
participate in the pilot program, which shall be selected in the following
manner:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) five school districts from
the southern region of the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) five school districts from
the central region of the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) five school districts from
the northern region of the State; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) five other school
districts that shall be selected by the department based on a priority ranking
of districts that have student populations demonstrating the highest level of
academic need based on the most recently available Statewide assessment results,
the percentage of students in the district who graduate from high school, and
the percentage of students in the district who drop out of school prior to graduation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A school district
seeking funds under the pilot program shall submit an application to the
commissioner. In addition to any other information the commissioner may deem
necessary, the application shall include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) a description of the need
to offer some or all students in the district a program to increase the length
of the school day or the school year and how extended learning time will
support learning acceleration;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) details concerning the
manner in which the district intends to implement its program to increase the
length of the school day or school year, including whether or not the effort to
increase the length of the school day or school year will be available to all
students and, if not, the student eligibility criteria for inclusion in the
program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) a description of how the
district has utilized funds, including federal Elementary and Secondary School
Emergency Relief Fund moneys, for learning recovery and other initiatives to
address the educational impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on students
enrolled in the district and the amount of funds, if any, that have been
dedicated to efforts to extend the length of the school day or the school year;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) a request for the amount
of funds being sought by the district under the pilot program and an
explanation of how the district plans to use grant funds in the event that it
is selected for participation;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) a description of any
additional funds, on top of those funds that may be currently utilized by the
district or that may be granted under the pilot program, that the district
plans to use to support its program to increase the length of the school day or
school year; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) documentation evidencing
that the districts plan to increase the length of the school day or the school
year, as applicable, has received input and feedback from teaching staff
members of the district and that a majority of the teaching staff members
support the plan. If available, the application shall include the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement or other contract that includes provisions for
an increase in the length of the school day or school year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)  Subject to the
provisions of subsection a. of this section, the commissioner shall select the
school districts that will receive grants under the pilot program. A school
district selected for participation in the pilot program shall be granted no
more than $1,000,000 annually throughout the duration of the pilot program. A
school district selected by the commissioner for participation shall utilize
the funds for any costs associated with the implementation of a program to
