STATEMENT This bill requires dwelling units in an age-restricted community that are transferred by resale to remain occupied by households that will allow the age-restricted community to remain "housing for older persons," as defined by the federal "Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988," 46 U.S.C. ss.3601 et seq.  This bill also clarifies the definition of "resale" in P.L.2008, c.71 to provide that resale includes mortgage and tax foreclosure sales, execution sales, and bankruptcy sales. The sponsors intend this legislation to preserve age-restricted properties' unique status by requiring that dwelling units transferred by resale, even for affordable housing purposes, continue to be occupied by older adults.
