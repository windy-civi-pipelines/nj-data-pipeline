amending P.L.1944, c.255.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 10 of P.L.1944,
c.255 (C.43:16A-10) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  (1) Upon the death of a
member in active service as a result of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   an accident met in the
actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   service in the reserve
component of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard in a
federal active duty status, and such death was not the result of the member's
willful negligence, an accidental death benefit shall be payable if a report of
the accident is filed in the office of the retirement system within 60 days
next following the accident, but the board of trustees may waive such time
limit, for a reasonable period, if in the judgment of the board the
circumstances warrant such action.  No such application shall be valid or acted
upon unless it is filed in the office of the retirement system within five
years of the date of such death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of this
subsection shall also apply to a member who is a fireman and who dies as a
result of an accident met in the actual performance of duty as a volunteer
fireman in any municipality in the State, provided the member's death was not
the result of the member's willful negligence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Upon the receipt of
proper proofs of the death of a member on account of which an accidental death
benefit is payable, there shall be paid to his widow or widower a pension of
70% of the compensation upon which contributions by the member to the annuity
savings fund were based in the last year of creditable service, <u>or of
adjusted final compensation, as appropriate,</u> or a pension of $50,000 when
death occurs on or after the effective date of P.L.2020, c.151, whichever is
greater, for the use of herself or himself and the children of the deceased
member<u>.</u> <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>;
if<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>If
there is no surviving widow or widower, 70% of such compensation or adjusted
final compensation, or a pension of $50,000, whichever is greater, shall be
paid to the members companion as defined herein. If</u> there is no surviving
widow or widower or in case the widow or widower dies <u>or if there is no
companion or in the case the companion dies</u>, 70% of such compensation<u>, or
adjusted final compensation, as the case may be,</u> will be payable to the
member's surviving child or surviving children in equal shares.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If there is no surviving
widow, widower<u>, companion,</u> or child, 25% of the compensation upon which
contributions by the member to the annuity savings fund were based in the last
year of creditable service, will be payable to one surviving dependent parent
or 40% of such compensation will be payable to two surviving parents in equal
shares.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>As used in this section,
&quot;adjusted final compensation&quot; means the amount of compensation upon
which contributions by the member to the annuity savings fund were based in the
last year of creditable service or final compensation as adjusted, as the case
may be, increased by the same percentage increase which is applied in any
adjustments of the compensation schedule of active members after the member's
death and before the date on which the deceased member of the retirement system
would have accrued 25 years of service under an assumption of continuous
service, at which time the amount resulting from such increases shall become
fixed and shall be the basis for any adjustments pursuant to the Pension
Adjustment Act, P.L.1958, c.143 (C.43:3B-1 et seq.).  Any adjustments to
compensation or adjusted final compensation shall take effect at the same time
as any adjustments in the compensation schedule of active members.  The
provisions of the Pension Adjustment Act shall not apply to any pension based
upon adjusted final compensation other than the fixed pension in effect at the
conclusion of the 25-year period.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event of accidental
death occurring in the first year of creditable service, the benefits, payable
pursuant to this subsection, shall be computed at the annual rate of
compensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If there is no surviving
widow, widower, <u>companion,</u> child or dependent parent, there shall be
paid to any other beneficiary of the deceased member, his aggregate
contributions at the time of death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   In no case shall the
death benefit provided in subsection (2) be less than that provided under
subsection (3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   In addition to the
foregoing benefits payable under subsection (2) or (3), there shall also be
paid in one sum to such beneficiary, if living, as the member shall have
nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the retirement
system, otherwise to the executor or administrator of the member's estate, an
amount equal to 3 1/2 times the compensation upon which contributions by the
member to the annuity savings fund were based in the last year of creditable
service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   In addition to the
foregoing benefits, the State shall pay to the member's employer-sponsored
health insurance program all health insurance premiums for the coverage of the
member's surviving widow or widower and dependent children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the surviving
spouse of a member of the <span class=HangingAnActChar>Police and Firemens
Retirement System of New Jersey (PFRS)</span> who died in the line of duty
receives a pension of 70 percent of the members compensation, or a minimum of
$50,000 annually, during the life of that spouse.  If there is no surviving
spouse, the pension of 70 percent of final compensation is paid to the members
surviving children.  This bill requires that the amount of the compensation be
adjusted for a period of time after the death of the member, thereby increasing
the annual pension for surviving spouses and children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The compensation will be
increased by the same percentage increase which is applied in any adjustments
of the compensation schedule of active members after the member's death and
before the date on which the deceased member of the retirement system would
have accrued 25 years of service under an assumption of continuous service.  At
25 years, the amount resulting from such increases will become fixed and be the
basis for any increases for cost of living granted thereafter.  Any adjustments
will take effect at the same time as any adjustments in the compensation
schedule of active members.  The bill provides that adjustments to PFRS
accidental death survivors pension would apply to those granted prior to effective
date of the bill but only for payments made on or after the effective date of
the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, this bill permits
that same pension of 70 percent of compensation to be paid to a companion of a
member who died in the line of duty on or after January 1, 2023.  A companion
is defined in the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill permits a companion
of a member who died before the bills effective date to file, within six
months after the bills effective date, an application for an accidental death
pension, and if approved, the pension will be made retroactive to the date of
the members death.  The companion of a member who died before the effective
date of the bill may apply for a pension only if the deceased member did not
have a surviving spouse, children, or dependent parents at the time of death,
or if the members aggregate contributions have not been paid to a beneficiary
or the estate, or have been returned to the retirement system. </p>
