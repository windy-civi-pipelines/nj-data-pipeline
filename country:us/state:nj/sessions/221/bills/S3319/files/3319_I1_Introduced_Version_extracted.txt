The personal needs allowance may vary according to the type of facility in which an eligible person resides, but in no case shall be less than [$25.00] $140.00 per month, provided that beginning January 1 of the next year following enactment of P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and annually thereafter, the minimum personal needs allowance shall be increased by the same percentage as the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits for that year. i.  Ensure that any eligible person who receives medical assistance under subparagraph (4)(a) of subsection a. or under paragraph (11), (13) or (14) of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-6) receives [$10.00] such an amount per month that, in addition to benefits received pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s. 1382(e)(1)(B), the total monthly benefit is equal to $140. If the federal government cannot administer this [$10.00] monthly increase, the commissioner shall administer this increase and shall ensure that this increase is not considered income for Supplemental Security Income program purposes. However, if the government increases the benefit level under 42 U.S.C. s. 1382(e)(1)(B), the commissioner shall allow the government to administer this increase and shall reduce its payment to an eligible recipient by an equal amount.  Beginning January 1 of the next year following enactment of P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and annually thereafter, and following the same breakdown of benefits outlined in this subsection regarding the benefits received pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s. 1382(e)(1)(B) and those additional benefits administered by the commissioner or federal government, the total monthly benefit amount shall be increased by the same percentage as the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits for that year. j.  Assess welfare boards at the beginning of each fiscal year in the same proportion that the counties currently participate in the federal categorical assistance programs, in order to obtain the amount of each county's share of supplementary payments for eligible persons in this State, based upon the number of eligible persons in the county. (cf: P.L.1991, c.466, s.1) 3.  The Commissioner of Human Services shall apply for such State plan amendments or waivers as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act and to continue to secure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program. 4.  The Commissioner of Human Services, pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act,  P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et.seq.), shall adopt such rules and regulations necessary to implement the requirements pursuant to this act. 5.  This act shall take effect immediately, except that sections 1 and 2 of this act shall be inoperative until the Commissioner of Human Services receives any necessary approval from the federal government for implementation. STATEMENT This bill increases the monthly personal needs allowance (PNA), from the current rate of $50, pursuant to the FY 2024 Appropriations Act, to $140 for residents of nursing homes, State and county psychiatric hospitals, and State developmental centers. This allowance is intended for residents to spend at their discretion on items such as telephone expenses, a meal out with friends, cards to send to family, reading materials, or hobbies. The PNA provides residents the opportunity to participate in activities beyond those provided by the facility, to remain connected with family and friends, and to obtain basic items such as clothing and shoes. The bill also stipulates that beginning January 1 of the following year after the bills enactment, the PNA is to be increased annually by the same percentage as the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits for that year. In the case of residents eligible to receive SSI public assistance, a federal income supplement program designed to help aged, blind, and disabled people with little to no income, the federal government provides up to $30 a month for small comfort items not provided by the facility.  The State currently supplements the federal allowance by $20 to ensure that SSI recipients residing in nursing facilities, State and county psychiatric hospitals, and State developmental centers receive a total PNA per month equal to that of Medicaid recipients, or $50.  Under the bill, absent any changes in the federal allowance, the State would be responsible for a $90 per month supplemental payment for each SSI recipient.
