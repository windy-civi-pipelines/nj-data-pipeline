amending P.L.2024, c.2, and repealing section 2 of P.L.1985, c.222
(C.52:27D-302).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section)  The
Legislature finds that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  The constitutional
requirements of the Mount Laurel doctrine are not static, but have changed as
the doctrine has evolved. In 1975, in Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount
Laurel, 67 N.J. 151 (1975) (Mount Laurel I), the Supreme Court imposed the
affordable housing obligation only upon &quot;developing municipalities.&quot;  In
1983, in Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 92 N.J. 158 (Mount
Laurel II), the Supreme Court found good faith efforts to be insufficient, and
instead required the determination of the satisfaction of an affordable housing
obligation on an objective basis.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  By requiring a
determination on an objective basis, most notably with respect to the fair share
obligation determination, the court in Mount Laurel II expressed an aspiration
to achieve modest changes in how municipalities planned and zoned, and to &quot;reassure
all concerned that Mount Laurel is not designed to sweep away all land use
restrictions or leave our open spaces and natural resources prey to speculators.
. . . But there will be some change, as there must be if the constitutional
rights of our lower income citizens are ever to be protected.  That change will
be much less painful for us than the status quo has been for them.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Mount Laurel II, however, resulted
in standards that amounted to far more than &quot;some change.&quot;  The
standards the Supreme Court established in Mount Laurel II precipitated a flood
of builders remedy lawsuits that severely eroded the home rule power of
municipalities, led to the assignment of extremely high fair share obligations,
and proved to be very costly to municipalities.  The burdens unleashed by Mount
Laurel II proved to be so great as to create a powerful movement for a
constitutional amendment to remove the courts altogether from imposing fair
share obligations on municipalities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  The pressures created by
the implementation of Mount Laurel II culminated in the enactment of the &quot;Fair
Housing Act,&quot; (FHA) P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), in 1985,
through which the Legislature sought to: suppress the builders remedy to the
maximum extent possible; establish &quot;reasonable fair share housing
guidelines&quot;; and reduce the costs to municipalities of litigating Mount
Laurel issues and complying with the Mount Laurel doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  In calling for the
creation of &quot;reasonable&quot; fair share standards, the Chairman on the ad
hoc Committee on Fair Housing recognized, during a September 17, 1984 hearing
on the subject, &quot;that the sum of the parts need not equal the whole.&quot; 
In other words, in enacting the FHA in 1985 and earning the praise of the
Supreme Court in so doing, the Legislature asserted that the New Jersey Constitution
does not require the obligations of each municipality to add up to the entire regional
need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  The FHA created the New
Jersey Council on Affordable Housing (council), gave the council primary
jurisdiction; and charged the council with the responsibility of adopting
regulations to implement the policies the Legislature established.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  In Hills Dev. Co. v. Twp.
Of Bernards, 103 N.J. 1 (1986) (Mount Laurel III), the Supreme Court
enthusiastically declared the FHA constitutional and noted that &quot;deference
to these legislative and executive initiatives can be regarded as a clear
signal of . . . readiness to defer further to more substantial actions.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  The council adopted
regulations to implement the FHA in 1986 for the period commonly referred to as
the &quot;first round,&quot; and again adopted regulations in 1994 for the &quot;second
round.&quot;  The regulations for both rounds largely survived challenge.  However,
when the council adopted regulations for the third round, the Appellate
Division invalidated the regulations primarily because the regulations required
the fair share to be determined through a &quot;growth share&quot; approach.  The
Court concluded that the FHA, as written at the time, did not authorize a
growth share approach.  The Supreme Court agreed, affirming the Appellate
Divisions decision in In re Adoption of N.J.A.C.5:96, 215 N.J. 578 (2013).  The
council then proposed regulations for the third round again, consistent with
the Supreme Courts requirement that the growth share approach, but ultimately
failed to adopt those regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.  Because the FHA permitted
the council to only certify housing elements and fair share plans of municipalities
that have complied with the councils rules, which were under continuous and
vigorous attack, the councils ability to process petitions by municipalities
for approval of their affordable housing plans was severely impaired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.  The councils failure to
adopt regulations satisfactory to the Supreme Court culminated in In re N.J.A.C.5:96
&amp; 5:97, 221 N.J. 1 (2015), commonly referred to as &quot;Mount Laurel IV,&quot;
wherein the court transferred the tasks from the council back to the courts for:
(1) the establishment of standards consistent with the FHA; and (2) the processing
of applications for the approval of housing elements and fair share plans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.  Although the Supreme Court
brought the task of implementing the Mount Laurel doctrine back to the courts
in Mount Laurel IV, the court concluded its opinion by asserting that it preferred
an administrative solution to a litigated one for implementing the doctrine.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.  The imposition of a
constitutional obligation on municipalities to create a realistic opportunity
to satisfy their fair share obligations presumed that the obligations imposed
were grounded in reality.  The Legislature, in both the initial 1985 enactment
of the FHA and with the 2024 revisions, required the &quot;prospective need&quot;
calculation, as provided in subsection j. of section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222
(C.52:27D-304), to be based on the &quot;development and growth which is
reasonably likely to occur,&quot; not on an obligation untethered from reality.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.  The interests of the public
at large, and of low- and moderate-income households in particular, are not
advanced by the imposition of unrealistic fair share obligations, or by forcing
municipalities to suffer the loss of their home rule powers if they fail to
comply with unrealistic obligations.  Rather, the obligations must be rooted in
reality to be achievable and to constitute sound public policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.  Establishing standards
rooted in reality merely requires fidelity to the principle embodied in the FHA,
which has remained through the revisions of the law, that the prospective need should
be based on development and growth that is reasonably likely to occur.  The
development and growth which is reasonably likely to occur is best measured by
the number of certified residential housing units created, as determined by the
data assembled by the department, after excluding new residential units that
replace demolished residential units.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     o.  In the March 8, 2018
decision of the Superior Court, Law Division, Mercer County, In re Application
of Municipality of Princeton, by which the 2024 FHA amendments were informed, the
court admitted into evidence an expert report that provided an objective basis
for estimating the number of affordable units that could be reasonably created
through development and growth that is reasonably likely to occur.  It is
therefore possible to determine the number of affordable units that are realistic
based upon the development and growth reasonably likely to occur.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     p.  In Mount Laurel II, the
Supreme Court suggested that developers who previously wanted to build
inclusionary projects found it &quot;governmentally impossible.&quot;  In stark
contrast, there is a glut of inclusionary zoning provided in the 354
municipalities that complied in the third round.  Considering that the
realities of today are extremely different than the realities of 1983, over 40
years ago, when the Supreme Court decided Mount Laurel II, the time has come
for the doctrine to continue to evolve so that it is based on these present
realities, and not those of 1983.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     q.  In Mount Laurel II, the
Supreme Court stated that, &quot;[t]he lessons of history are clear, even if rarely
learned.&quot;  Now is the time to learn from over four decades of
implementation of the Mount Laurel doctrine.  The Legislature can and should revise
the doctrines implementation to benefit from what has been learned in the past
to make it more effective and to prevent the doctrine from becoming so onerous that
it crumbles under its own weight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     r.  Towards that end, a
standard that better measures &quot;development and growth which is reasonably
likely to occur&quot; not only more faithfully implements the long-standing
definition of the &quot;prospective need,&quot; but also creates more
reasonable and achievable targets for municipalities, thereby advancing a goal
of all three branches of government: voluntary municipal compliance.</p>
