<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires Medicaid
coverage for community violence prevention services to an individual who has: 
1) received medical treatment for an injury sustained as a result of an act of
community violence, and 2) been referred by a certified or licensed health care
provider or social services provider to receive community violence prevention
services from a certified violence prevention professional, after such provider
determines such beneficiary to be at elevated risk of a violent injury or
retaliation resulting from another act of community violence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also requires that
Department of Health, within six months of the effective date of the bill, to
approve at least one accredited training and certification program for
certified violence prevention professionals.  A program approved by the
department is to include: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1) At least 35 hours of
initial training, collectively addressing all of the following:  the effects of
trauma and violence and the basics of trauma-informed care; community violence
prevention strategies, including, but not limited to, conflict mediation and
retaliation prevention related to community violence; case management and
advocacy practices; and patient privacy and the federal Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, <br>
P.L. 104-191; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    At least six hours of continuing
education every two years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any entity that employs or
contracts with a certified violence prevention professional to provide
community violence prevention services will be required to: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    maintain documentation
that the certified violence prevention professional has completed a training
and certification program approved by the department; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    ensure that the
certified violence prevention professional is providing community violence
prevention services in compliance with any applicable standards of care, rules,
regulations, and governing law of the State or federal government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No person, unless certified as
a violence prevention professional pursuant to the bill, may use the title
&quot;certified violence prevention professional&quot; or make use of any
title, words, letters, abbreviations, or insignia indicating or implying that
the person is a certified violence prevention professional.  Furthermore,
nothing in the bill is to be construed to alter the scope of practice for any
health care professional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill,
&quot;community violence prevention services&quot; means evidence-based,
trauma-informed, supportive and non-psychotherapeutic services provided by a
certified violence prevention professional, within or outside of a clinical
setting, for the purpose of promoting improved health outcomes and positive
behavioral change, preventing injury recidivism, and reducing the likelihood
that individuals who are victims of community violence will commit or promote
violence themselves.  &quot;Community violence prevention services&quot; may
include the provision of peer support and counseling, mentorship, conflict
mediation, crisis intervention, targeted case management, referrals to
certified or licensed health care professionals or social services providers, patient
education, or screening services to victims of community violence. 
Additionally, &quot;community violence&quot; is defined to mean any intentional
act of physical force against one or more other persons by an individual or
small group of individuals committed in one or more public areas, where no
actor is a family member or intimate partner of any victim.</p>
