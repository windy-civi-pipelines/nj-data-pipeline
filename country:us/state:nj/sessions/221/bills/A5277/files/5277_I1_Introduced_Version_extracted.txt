Therefore, there is a compelling public need to establish a comprehensive public awareness campaign to educate residents about available property tax relief programs, their eligibility requirements, and application processes. c. Real-time assistance through a dedicated call center is essential to help residents navigate the application process and resolve issues related to their property tax relief applications. d. The implementation of this act will enhance transparency, accessibility, and efficiency in the administration of property tax relief programs. 2.
