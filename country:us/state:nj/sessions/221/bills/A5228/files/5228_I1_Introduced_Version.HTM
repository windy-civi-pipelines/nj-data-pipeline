STATEMENT This bill amends the Earn Your Way Out Act, P.L.2019, c.364, to exclude inmates with prior convictions for indictable offenses and inmates serving sentences for certain enumerated crimes from being eligible for administrative parole release.  The Earn Your Way Out Act established a process by which an inmate who is eligible for administrative parole release may be paroled without a hearing at the time of their first eligibility for parole. Under current law, administrative parole release is available for all inmates regardless of their prior record, except for inmates previously convicted of or currently serving sentences for crimes enumerated under the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A.2C:43-7.2, the Graves Act, N.J.S.A.2C:43-6, Megans Law, N.J.S.A.2C:7-2, and the Sexually Violent Predator Act, N.J.S.A.30:4-27.26. Under the bill, inmates with any prior convictions for an indictable offense would not be eligible for administrative parole release.  Furthermore, in addition to the crimes enumerated under NERA, the Graves Act, Megans Law, and the Sexually Violent Predator Act, inmates currently serving a sentence imposed for a conviction of any of the following additional crimes would also not be eligible for administrative parole release: · Leaving the scene of an automobile accident resulting in death; · Leaving the scene of a boating accident resulting in death; · Vehicular homicide; · Assault in the third or fourth degree; · Leaving the scene of an automobile accident resulting in serious bodily injury; · Terroristic threats; · Stalking; · Criminal restraint; · Luring of an adult; · Human trafficking in the first degree; · Human trafficking in the second degree; · Invasion of privacy; · Sexual extortion; · Bias intimidation; · Aggravated arson; · Money laundering; · Endangering the welfare of a child causing abuse or neglect; · Child pornography; · Witness tampering; · Official misconduct; · False public alarm in the first degree; · False public alarm in the second degree; · Leader of a narcotics trafficking network; · Maintaining or operating a controlled substance production facility; · Manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing controlled substances; · Soliciting or providing material support for terrorism; · Prohibited weapons and devices; · Possession of explosives for an unlawful purpose; · Possession of destructive devices for an unlawful purpose; · Possession of a weapon except a firearm for an unlawful purpose; · Possession of a weapon during the commission of a drug offense; · Violation of a prohibition on weapons possession; · Manufacture, transport, disposition, and defacement of machine guns or sawed-off shotguns; · Leader of a firearms trafficking network; and · Causing death or injury while driving with a suspended license.
