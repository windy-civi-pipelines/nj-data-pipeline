If you are opposed thereto make a cross (X), plus (+) or check (a) in the square opposite the word "No." b.  In every municipality the following question: CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT REQUIRING PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION FOR SURVIVING SPOUSE OF CERTAIN FIRST RESPONDERS YES Do you approve amending the State Constitution to provide a property tax exemption for a primary residence owned and occupied by the surviving spouse of a first responder who dies as a direct result of performing regular or assigned duties? The property is required to have been the primary residence of the first responder at the time of their death. A surviving spouse who remarries would no longer receive the exemption. A surviving spouse would not qualify for the exemption if the spouse did not live with the first responder prior to the first responders death under circumstances which would have resulted in a divorce. INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This proposed constitutional amendment would provide a property tax exemption for the primary residence of the surviving spouse of a first responder who dies as a direct result of performing regular or assigned duties. The surviving spouse of a law enforcement officer, paid or volunteer firefighter, or paid or volunteer first aid, ambulance, or rescue squad member would receive the property tax exemption. The property must be owned and occupied by the surviving spouse.  The property must also have been the primary residence of the first responder at the time of the first responders death. A death occurring due to the first responders willful negligence would not allow a surviving spouse to qualify for the property tax exemption. A surviving spouse would lose the property tax exemption if the spouse remarries. A surviving spouse would not qualify for the property tax exemption if the spouse did not live with the first responder prior to the first responders death under circumstances which would have resulted in a divorce. STATEMENT This proposed constitutional amendment would provide a property tax exemption for the primary residence owned and occupied by the surviving spouse of a first responder who dies as a direct result of performing regular or assigned duties.  The property tax exemption would include the surviving spouses of a law enforcement officer, both paid and volunteer firefighters, and first aid, ambulance, or rescue squad members.  However, the property for which the property tax exemption is granted is required to have been the primary residence of the first responder at the time of the first responders death. A surviving spouse may receive the property tax exemption for as long as the spouse owns and occupies the home as a primary residence and does not remarry.  However, the property tax exemption would not be provided to the surviving spouse of a first responder who dies as a direct result of the first responders own willful negligence.  The property tax exemption also would not be provided to a surviving spouse who did not cohabit with the first responder at their time of death under circumstances which would have given rise to a cause of action for a divorce.
