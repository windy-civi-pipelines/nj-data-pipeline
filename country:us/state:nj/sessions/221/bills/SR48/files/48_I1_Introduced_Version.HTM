<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>A Senate
Resolution</span><span class=HangingAnActChar> </span>urging the federal
government to regularly update and revise the official poverty measure to
ensure accuracy in poverty determinations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
The official measure and methodology used by the federal government to
determine whether a family is living in poverty was originally published by the
Social Security Administration in the 1960s and has remained essentially unchanged
since that time, with only a few minor modifications having been instituted
over the nearly 50-year period since its inception; and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
Pursuant to this official poverty measure (OPM), a familys poverty status is
determined by comparing the familys pre-tax income with a poverty threshold
(variable by family size, composition, and householder age) that represents
three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, in todays prices; and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
Pre-tax income under this calculation is understood to include only cash
income, such as wages and salaries, pension or other retirement income, Social
Security and other cash government benefits, tax credits, interest, and
dividends; and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
The United States Census Bureau has employed the OPM for statistical purposes
since its initial publication, and the Office of Management and Budget, since
1978, has promoted the standardized use of the OPM by all executive departments
and agencies under the provisions of its Statistical Policy Directive No. 14;
and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
Since its initial implementation, concerns have been raised regarding the
accuracy and adequacy of the OPM in determining poverty levels, and in the
1990s, the United States Congress responded to these concerns by financing an
independent study by the National Academy of Sciences Panel on Poverty and
Family Assistance (NAS Panel) which resulted in the publication of a report
entitled, Measuring Poverty:  A New Approach; and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
In 2010, after several Census Bureau attempts to develop  an experimental
poverty measure based on the NAS Panel report, an Interagency Technical Working
Group (ITWG) comprised of representatives from the Office of Management and
Budget, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, the Council of
Economic Advisors, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and
Human Services, successfully developed a supplemental poverty measure (SPM),
based on the NAS Panels recommendations, for use in evaluating poverty levels in
conjunction with the OPM; and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
Under the SPM, a family is considered to be living in poverty if the familys
money inflows (including cash income and the value of noncash government
benefits such as housing subsidies, school lunch subsidies, low income
nutritional assistance, and low-income home energy assistance), less
non-discretionary expenses (including taxes, medical out-of-pocket expenses,
commuting costs, child support, and child care expenses) falls below the SPM
poverty threshold; and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
The SPM poverty threshold is determined by identifying the actual, present-day
costs associated with satisfaction of a familys basic needs  including food,
clothing, shelter, and utilities&nbsp;&nbsp;based&nbsp;on the location of the
familys residence and its type (i.e., whether the family home is a rental
property, a purchased property, or a home with a mortgage); and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
At the time of its implementation, the ITWG indicated that the SPM should be
considered to be a work in progress, which should be revised by the Census
Bureau over time (and preferably on an annual basis), based on new research and
data, so as to improve the geographic adjustments for price differences across
areas, and implement new methods for the estimation of expenses; and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
In contrast to the SPM, the OPM does not account for any variances in the cost
of living across states or regions or recognize the cost-of-living increases
that have taken place throughout the nation over the past 50 years; nor does it
account for a familys receipt of any noncash income or the expenditure of
family income on non-discretionary expenses or necessities other than food; and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
Although the federal government clearly recognizes the importance of making
regular revisions to the SPM, in order to reflect new data and more accurately
account for cost-of-living increases, new anti-poverty measures, and
non-discretionary expenditures, it has apparently failed to recognize the
importance of making similar updates to the OPM to ensure the continued
reliability and accuracy of this official measure in light of changing societal
circumstances; and</p>

<p class=IndentHang style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas,</span></b>
Because the OPM, and not the SPM, is universally used by federal statistical
agencies, and is often used to determine low-income eligibility for federal and
state benefits programs, it is essential that this official measure be updated
to more accurately reflect poverty levels in the nation, in full consideration
for the current high cost of living, the variances in cost of living across the
nation, the non-discretionary nature of many family expenses, and the many
forms of cash and noncash income that may be used to offset a familys
non-discretionary expenditures or otherwise satisfy the familys basic survival
needs; now, therefore,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Resolved </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate of the State of New
  Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This House urges the
Social Security Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, and the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This resolution urges the
Social Security Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, and the
United States Census Bureau in the Department of Commerce, as appropriate, to
take action to revise and regularly update the official measure and methodology
that has been used to determine poverty status in this nation since the 1960s,
in order to ensure that the measure provides an accurate indication of poverty
levels by accounting for the high cost of living and variations in cost of
living, and by reflecting the true extent and financial impact of
non-discretionary and basic survival expenditures, and cash and noncash
income.  The resolution would also urge the President and Congress of the United States to take action, as necessary, to ensure that the appropriate executive
agencies engage in the updating and revision of the official poverty measure as
described herein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The official poverty measure
(OPM) is designed to evaluate a familys poverty status by comparing the
familys pre-tax cash income with a poverty threshold (variable by family size,
composition, and householder age) that represents three times the cost of a
minimum food diet in 1963, in todays prices.  Since its initial
implementation, however, concerns have been raised regarding the accuracy and
adequacy of the OPM in determining poverty levels, and in 2010, a supplemental
poverty measure (SPM) was developed by an Interagency Technical Working Group
(ITWG) comprised of representatives from various federal agencies, for use in
evaluating poverty levels in conjunction with the OPM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The SPM determines a familys
poverty status by evaluating whether the familys money inflows (including cash
income and the value of noncash government benefits such as housing subsidies,
school lunch subsidies, low income nutritional assistance, and low-income home
energy assistance), less non-discretionary expenses (including taxes, medical
out-of-pocket expenses, commuting costs, child support, and child care
expenses), falls below the SPM poverty threshold.  The SPM poverty threshold is
determined by identifying the actual, present-day costs associated with
satisfaction of a familys basic needs  including food, clothing, shelter, and
utilities  based on the location of the familys residence and its type.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In contrast to the SPM, the
OPM does not account for any variances in the cost of living across states or
regions, or recognize the cost-of-living increases that have taken place throughout
the nation over the past 50 years; nor does it account for a familys receipt
of any noncash income or the expenditure of family income on non-discretionary
expenses or necessities other than food.  Because the OPM has remained
essentially unchanged since its initial publication in the 1960s, moreover, it
can no longer be deemed to provide an accurate indication of poverty levels in
the nation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Although the federal
government clearly recognizes the importance of making regular revisions to the
SPM, in order to reflect new data and more accurately account for
cost-of-living increases, new anti-poverty measures, and non-discretionary
expenditures, it has apparently failed to recognize the importance of making
similar updates to the OPM to ensure the continued reliability and accuracy of
this official measure in light of changing societal circumstances.  Because the
OPM is universally used by federal statistical agencies, and is often used to
determine low-income eligibility for federal and state benefits programs, it is
essential that this official measure be updated to more accurately reflect
poverty levels in the nation, in full consideration for the current high cost
of living, the variances in cost of living, the non-discretionary nature of
many family expenses, and the many forms of cash and noncash income that may be
used to offset a familys non-discretionary expenditures or otherwise satisfy
the familys basic survival needs.</p>
