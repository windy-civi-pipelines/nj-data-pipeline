SR48 SENATE RESOLUTION No. 48 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  SHIRLEY K. TURNER District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS Urges federal government to revise official poverty measure to account for high cost of living, non-discretionary expenses, and cash and noncash income. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Senate Resolution urging the federal government to regularly update and revise the official poverty measure to ensure accuracy in poverty determinations. Whereas, The official measure and methodology used by the federal government to determine whether a family is living in poverty was originally published by the Social Security Administration in the 1960s and has remained essentially unchanged since that time, with only a few minor modifications having been instituted over the nearly 50-year period since its inception; and Whereas, Pursuant to this official poverty measure (OPM), a familys poverty status is determined by comparing the familys pre-tax income with a poverty threshold (variable by family size, composition, and householder age) that represents three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, in todays prices; and Whereas, Pre-tax income under this calculation is understood to include only cash income, such as wages and salaries, pension or other retirement income, Social Security and other cash government benefits, tax credits, interest, and dividends; and Whereas, The United States Census Bureau has employed the OPM for statistical purposes since its initial publication, and the Office of Management and Budget, since 1978, has promoted the standardized use of the OPM by all executive departments and agencies under the provisions of its Statistical Policy Directive No. 14; and Whereas, Since its initial implementation, concerns have been raised regarding the accuracy and adequacy of the OPM in determining poverty levels, and in the 1990s, the United States Congress responded to these concerns by financing an independent study by the National Academy of Sciences Panel on Poverty and Family Assistance (NAS Panel) which resulted in the publication of a report entitled, Measuring Poverty:  A New Approach; and Whereas, In 2010, after several Census Bureau attempts to develop  an experimental poverty measure based on the NAS Panel report, an Interagency Technical Working Group (ITWG) comprised of representatives from the Office of Management and Budget, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau, the Council of Economic Advisors, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Health and Human Services, successfully developed a supplemental poverty measure (SPM), based on the NAS Panels recommendations, for use in evaluating poverty levels in conjunction with the OPM; and Whereas, Under the SPM, a family is considered to be living in poverty if the familys money inflows (including cash income and the value of noncash government benefits such as housing subsidies, school lunch subsidies, low income nutritional assistance, and low-income home energy assistance), less non-discretionary expenses (including taxes, medical out-of-pocket expenses, commuting costs, child support, and child care expenses) falls below the SPM poverty threshold; and Whereas, The SPM poverty threshold is determined by identifying the actual, present-day costs associated with satisfaction of a familys basic needs  including food, clothing, shelter, and utilities  based on the location of the familys residence and its type (i.e., whether the family home is a rental property, a purchased property, or a home with a mortgage); and Whereas, At the time of its implementation, the ITWG indicated that the SPM should be considered to be a work in progress, which should be revised by the Census Bureau over time (and preferably on an annual basis), based on new research and data, so as to improve the geographic adjustments for price differences across areas, and implement new methods for the estimation of expenses; and Whereas, In contrast to the SPM, the OPM does not account for any variances in the cost of living across states or regions or recognize the cost-of-living increases that have taken place throughout the nation over the past 50 years; nor does it account for a familys receipt of any noncash income or the expenditure of family income on non-discretionary expenses or necessities other than food; and Whereas, Although the federal government clearly recognizes the importance of making regular revisions to the SPM, in order to reflect new data and more accurately account for cost-of-living increases, new anti-poverty measures, and non-discretionary expenditures, it has apparently failed to recognize the importance of making similar updates to the OPM to ensure the continued reliability and accuracy of this official measure in light of changing societal circumstances; and Whereas, Because the OPM, and not the SPM, is universally used by federal statistical agencies, and is often used to determine low-income eligibility for federal and state benefits programs, it is essential that this official measure be updated to more accurately reflect poverty levels in the nation, in full consideration for the current high cost of living, the variances in cost of living across the nation, the non-discretionary nature of many family expenses, and the many forms of cash and noncash income that may be used to offset a familys non-discretionary expenditures or otherwise satisfy the familys basic survival needs; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House urges the Social Security Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, and the United States Census Bureau in the Department of Commerce, as appropriate, to take immediate action to update the official measure and methodology that has been used to determine poverty status in this nation since the 1960s, and to take appropriate action to revise this official measure on a regular basis thereafter, in order to ensure that the measure provides an accurate indication of poverty levels in the nation by accounting for the high cost of living and variations in cost of living, and by reflecting the true extent and financial impact of non-discretionary and basic survival expenditures and cash and noncash income. 2.    This House further urges the President and Congress of the United States to take action, as necessary, to ensure that the appropriate executive departments and agencies engage in the updating and revision of the official poverty measure in the manner described by section 1 of this resolution. 3.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the United States Census Bureau in the Department of Commerce, the President and Vice President of the United States, the Majority and Minority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and each member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution urges the Social Security Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, and the United States Census Bureau in the Department of Commerce, as appropriate, to take action to revise and regularly update the official measure and methodology that has been used to determine poverty status in this nation since the 1960s, in order to ensure that the measure provides an accurate indication of poverty levels by accounting for the high cost of living and variations in cost of living, and by reflecting the true extent and financial impact of non-discretionary and basic survival expenditures, and cash and noncash income.  The resolution would also urge the President and Congress of the United States to take action, as necessary, to ensure that the appropriate executive agencies engage in the updating and revision of the official poverty measure as described herein. The official poverty measure (OPM) is designed to evaluate a familys poverty status by comparing the familys pre-tax cash income with a poverty threshold (variable by family size, composition, and householder age) that represents three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, in todays prices.  Since its initial implementation, however, concerns have been raised regarding the accuracy and adequacy of the OPM in determining poverty levels, and in 2010, a supplemental poverty measure (SPM) was developed by an Interagency Technical Working Group (ITWG) comprised of representatives from various federal agencies, for use in evaluating poverty levels in conjunction with the OPM.
