<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 36 of P.L.1999,
c.23 (C.48:3-85) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     36.  a. Notwithstanding any
provisions of the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410
(C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the board, in consultation with the
Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety, shall
initiate a proceeding and shall adopt, after notice, provision of the
opportunity for comment, and public hearing, interim consumer protection
standards for electric power suppliers or gas suppliers, within 90 days of
February 9, 1999, including, but not limited to, standards for collections,
credit, contracts, and authorized changes of an energy customer's electric
power supplier or gas supplier, for the prohibition of discriminatory
marketing, for advertising and for disclosure.&nbsp; The standards shall be
effective as regulations immediately upon filing with the Office of
Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months,
and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted, or readopted by the board in
accordance with the provisions of the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot;
P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   (a) An electric power
supplier or gas supplier shall not provide electric generation service or gas
supply service to a customer in this State unless the electric power supplier
or gas supplier has provided the customer a one-page information sheet
summarizing the material terms and conditions of the contract as determined by
the board.&nbsp; Contract standards shall include, but not be limited to,
requirements that electric power supply contracts or gas supply contracts
conspicuously disclose the duration of the contract; state the price per
kilowatt hour or per therm or other pricing determinant approved by the board;
use a 12-point font; provide a one-page information sheet in a 12-point font
summarizing the material terms and conditions of the contract in English and
Spanish, as determined by the board; provide the phone number and website for
filing complaints with the Board of Public Utilities, Division of Customer Assistance,
and a one sentence explanation of the practice known as slamming, which is an
unauthorized change of a customer's electric power supplier or gas supplier, in
a 12-point, boldface font on the one-page information sheet; and state, in a
12-point, boldface font, whether the contract is for a fixed rate or a variable
rate, and provide a brief explanation of the difference between a fixed rate
and a variable rate that is easily understandable by the general public,
including an explanation on how weather fluctuations may affect the price of
variable rate contracts; have the customer's written signature or electronic
signature; an audio recording of a telephone call initiated by the customer;
independent, third-party verification, in accordance with section 37 of
P.L.1999,&nbsp;c.23 (C.48:3-86), of a telephone call initiated by an electric
power supplier, gas supplier, or private aggregator; or any alternative forms
of verification as the board, in consultation with the Division of Consumer
Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety, may permit<b><sup> </sup></b>prior
to switching electric power suppliers or gas suppliers and for contract
renewal; and include termination procedures, notice of any fees, and toll-free
or local telephone numbers for the electric power supplier or gas supplier and
for the board.&nbsp; An electric power supplier or gas supplier shall not
provide the customer's telephone number, electronic mail address, or postal
address to other electric power suppliers or gas suppliers if the customer's telephone
number appears on the no telemarketing call list established and maintained by
the Division of Consumer Affairs, pursuant to the provisions of section 9 of
P.L.2003, c.76 (C.56:8-127), or the national do-not-call registry as maintained
by the Federal Trade Commission. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   As used in this
paragraph, &quot;customer&quot; means a residential customer or a commercial
electric customer with a cumulative peak load of 50 kilowatts or less, or a
commercial gas customer with a cumulative peak load of 5,000 therms or less.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Standards for the
prohibition of discriminatory marketing shall provide, at a minimum, that a
decision made by an electric power supplier or a gas supplier to accept or
reject a customer shall not be based on race, color, national origin, age,
gender, religion, source of income, receipt of public benefits, family status,
sexual preference, or geographic location.&nbsp; The board shall adopt
reporting requirements to monitor compliance with its standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Advertising standards
for electric power suppliers or gas suppliers shall provide, at a minimum, that
optional charges to the customer will not be added to any advertised cost per
kilowatt hour or per therm, and that the only unit of measurement that may be
used in advertisements is cost per kilowatt hour or per therm, unless otherwise
approved by the board.&nbsp; If an electric power supplier or gas supplier does
not advertise using cost per kilowatt hour or per therm, the electric power
supplier or gas supplier shall provide, at the customer's request, an estimate
of the cost per kilowatt hour or per therm.&nbsp; Any optional charges to the
customer shall be identified separately and denoted as optional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Credit standards shall
include, at a minimum, that the credit requirements used to make decisions must
be the same for all residential customers and that electric power suppliers,
gas suppliers, and private aggregators not impose unreasonable income or credit
requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Billing standards shall
include, at a minimum, provisions prohibiting electric public utilities, gas
public utilities, electric power suppliers, and gas suppliers from charging a
fee to residential customers for either the commencement or termination of
electric generation service or gas supply service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1) Except as provided
in paragraph (2) of this subsection, an electric power supplier, a gas
supplier, an electric public utility, and a gas public utility shall not
disclose, sell, or transfer individual proprietary information, including, but
not limited to, a customer's name, address, telephone number, energy usage, and
electric power payment history, to a third party without the consent of the
customer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   (a) An electric public
utility or a gas public utility may disclose and provide, in an electronic
format, which may include a CD rom, diskette, and other format as determined by
the board, without the consent of a residential customer, a residential
customer's name, rate class, and account number, to a government aggregator
that is a municipality or a county, or to an energy agent acting as a
