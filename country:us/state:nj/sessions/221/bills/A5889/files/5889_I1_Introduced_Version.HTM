A5889 ASSEMBLY, No. 5889 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 26, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  WILLIAM B. SAMPSON, IV District 31 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS Institutes State contract set-aside program for union business enterprises. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the designation of certain State purchase and construction contracts as set-asides for businesses with a union workforce and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Set-Aside Act for Union Business Enterprises." 2.  As used in this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Contracting agency means the State or any board, commission, committee, authority, or agency of the State. Department means the Department of the Treasury. Union means any organization which exists and is constituted for the purpose, in whole or in part, of collective bargaining, or of dealing with employers concerning grievances, terms or conditions of employment, or of other mutual aid or protection in connection with employment. Union business enterprise means any business enterprise, including a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation, that has a union workforce, has its principal place of business in the State, hires apprentices, and makes a good faith effort to hire and maintain a diverse workforce, with documentation of such effort. Union business enterprise set-aside contract means a contract for goods, equipment, construction, or services which is designated as a contract with respect to which bids are invited and accepted only from union business enterprises, or a portion of a contract when that portion has been so designated. 3.  The Department of the Treasury shall administer a union business enterprise set-aside program which shall be in addition to any other set-aside program established by law.  The department shall require proof that the business meets the requirements of a union business enterprise as defined in section 2 of this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 4.  a.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any State bidding or public contracts laws to the contrary, but subject to any superseding federal statutes or rules, contracting agencies may, in consultation with the department, designate a contract, or a portion thereof, for goods, equipment, construction, or services to be awarded by a contracting agency as a union business enterprise set-aside contract pursuant to the goals and procedures established in this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), whenever there is a reasonable expectation that bids may be obtained from at least three qualified union business enterprises capable of furnishing the desired goods, equipment, construction, or services at a fair and reasonable price.  The designation shall be made prior to the advertisement for bids. b.  When application of the goals and procedures established under this act would jeopardize the State's participation in a program from which the State receives federal funds or other benefits, the contracting agency may, in consultation with the department, withdraw the affected contracts from consideration or calculation. 5.  a.  There is established the goal that contracting agencies award at least 22 percent of their contracts to union business enterprises.  This goal may, when appropriate, be attained by the direct designation of prime contracts for these businesses or, in the case of a prime contract not directly so designated, by requiring that a portion of such a prime contract be subcontracted to a union business enterprise.  Each contracting agency shall make a good faith effort to attain the goal established in this subsection. b.  For purposes of attaining this goal, contracting agencies shall, when necessary, specifically set aside contracts or portions of contracts for which only these businesses may bid. c.  If the department and the contracting agency disagree as to whether a set-aside is appropriate for a contract or a portion of a contract, the dispute shall be submitted, within seven days, to the State Treasurer, or a designee, for final determination. 6.  a.  Each contracting agency shall annually develop, in consultation with the department, a plan for achieving its union business enterprise goal. b.  The department shall consult regularly with representatives of the contracting industry for the purpose of implementing the provisions of this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  These consultations shall take place no less than once every six months. 7.  The advertisement for bids on a union business enterprise set-aside contract shall indicate the invitation to bid as a set-aside.  The advertisement shall be in such newspaper or newspapers as will best give notice thereof to appropriate bidders and shall be sufficiently in advance of the purchase or contract to promote competitive bidding among the businesses for which the contract is being set aside.  The newspaper or newspapers in which the advertisement shall appear shall be selected by the contracting agency in consultation with the department.  The advertisement shall designate the time and place at which sealed proposals shall be received and publicly opened and read, the amount of the cash or certified check, if any, which shall accompany each bid, and such other items as the contracting agency may deem proper.  The advertisement shall be made by that contracting agency pursuant to the procedure set forth in the law governing State contracts, when this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), is inconsistent with that law. 8.  a.  The department shall establish reasonable regulations appropriate for controlling the designation of prospective union business enterprise bidders and shall maintain lists of designated businesses. b.  The department shall establish a procedure whereby businesses may request inclusion on appropriate lists for union business enterprises. c.  The department shall establish a procedure for annually reviewing the lists and determining whether the businesses on the lists shall continue to be designated as union business enterprises. d.  The department shall establish a procedure whereby the designation of a business as a union business enterprise may be challenged by a third party. e.  Any procedures established pursuant to subsections b., c., and d. of this section shall include notice to the business whose designation is at issue and an opportunity for a hearing at the department.  The hearing shall not be considered a contested case under the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 9.  When a contract or portion thereof has been designated as a union business enterprise set-aside, invitations for bids shall be confined to businesses designated by the department as appropriate for the set-aside and bids from other bidders shall be rejected.  The purchase, contract, or expenditure of funds shall be awarded among the businesses, considering conformity with specifications and terms, in accordance with the statutes and rules governing purchases by the contracting agency.  The award shall be made with reasonable promptness by the contracting agency with written notice to the department. 10.  If the contracting agency determines that the acceptance of the lowest responsible bid on a union business enterprise set-aside contract will result either in the payment of an unreasonable price or in a contract otherwise unacceptable pursuant to the statutes and rules governing purchases by that agency, the contracting agency shall reject all bids and withdraw the designation of the set-aside contract. Bidders shall be notified of the set-aside cancellation, the reasons for the rejection, and the State's intent to resolicit bids on an unrestricted basis. The canceled solicitation shall not be counted as a set-aside for the purpose of attaining the established set-aside goal.  Except in cases of emergency, prior to the final award of the contract, the contracting agency shall provide an opportunity for a hearing on the reasons for the rejection of the set-aside designation.  This hearing shall not be considered a contested case under the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 11.  Each contracting agency shall submit an annual report to the department according to a schedule announced by the department.  This report shall include: a.  the total dollar value and number of contracts awarded to union business enterprises, including a separate accounting of any set-aside contracts, and the percentage of the total State procurements by the contracting agency that the figure of total dollar value and the number of set-asides reflect; b.  the types and sizes of businesses receiving set-aside awards and the nature of the purchases and contracts; and c.  the efforts made to publicize and promote the program. The department shall receive and analyze the reports submitted by the contracting agencies and, utilizing this data, submit an annual report to the Governor, and the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), showing the progress being made toward the objectives and goals of this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), during the preceding fiscal year. 12.  When the department determines that a business has been classified as a union business enterprise on the basis of false information knowingly supplied by the business and has been awarded a contract to which it would not otherwise have been entitled under this act, P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the department shall: a.  assess the business any difference between the contract amount and what the State's cost would have been if the contract had not been awarded in accordance with the provisions of this act; b.  in addition to the amount due under subsection a. of this section, assess the business a penalty in an amount of not more than 10 percent of the amount of the contract involved; c.  order the business ineligible to transact any business with the State for a period of not less than three months and not more than 24 months; and d.  prior to any final determination, assessment, or order under this section, afford the business an opportunity for a contested case hearing pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). All payments to the State pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall be deposited in the fund out of which the contract involved was awarded.  All payments to the State pursuant to subsection b. of this section shall be deposited in the General Fund. 13.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill creates a State contract set-aside program for union business enterprises. Under the bill, "union business enterprise" means any business enterprise, including a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation, that has a union workforce, has its principal place of business in the State, hires apprentices, and makes a good faith effort to hire and maintain a diverse workforce, with documentation of such effort.  Union" means any organization which exists and is constituted for the purpose, in whole or in part, of collective bargaining, or of dealing with employers concerning grievances, terms or conditions of employment, or of other mutual aid or protection in connection with employment. The Department of the Treasury will administer the program.  The department will require proof that the business meets the requirements of a union business enterprise. The bill establishes the goal that contracting agencies award at least 22 percent of their contracts to union business enterprises.  Each contracting agency will annually develop, in consultation with the department, a plan for achieving its union business enterprise set-aside goal. The department will establish reasonable regulations appropriate for controlling the designation of prospective union business enterprise bidders and will maintain lists of designated businesses.  The department will also establish a procedure whereby businesses may request inclusion on appropriate lists for union business enterprises, and a procedure for annually reviewing the lists and determining whether the businesses on the lists should continue to be designated as union business enterprises. The department will assess penalties if it determines that a business has been classified as a union business enterprise on the basis of false information knowingly supplied by the business, and been awarded a contract to which it would not otherwise have been entitled.
