Volunteer ambulance, first aid and rescue squads are eligible for reimbursement from the fund if the squad does not receive any payment for the provision of emergency medical services, regardless of whether the individual EMTs on the squad are paid by the squad for their services. The bill would revise these requirements to provide that any agency, organization, or entity may be eligible for reimbursement from the fund for the unreimbursed costs of training and certifying a volunteer EMT, regardless of whether the ambulance, first aid and rescue squad employing or utilizing the services of the volunteer EMT charges for the provision of basic life support services. The priority for reimbursement from the fund would be initial EMT training and certification classes and EMT refresher recertification classes. The bill requires that all reimbursements from the fund be promptly paid upon receipt of a qualifying application for reimbursement, which payment is to be made to the agency, organization, or entity that provided training to the volunteer EMT.  The bill provides that the head of each ambulance, first aid and rescue squad will be required to notify the Department of Health whenever an individual who received initial EMT training from an agency, organization, or entity that received reimbursement from the fund for providing the initial EMT training to that individual, ceases to serve as a volunteer EMT within a given three-year certification period. The bill provides that the head of the ambulance, first aid and rescue squad employing or utilizing the services of an EMT, who received initial EMT training that was reimbursed by the fund, will determine the EMT to be a volunteer in good standing provided that the EMT works at least one service call per month during the initial three-year certification period as a volunteer EMT. A volunteer EMT is defined under the bill to mean an EMT who provides basic life support services without receiving any compensation, such as an hourly wage or a salary. The bill requires the head of the ambulance, first aid and rescue squad to seek reimbursement from an EMT that ceases to be a volunteer in good standing for monies paid out of the fund in connection with the EMTs training, testing, certification, recertification, as appropriate, for that initial three-year certification period.  The Department of Health will exercise oversight authority over the collection of funds.
