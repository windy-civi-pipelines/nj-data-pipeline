All public offices of State government in this State shall be open on this day for the transaction of business. (cf: P.L.2020, c.76, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill removes Election Day as a State and public holiday. The designation of the third Friday in June each year as Juneteenth Day has added additional financial considerations.  It is estimated that the additional holiday will add $3 million dollars each year to the States costs for overtime costs in the Department of Corrections, Department of Human Services, Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, and the Juvenile Justice Commission.  The additional holiday would also lead to an increase in costs for local and county governments.  The increase in costs could potentially result in higher property taxes for the communities. It is the sponsors belief that removing Election Day would save the State more money than the addition of Juneteenth Day would cost.  Election Day, while a State and public holiday, still requires various State, county, and district employees to work to ensure a fair, accurate, and secure election.  For example, municipal clerk offices are required to be open on Election Day from 6am to 8pm.  In addition, the Superior Court assignment judge for each county is required to work during an election to ensure a fair process.  Removing Election Day would also lead to savings for local and county governments.
