(i)   The odor of marijuana or hashish, or burnt marijuana or hashish, shall not constitute reasonable articulable suspicion to initiate a search of a person to determine a violation of subparagraph (b) of paragraph (12) of this subsection.  A person who violates this subparagraph shall not be subject to arrest, detention, or otherwise be taken into custody, unless the person is being arrested, detained, or otherwise taken into custody for also committing another violation of law for which that action is legally permitted or required; (ii)  A person shall not be deprived of any legal or civil right, privilege, benefit, or opportunity provided pursuant to any law solely by reason of committing a violation of subparagraph (b) of paragraph (12) of this subsection, nor shall committing one or more violations modify any legal or civil right, privilege, benefit, or opportunity provided pursuant to any law, including, but not limited to, the granting, renewal, forfeiture, or denial of a license, permit, or certification, qualification for and the receipt, alteration, continuation, or denial of any form of financial assistance, housing assistance, or other social services, rights of or custody by a biological parent, or adoptive or foster parent, or other legal guardian of a child or newborn infant, or pregnant woman, in any action or proceeding by the Division of Child Protection and Permanency in the Department of Children and Families, or qualification, approval, or disapproval to serve as a foster parent or other legal guardian; (iii) All local and county law enforcement authorities shall, following the submission process used for the uniform crime reporting system established by P.L.1966, c.37 (C.52:17B-5.1 et seq.), submit a quarterly report to the Uniform Crime Reporting Unit, within the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety, or to another designated recipient determined by the Attorney General, containing the number of violations of subparagraph (b) of paragraph (12) of this subsection committed within their respective jurisdictions, plus the race, ethnicity, gender, and age of each person committing a violation, and the disposition of each person's violation.  These violations and associated information, along with a quarterly summary of violations investigated, and associated information collected, by the Division of State Police for the same period shall be summarized by county and municipality in an annual report, and both quarterly summaries and annual reports shall be made available at no cost to the public on the Division of State Police's Internet website;

(cf: P.L.2021, c.19, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would increase the penalties for unlawfully manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing fentanyl. Fentanyl is an anesthetic and analgesic, first synthesized in the 1950s, that in recent years has become a drug of abuse. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, fentanyl is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin and is potentially lethal even at very low doses. Under current law, set out in paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5 and section 6 of P.L.1970, c.226 (C.24:21-6), unlawfully manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing fentanyl in a quantity of one ounce or more is a crime of the second degree. A crime of the second degree is generally punishable by a term of imprisonment of five to ten years or a fine up to $150,000, or both.   Unlawfully manufacturing, distributing or dispensing fentanyl in a quantity of less than one ounce is a crime of the third degree. A crime of the third degree is generally punishable by a term of three to five years or a fine up to $15,000, or both.  However, the fine imposed for the third degree offense involving fentanyl is increased to up to $75,000. Under the bill, the penalties for unlawfully manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing fentanyl would match the penalties for manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing heroin or cocaine under current law.  The bill provides that unlawfully manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing fentanyl in a quantity of five ounces or more would be a crime of the first degree. A crime of the first degree is generally punishable by a term of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years or a fine of up to $200,000, or both.  Under the bill the defendant would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of one-third to one-half of the sentence imposed, during which the defendant would be ineligible for parole. The defendant would also be sentenced to pay an increased fine of up to  $500,000. The bill provides that if the quantity of fentanyl unlawfully manufactured, distributed, or dispensed is one-half ounce or more but less than five ounces, the defendant would be guilty of a crime of the second degree.  If the quantity is less than one-half ounce, the defendant would be guilty of a crime of the third degree with an increased fine of up to $75,000.
