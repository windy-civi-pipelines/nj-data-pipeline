<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. Section 8 of P.L.1973, c.83
(C.19:44A-8) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8. a. (1) Each political
committee shall make a full cumulative report, upon a form prescribed by the
Election Law Enforcement Commission, of all contributions in excess of $200 in the
form of moneys, loans, paid personal services, or other things of value made to
it and all expenditures made, incurred, or authorized by it in furtherance of
the nomination, election, or defeat of any candidate, or in aid of the passage
or defeat of any public question, or to provide political information on any
candidate or public question, during the period ending 48 hours preceding the
date of the report and beginning on the date on which the first of those
contributions was received or the first of those expenditures was made,
whichever occurred first.  The cumulative report, except as hereinafter
provided, shall contain the name and mailing address of each person or group
from whom moneys, loans, paid personal services or other things of value in excess
of $200 have been contributed since 48 hours preceding the date on which the
previous such report was made and the amount contributed by each person or
group, and where the contributor is an individual, the report shall indicate
the occupation of the individual and the name and mailing address of the
individual's employer.  In the case of any loan reported pursuant to this
subsection, the report shall contain the name and mailing address of each
person who has cosigned such loan since 48 hours preceding the date on which
the previous such report was made, and where an individual has cosigned such
loans, the report shall indicate the occupation of the individual and the name
and mailing address of the individual's employer.  The cumulative report shall
also contain the name and address of each person, firm or organization to whom
expenditures have been paid since 48 hours preceding the date on which the
previous such report was made and the amount and purpose of each such
expenditure.  The cumulative report shall be filed with the Election Law
Enforcement Commission on the dates designated in section 16 hereof.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The campaign treasurer of the
political committee reporting shall certify to the correctness of each report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each campaign treasurer of a
political committee shall file written notice with the commission of a
contribution in excess of $200 received during the period between the 13th day
prior to the election and the date of the election, and of an expenditure of
money or other thing of value in excess of $200 made, incurred or authorized by
the political committee to support or defeat a candidate in an election, or to
aid the passage or defeat of any public question, during the period between the
13th day prior to the election and the date of the election.  The notice of a
contribution shall be filed in writing or by electronic transmission within 72
hours of the receipt of the contribution when the contribution is received
between the 13th day and the eighth day prior to the election, or within 24
hours of the receipt of the contribution when the contribution is received
between the seventh day prior to the election and the date of the election. 
The notice shall set forth the amount and date of the contribution, the name
and mailing address of the contributor, and where the contributor is an
individual, the individual's occupation and the name and mailing address of the
individual's employer.  The notice of an expenditure shall be filed in writing
or by electronic transmission within 72 hours of the making, incurring or
authorization of the expenditure when the expenditure is made, incurred, or
authorized between the 13th day and the eighth day prior to the election, or
within 24 hours when the expenditure is made, incurred, or authorized between the
seventh day prior to the election and the date of the election.  The notice
shall set forth the name and mailing address of the person, firm or
organization to whom or which the expenditure was paid and the amount and
purpose of the expenditure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) When a political committee
or an individual seeking party office makes or authorizes an expenditure on
behalf of a candidate, it shall provide immediate written notification to the
candidate of the expenditure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) A group of two or more
persons acting jointly, or any corporation, partnership, or any other
incorporated or unincorporated association including a political club,
political action committee, civic association or other organization, which in
any calendar year contributes or expects to contribute at least $2,500.00 to
the aid or promotion of the candidacy of an individual, or of the candidacies
of individuals, for elective public office or the passage or defeat of a public
question or public questions and which expects to make contributions toward
such aid or promotion, or toward such passage or defeat, during a subsequent
election shall certify that fact to the commission, and the commission, upon
receiving that certification and on the basis of any information as it may
require of the group, corporation, partnership, association or other
organization, shall determine whether the group, corporation, partnership,
association or other organization is a continuing political committee for the
purposes of this act.  If the commission determines that the group,
corporation, partnership, association or other organization is a continuing
political committee, it shall so notify that continuing political committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No person serving as the
chairman of a political party committee or a legislative leadership committee
shall be eligible to be appointed or to serve as the chairman of a continuing
political committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) A continuing political
committee shall file with the Election Law Enforcement Commission, not later
than April 15, July 15, October 15 and January 15 of each calendar year, a
cumulative quarterly report of all moneys, loans, paid personal services or
other things of value in excess of $200 contributed to it during the period
ending on the 15th day preceding that date and commencing on January 1 of that
calendar year or, in the case of the cumulative quarterly report to be filed
not later than January 15, of the previous calendar year, and all expenditures
made, incurred, or authorized by it during the period, whether or not such
expenditures were made, incurred or authorized in furtherance of the election
or defeat of any candidate, or in aid of the passage or defeat of any public
question or to provide information on any candidate or public question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The cumulative quarterly
report shall contain the name and mailing address of each person or group from
whom moneys, loans, paid personal services or other things of value in excess
of $200 have been contributed and the amount contributed by each person or

indicate the occupation of the individual and the name and mailing address of
the individual's employer.  In the case of any loan reported pursuant to this
subsection, the report shall contain the name and address of each person who
