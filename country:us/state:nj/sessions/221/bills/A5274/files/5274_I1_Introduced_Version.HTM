Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 11 of P.L.2019,
c.153 (C.24:6I-7.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11. a. The commission shall,
no later than 90 days after the effective date of P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-5.1
et al.) or upon adoption of rules and regulations as provided in subsection c.
of section 18 of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-16), whichever occurs later, begin
accepting and processing applications for new medical cannabis cultivator,
medical cannabis manufacturer, and medical cannabis dispensary permits. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsubparagraph (i) of subparagraph (a) of
paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-7), the
first three alternative treatment center permits issued by the commission
pursuant to an application submitted on or after the effective date of
P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-5.1 et al.) and up to four alternative treatment
centers permits issued by the commission after the effective date of P.L.2019,
c.153 (C.24:6I-5.1 et al.) pursuant to an application submitted pursuant to a
request for applications published in the New Jersey Register prior to the effective
date of P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-5.1 et al.) shall be deemed to concurrently
hold a medical cannabis cultivator permit, a medical cannabis manufacturer
permit, and a medical cannabis dispensary permit; of these permits, one permit
shall be issued to an applicant located in the northern region of the State,
one permit shall be issued to an applicant located in the central region of the
State, and one permit shall be issued to an applicant located in the southern
region of the State.  Any permits issued by the commission thereafter shall be
subject to the provisions of subsubparagraph (i) of subparagraph (a) of
paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-7), and
the requirements of subsection d. of this section concerning conditional
permits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commission may
establish nonrefundable application fees for permit applications and
conditional permit applications, and permit and conditional permit fees for
successful applicants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1) The commission
shall make a determination as to any permit application, other than an
application for a conditional permit submitted pursuant to subsection d. of
this section, no later than 90 days after receiving the application, which may
include a determination that the commission reasonably requires more time to
adequately review the application.  <u>If the commission determines that more
time is required to adequately review an application, the commission shall, not
more than 30 days after a determination for more time for review, make a determination
as to whether the application is approved or denied.</u>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The commission shall
issue a permit, other than a conditional permit, to an approved applicant at
such time as the commission completes the application review process and any
mandatory inspections, and determines that the applicant is in compliance with
and is implementing the plans, procedures, protocols, actions, or other
measures set forth in the applicant's permit application submitted pursuant to
section 12 of P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-7.2), did maintain compliance with the
terms, conditions, or restrictions of a conditional permit issued to the
applicant, if applicable, and is otherwise in compliance with the requirements
of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d. (1) The commission shall
ensure that at least one third of the total permits issued for each type of
medical cannabis permit are conditional permits, which one-third figure shall
include any conditional permit issued to an applicant which is subsequently
converted by the commission into a full permit pursuant to paragraph (4) of
this subsection and any conditional permit, including a converted permit,
issued to a microbusiness pursuant to subsection e. of this section.  The
requirements of this subsection shall not apply to permits issued to clinical
registrants or to permits issued to the three alternative treatment centers
issued a permit pursuant to subsection a. of this section that are expressly
exempt from the provisions of subsubparagraph (i) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph
(2) of subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-7).</p>

conditional permit shall include: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   documentation that the
applicant entity includes at least one significantly involved person who has
resided in this State for at least two years as of the date of the application;</p>

and each significantly involved person in, the proposed medical cannabis
entity, provided that a conditional permit may be issued pending the results of
a criminal history record background check;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   documentation that each
significantly involved person in the proposed medical cannabis entity has, for
the immediately preceding taxable year, an adjusted gross income of no more
than $200,000 or no more than $400,000 if filing jointly with another;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   a certification that
each significantly involved person in the proposed medical cannabis entity does

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a municipality
may not prohibit the operation of a retailer of cannabis items by any medical
cannabis dispensary issued a permit pursuant to the Medical Cannabis Act that
has been opened and operating without any violation, or notice thereof, for a
period of not less than 180 days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a municipality
may impose separate local licensing or endorsement requirements as a part of
its restrictions on the number of operations of cannabis licensees, or their
location, manner, or times of operation.  Under the bill, a restriction on the
number or location of cannabis licensees operating in a municipality does not
apply to any medicinal cannabis retailer operating as of the effective date of
the CREAMMA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also prohibits the
Cannabis Regulatory Commission (commission) from requiring municipal review,
consent, or approval as a condition of issuing a Class 5 Retailer License to a medical
cannabis dispensary issued a permit pursuant to the Medical Cannabis Act, which
is also applying for approval or renewal of a Class 5 Retailer License pursuant
to CREAMMA that is proposed to be co-located on the premises of an existing
medical cannabis dispensary in a municipality that permits the retail sale of
medical cannabis, but not the retail sale of adult-use cannabis items.  Any
prior approval authorizing the medical cannabis dispensary to lawfully operate
on the premises shall be deemed to authorize the Class 5 Cannabis Retailer use
at the same location for all purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law and
commission regulations, the commission has 30 days to make a determination on a
completed conditional license, and 90 days to make a determination on a
completed annual license application.  Before the expiration of these periods,
the commission may make a determination that it requires more time to
adequately review the application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, if the commission
determines that it requires more time to adequately review an application, the
commission is required to, not more than 30 days after a determination for more
time to review, make a determination as to whether the application is approved
or denied, effectively establishing a cap on the total amount of time the
commission has to make a decision on an application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the commission
will no longer establish a point scale and rank applicants based on that
score.  The bill also removes the requirement that certain documents be
submitted for commission review, and establishes that the commission <i>may</i>
require such documents be included for review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes that the
commission is no longer required to verify that the following information be
contained in an application: (1) a business plan and management operation
profile for the proposed cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery
service; or (2) the plan by which the applicant intends to obtain appropriate
liability insurance coverage for the cannabis establishment, distributor, or
delivery service.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill removes the
requirement that the commission give greater weight to certain applicants when
evaluating the experience of an applicant.  The bill also removes the
requirement that the commission give special consideration to any applicant
that has entered into an agreement with an institute of higher education to
create an integrated curriculum. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, the bill permits the
commission to give an applicant a certain amount of time, determined by the
commission, to comply with additional conditions, outside of those which were
required for licensure, rather than limiting that period to 45 days.</p>

regulation, ordinance, or any change to a regulation or ordinance is required
to submit the regulation or ordinance to the commission for purposes of
