residual testing at frequent and regular intervals to determine the amount and
type of detectable disinfectant residual existing at different points in the
public water system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      b.   (1)  If the owner or
operator of a public water system repeatedly fails to meet the minimum
detectable disinfectant residual of chlorine targets established pursuant to
paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section and the violations are reported
to the Department of Environmental Protection, the public water system shall
conduct an internal investigation of the violations.  If, after the public
water system conducts an investigation, subsequent failures to meet the targets
are reported, the Department of Environmental Protection shall conduct an
investigation of the subsequent violations or, at its discretion, authorize a
third-party entity to conduct the investigation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The Department of

penalties for a violation of chlorine targets, if the department determines
that a violation has occurred;  </p>

notice to inform consumers if a public water system fails to maintain the
minimum detectable disinfectant residual of chlorine targets established
pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   the criteria used by the
