ATKINS District 20 (Union) SYNOPSIS Declares March of each year as Blood Clot Awareness Month. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution declaring March of each year as Blood Clot Awareness Month. Whereas, A blood clot is a mass of blood that forms when platelets, proteins, and cells in the blood stick together.  The body naturally forms blood clots after an injury to stop bleeding and to help the wound heal; and Whereas, Sometimes, however, blood clots form where they should not, the body makes too many blood clots or abnormal blood clots, or blood clots formed to stop bleeding do not break down following an injury.  These blood clots are dangerous and can materialize throughout the body. They can lead to illness, disability, and even death if not treated early, and do not discriminate by age, gender, ethnicity, or race; and Whereas, As indicated by the public education campaign Stop the Clot, Spread the Word, made possible through the partnership of the National Blood Clot Alliance and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to 900,000 people are negatively affected by blood clots every year; and Whereas, An estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Americans die annually due to blood clots and many others have long-term complications; and Whereas, Blood clots can be further defined as a deep vein thrombosis or a pulmonary embolism; and Whereas, A deep vein thrombosis occurs if a blood clot forms in one of the large veins, typically in a person's lower leg, thigh, pelvis, or arm.  This type of blood clot can partly or completely block the flow of blood or blood circulation in the body.  If a blood clot is not treated, it can travel to the lungs, causing a blockage known as a pulmonary embolism, which requires immediate medical attention; and Whereas, It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of a blood clot, with a deep vein thrombosis often presenting as swelling, pain, tenderness, and redness or discoloration of the skin at the affected area; and Whereas, By comparison, a pulmonary embolism often is associated with difficulty breathing, a faster than normal or irregular heartbeat, coughing up blood, and very low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting; and Whereas, The negative consequences of blood clots are preventable, and the best ways to avoid them include:  knowing the risks factors, recognizing the signs and symptoms, informing a medical professional of any risk factors, speaking with a medical professional about blood clots before any surgical procedure, and seeing a medical professional as soon as possible when symptoms emerge; and Whereas, To better inform the public of the risks, signs, and symptoms of blood clots, the National Blood Clot Alliance annually promotes March as Blood Clot Awareness Month; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The month of March shall be designated at Blood Clot Awareness Month in the State of New Jersey in order join the National Blood Clot Alliance in raising public awareness of prevention measures and of the signs and symptoms of blood clots; thereby, helping the residents of this State avoid the negative health consequences associated with blood clots. 2.    The Governor is respectfully requested to issue a proclamation each year calling upon public officials and the citizens of this State to observe the month of March as Blood Clot Awareness Month with appropriate activities and programs. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This Joint Resolution declares March of each year as Blood Clot Awareness Month in the State of New Jersey. A blood clot is a mass of blood that forms when platelets, proteins, and cells in the blood stick together.  The body naturally forms blood clots after an injury to stop bleeding and to help the wound heal.  Sometimes, however, blood clots form where they should not, the body makes too many blood clots or abnormal blood clots, or blood clots formed to stop bleeding do not break down.

As indicated by the public education campaign Stop the Clot, Spread the Word, up to 900,000 people are negatively affected by blood clots every year.  Moreover, an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Americans die annually due to blood clots and many others have long-term complications. The negative consequences of blood clots are preventable, and the best ways to avoid them include:  knowing the risks factors, recognizing the signs and symptoms, informing a medical professional of any risk factors, speaking with a medical professional about blood clots before any surgical procedure, and seeing a medical professional as soon as possible when symptoms emerge.  To better inform the public of the risks, signs, and symptoms of blood clots, this resolution joins the National Blood Clot Alliance in annually promoting March as Blood Clot Awareness Month.
