be subject to review through the declaratory judgment process as established in
paragraph (3) of this subsection.  As part of its housing element and fair
share plan, the municipality shall include an assessment of the degree to which
the municipality has met its fair share obligation from the prior rounds of
affordable housing obligations as established by prior court approval, or
approval by the council, and determine to what extent this obligation is
unfulfilled or whether the municipality has credits in excess of its prior
round obligations.  If a prior round obligation remains unfulfilled, or a municipality
never received an approval from court or the council for any prior round, the
municipality shall address such unfulfilled prior round obligation in its
housing element and fair share plan.  Units included as part of the
municipalitys unfulfilled prior round obligation shall not count towards the
cap on units in the municipalitys prospective need obligation.  In addressing
prior round obligations, the municipality shall retain any sites that, in
furtherance of the prior round obligation, are the subject of a contractual
agreement with a developer, or for which the developer has filed a complete
application seeking subdivision or site plan approval prior to the date by
which the housing element and fair share plan are required to be submitted, and
shall demonstrate how any sites that were not built in the prior rounds
continue to present a realistic opportunity, which may include proposing
changes to the zoning on the site to make its development more likely, and
which may also include the dedication of municipal affordable housing trust
fund dollars or other monetary or in-kind resources.  The municipality shall
only plan to replace any sites planned for development as provided by a prior
court approval, settlement agreement, or approval by the council, with
alternative development plans, if it is determined that the previously planned
sites no longer present a realistic opportunity, and the sites in the
alternative development plan provide at least an equivalent number of
affordable units and are otherwise in compliance with the &quot;Fair Housing
Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel
doctrine.  If a municipality proposes to replace a site for which a complete
application seeking subdivision or site plan approval has not been filed prior
to date by which the housing element and fair share plan is required to be
submitted, there shall be a rebuttable presumption in any challenge filed to
the municipality's plan that any site for which a zoning designation was
adopted creating a realistic opportunity for the development of a site prior to
July 1, 2020, or July 1 of every 10th year thereafter, as applicable, may be
replaced with one or more alternative sites that provide a realistic
opportunity for at least the same number of affordable units and is otherwise
in compliance with the &quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222
(C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine.  To the extent a
municipality has credits, including bonus credits, from units created during a
prior round that are otherwise permitted to be allocated toward the
municipalitys unfulfilled prior round obligation or present or prospective
need obligation in an upcoming round, the municipality shall be entitled to
rely on the rules, including rules for bonus credits, applicable for the round
during which those credits were accumulated.  If a municipality has credits in
excess of its prior round obligations, and such excess credits represent
housing that will continue to be deed-restricted and affordable through the
current round, the municipality may include such housing, and applicable bonus
credits, towards addressing the municipalitys new calculation of prospective
need.  Consistent with subsection k. of section 11 of P.L.1985, c.222
(C.52:27D-311), the total number of bonus credits shall in no circumstance
exceed 25 percent of the municipalitys prospective obligation in any round. 
The municipality may in its plan lower its prospective need obligation to the
extent necessary to prevent establishing a prospective need obligation that
requires the municipality to provide a realistic opportunity for more than
1,000 housing units, after the application of any excess credits, or to prevent
a prospective need obligation that exceeds 20 percent of the total number of
households in a municipality according to the most recent federal decennial
census, not including any prior round obligation.  If a municipality is subject
to both a 1,000 unit cap or 20 percent cap it may apply whichever cap results
in a lower prospective need obligation.  For the fifth round, and for each
subsequent new round of housing obligations, the deadlines in this paragraph
shall be June 30 for the adoption of the housing element and fair share plan,
and the proposal of drafts of the appropriate zoning and other ordinances and
