CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Assembly Appropriations Committee on February 8, 2024, with amendments. An Act concerning affordable housing, including administration and municipal obligations, amending, supplementing, and repealing various parts of the statutory law, and making an appropriation. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. Section 2 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-302) is amended to read as follows: 2.   The Legislature finds that: a.   The New Jersey Supreme Court, through its rulings in [South] Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 67 N.J. 151 (1975) and [South] Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 92 N.J. 158 (1983), has determined that every municipality in a growth area has a constitutional obligation to provide through its land use regulations a realistic opportunity for a fair share of its region's present and prospective needs for housing for [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income families. b.   In the second Mount Laurel ruling, the Supreme Court stated that the determination of the methods for satisfying this constitutional obligation "is better left to the Legislature," that the court has "always preferred legislative to judicial action in their field," and that the judicial role in upholding the Mount Laurel doctrine "could decrease as a result of legislative and executive action." c.   The interest of all citizens, including [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income families in need of affordable housing, and the needs of the workforce, would be best served by a comprehensive planning and implementation response to this constitutional obligation. d.   There are a number of essential ingredients to a comprehensive planning and implementation response, including the establishment of reasonable fair share housing guidelines and standards, the initial determination of fair share by officials at the municipal level and the preparation of a municipal housing element, State review of the local fair share study and housing element, and continuous State funding for [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing to replace the federal housing subsidy programs which have been almost completely eliminated. e.   The State can maximize the number of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income units provided in New Jersey by allowing its municipalities to adopt appropriate phasing schedules for meeting their fair share, so long as the municipalities permit a timely achievement of an appropriate fair share of the regional need for [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing as required by the Mt. Laurel I and II opinions and other relevant court decisions. f.    The State can also maximize the number of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income units by creating new affordable housing and by rehabilitating existing, but substandard, housing in the State.  Because the Legislature has determined, pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1 et al.), that it is no longer appropriate or in harmony with the Mount Laurel doctrine to permit the transfer of the fair share obligations among municipalities within a housing region, it is necessary and appropriate to create a new program to create new affordable housing and to foster the rehabilitation of existing, but substandard, housing. g.   Since the urban areas are vitally important to the State, construction, conversion and rehabilitation of housing in our urban centers should be encouraged. However, the provision of housing in urban areas must be balanced with the need to provide housing throughout the State for the free mobility of citizens. h.   The Supreme Court of New Jersey in its Mount Laurel decisions demands that municipal land use regulations affirmatively afford a [reasonable] realistic opportunity for a variety and choice of housing including low and moderate cost housing, to meet the needs of people desiring to live there.  While provision for the actual construction of that housing by municipalities is not required, they are encouraged but not mandated to expend their own resources to help provide [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing. i.    [Certain amendments to the enabling act of the Council on Affordable Housing are necessary to provide guidance to the council to ensure consistency with the legislative intent, while at the same time clarifying the limitations of the council in its rulemaking.  Although the court has remarked in several decisions that the Legislature has granted the council considerable deference in its rulemaking, the Legislature retains its power and obligation to clarify and amend the enabling act from which the council derives its rulemaking power, from time to time, in order to better guide the council.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) j.    The Legislature finds that the use of regional contribution agreements, which permits municipalities to transfer a certain portion of their fair share housing obligation outside of the municipal borders, should no longer be utilized as a mechanism for the creation of affordable housing [by the council]. k. The Legislature finds that the role of the Council on Affordable Housing, as intended in the original enactment of the "Fair Housing Act," has not developed in practice as was intended in the legislation. l. The councils inability to function ultimately led the Supreme Court in 2015 to order the temporary dissolution of the requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted prior to resolving affordable housing disputes before the court, and allowed the courts to resume their role as the forum of first resort for evaluating municipal compliance with Mount Laurel obligations pursuant to guidelines laid out by the Supreme Courts order. m. The Legislature finds that the councils inability to function led to a "gap period" that frustrated the intent of the Legislature and compliance with constitutional and statutory obligations, and that it is necessary to establish definitive deadlines for municipal action and any challenges to those actions to avoid such a "gap period" from being repeated in the future. n. The Legislature finds that although the court-led system that has developed since 2015 has resulted in a significant number of settlement agreements and increased production of affordable housing, the system could operate more expeditiously to produce affordable housing, and at a lower cost to all parties, if appropriate standards are established by the Legislature to be applied throughout the State including more clarity on calculation on fair share affordable housing obligations using transparent and established data sources to eliminate the lengthy and costly processes of determining those obligations that have characterized both the Council on Affordable Housing and court-led system. o. The Legislature determines that, considering the unique history of the "Fair Housing Act," the Council on Affordable Housing shall be abolished, and that, pursuant to the formulas and process established pursuant to sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), a municipality shall be authorized to seek approval of its fair share affordable housing obligation, adopted pursuant to binding resolution and then filed with the court, with the guidance of calculations published by the Department of Community Affairs, but that advocates for the low- and moderate-income households of the State shall be provided with an opportunity to contest the municipal determination. p. 1The Legislature declares that the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), as amended and supplemented by P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), is intended to implement the Mount Laurel doctrine, and that municipalities in compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) are also in compliance with the Mount Laurel doctrine. q.1  The Legislature finds that the population of persons aged 65 years and older in the State has grown from approximately 13 percent in 1990, to 17 percent in 2021, and that such growth, in conjunction with expected future growth, makes it appropriate for the Legislature to 1[continue to]1 allow up to 1[25] 301 percent of the units towards a municipalitys prospective affordable housing obligation to be satisfied through the creation of age-restricted housing. (cf: P.L.2008, c.46, s.4) 2. Section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304) is amended to read as follows: 4.

Nothing in the provisions of subsections c., d., or f. of this section shall be interpreted to render any calculation in a report by the department published pursuant to this section binding on any municipality or other entity, nor to render any failure by the department to timely conduct the calculations or publish a report required by this section to alter the deadlines or process set forth in this section.  The ultimate determination of a municipalitys present and prospective need shall be through the process as set forth below. f. (1)  (a)  With consideration of the calculations contained in the relevant report published by the department pursuant to this section, for each 10-year round of affordable housing obligations beginning with the fourth round, a municipality shall determine its present and prospective fair share obligation for affordable housing in accordance with the formulas established in sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) by resolution, which shall describe the basis for the municipalitys determination and bind the municipality to adopt a housing element and fair share plan pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection based on this determination as may be adjusted by the program as set forth in this subsection. (b) For the fourth round of affordable housing obligations, this determination of present and prospective fair share obligation shall be made by binding resolution no later than January 31, 2025.  After adoption of this binding resolution, the municipality shall file an action regarding the resolution with the program no later than 48 hours following adoption.  The resolution, along with the date of filing with the program, shall be published on the programs publicly accessible Internet website.  The municipality shall also publish the resolution on its publicly accessible Internet website, if the municipality maintains one.  If the municipality does not meet this deadline, it 1[immediately]1 shall lose immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation until such time as the municipality is determined to have come into compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine.  A determination of the municipalitys present and prospective obligation may be established before a county level housing judge as part of any resulting declaratory judgment action pursuant to section 13 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-313), as amended by P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or through 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation.  If the municipality meets this January 31 deadline, then the municipalitys determination of its obligation shall be established by default 1, and shall bear a presumption of validity1 beginning on March 1, 2025, as the municipalitys obligation for the fourth round, unless challenged by an interested party on or before February 28, 2025.  1The municipalitys determination of its fair share obligation shall have a presumption of validity, if established in accordance with sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), in any challenge initiated through the program.1  An interested party may file a challenge with the program, after adoption of the binding resolution and prior to March 1, 2025, alleging that the municipalitys determination of its present and prospective obligation does not comply with the requirements of sections 6 and 7 of P.L. , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  For the fifth round, and each subsequent new round of housing obligations, the deadlines established in this subparagraph shall be on the last day of January, the last day of February, and the first day of March, respectively, of the year of the start of each new round. (c) The Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish procedures for the program to consider a challenge and resolve a dispute initiated by an interested party pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this paragraph.  To resolve a challenge, the program shall apply an objective assessment standard to determine whether or not the municipalitys calculation of its obligation is compliant with the requirements of sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Any challenge must state with particularity how the municipal calculation fails to comply with sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and include the challengers own calculation of the fair share obligations in compliance with sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C. and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The program shall establish procedures to summarily dismiss any objection or challenge that does not meet these minimum standards.  For the purpose of efficiency, the program shall, in its own discretion, permit multiple challenges to the same municipal determination to be consolidated.  The programs approach to resolving a dispute may include: (i) a finding that the municipalitys determination of its present and prospective need obligation did not facially comply with the requirements of sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C. and C.        )  (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and thus the municipalitys immunity shall be revoked; (ii) an adjustment of the municipalitys determination of its present and prospective need obligation to comply with the requirements of sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) without revoking immunity; or (iii) a rejection of a challenge and affirm the municipalitys determination.  The decision shall be provided to the municipality and all parties that have filed challenges no later than March 31 of the year when the current round is expiring and the new round is beginning and concurrently posted on the programs Internet website.  The Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish procedures for any further appellate review of such determinations, and may establish an expedited process for consolidated review of any such challenges by the Supreme Court, provided that any party seeking appellate review shall not change the deadlines established for municipal filing of a housing element and fair share plan, and implementing ordinances. (2) (a)  A municipality shall adopt a housing element and fair share plan as provided for by the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), and propose drafts of the appropriate zoning and other ordinances and resolutions to implement its present and prospective obligation established in paragraph (1) of this subsection on or before June 30, 2025.  After adoption of the housing element and fair share plan, and the proposal of drafts of the appropriate zoning and other ordinances and resolutions, the municipality shall within 48 hours of adoption or by June 30, 2025, whichever is sooner, file the same with the program as part of the action initiated pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of this subsection through the programs Internet website.  Any municipality that does not do so by June 30, 2025, shall not retain immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation until such time as the municipality is determined to have come into compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine and shall be subject to review through the declaratory judgment process as established in paragraph (3) of this subsection.  As part of its housing element and fair share plan, the municipality shall include an assessment of the degree to which the municipality has met its fair share obligation from the prior rounds of affordable housing obligations as established by prior court approval, or approval by the council, and determine to what extent this obligation is unfulfilled or whether the municipality has credits in excess of its prior round obligations.  If a prior round obligation remains unfulfilled, or a municipality never received an approval from court or the council for any prior round, the municipality shall address such unfulfilled prior round obligation in its housing element and fair share plan.  Units included as part of the municipalitys unfulfilled prior round obligation shall not count towards the cap on units in the municipalitys prospective need obligation.  In addressing prior round obligations, the municipality shall retain any sites that, in furtherance of the prior round obligation, are the subject of a contractual agreement with a developer, or for which the developer has filed a complete application seeking subdivision or site plan approval prior to the date by which the housing element and fair share plan are required to be submitted, and shall demonstrate how any sites that were not built in the prior rounds continue to present a realistic opportunity, which may include proposing changes to the zoning on the site to make its development more likely, and which may also include the dedication of municipal affordable housing trust fund dollars or other monetary or in-kind resources.  The municipality shall only plan to replace any sites planned for development as provided by a prior court approval, settlement agreement, or approval by the council, with alternative development plans, if it is determined that the previously planned sites no longer present a realistic opportunity, and the sites in the alternative development plan provide at least an equivalent number of affordable units and are otherwise in compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine.  If a municipality proposes to replace a site for which a complete application seeking subdivision or site plan approval has not been filed prior to date by which the housing element and fair share plan is required to be submitted, there shall be a rebuttable presumption in any challenge filed to the municipality's plan that any site for which a zoning designation was adopted creating a realistic opportunity for the development of a site prior to July 1, 2020, or July 1 of every 10th year thereafter, as applicable, may be replaced with one or more alternative sites that provide a realistic opportunity for at least the same number of affordable units and is otherwise in compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine.  To the extent a municipality has credits, including bonus credits, from units created during a prior round that are otherwise permitted to be allocated toward the municipalitys unfulfilled prior round obligation or present or prospective need obligation in an upcoming round, the municipality shall be entitled to rely on the rules, including rules for bonus credits, applicable for the round during which those credits were accumulated.  If a municipality has credits in excess of its prior round obligations, and such excess credits represent housing that will continue to be deed-restricted and affordable through the current round, the municipality may include such housing, and applicable bonus credits, towards addressing the municipalitys new calculation of prospective need.  Consistent with subsection k. of section 11 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-311), the total number of bonus credits shall in no circumstance exceed 25 percent of the municipalitys prospective obligation in any round. The municipality may in its plan lower its prospective need obligation to the extent necessary to prevent establishing a prospective need obligation that requires the municipality to provide a realistic opportunity for more than 1,000 housing units, after the application of any excess credits, or to prevent a prospective need obligation that exceeds 20 percent of the total number of households in a municipality according to the most recent federal decennial census, not including any prior round obligation.  If a municipality is subject to both a 1,000 unit cap or 20 percent cap it may apply whichever cap results in a lower prospective need obligation.  For the fifth round, and for each subsequent new round of housing obligations, the deadlines in this paragraph shall be June 30 for the adoption of the housing element and fair share plan, and the proposal of drafts of the appropriate zoning and other ordinances and resolutions to implement its present and prospective obligation, of the year of the start of the new round. (b) Following the filing, in an action, of an adopted housing element and fair share plan pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, an interested party may file a response on or before August 31, 2025 alleging that the municipalitys fair share plan and housing element are not in compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) or the Mount Laurel doctrine.  Such allegation shall not include a claim that a site on real property proposed by the interested party is a better site than a site in the plan, but rather shall be based on whether the housing element and fair share plan as proposed is compliant with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) or the Mount Laurel doctrine.  To resolve a challenge, the program shall apply an objective assessment standard to determine whether or not the municipalitys housing element and fair share plan is compliant with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine.  Any interested party that files a challenge shall specify with particularity which sites or elements of the municipal fair share plan do not comply with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) or the Mount Laurel doctrine, and the basis for alleging such non-compliance.  The program shall establish procedures to summarily dismiss any objection or challenge that does not meet these minimum standards.  For the purpose of efficiency, the program shall, in its own discretion, permit multiple challenges to the same municipal housing element and fair share plan to be consolidated.  If a municipalitys fair share plan and housing element is not challenged on or before August 31, 2025, then the program shall 1apply an objective standard to conduct a limited1 review 1of1 the fair share plan and housing element for consistency and to determine whether it 1enables the municipality to satisfy the fair share obligation, applies compliant mechanisms, meets the threshold requirements for rental and family units, does not exceed limits on other unit or category types, and1 is compliant with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine 1[, and] .  The program shall1 issue a compliance certification unless these objective standards are not met.  The program shall facilitate communication between the municipality and any interested parties for a challenge, and provide the municipality until December 31, 2025 to commit to revising its fair share plan and housing element in compliance with the changes requested in the challenge, or provide an explanation as to why it will not make all of the requested changes, or both.  Upon resolution of a challenge, the program shall issue compliance certification, conditioned on the municipalitys commitment, as necessary, to revise its fair share plan and housing element in accordance with the resolution of the challenge.  The program may also terminate immunity if it finds that the municipality is not determined to come into constitutional compliance at any point in the process.  If by December 31, 2025, the municipality and any interested party that filed a response have resolved the issues raised in the response through agreement or withdrawal of the filing, then the program shall review the fair share plan and housing element for consistency and to determine whether it is compliant with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine, and issue a compliance certification unless these objective standards are not met.  For the fifth round, and each subsequent new round of housing obligations, the deadline established in this subparagraph for an interested party to file a challenge shall be August 31, and for the municipality to revise its housing element and fair share plan in response, shall be December 31, of the year of the beginning of the new round. (c) For the fourth round of affordable housing obligations, the implementing ordinances and resolutions, proposed pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, and incorporating any changes from the program, shall be adopted on or before March 15, 2026.  For the fifth round, and each subsequent new round of housing obligations, the deadline established in this subparagraph for the implementing ordinances and resolutions shall be on March 15 of the year following the beginning of the new round.  After adoption of the implementing ordinances and resolutions by the municipality, the municipality shall immediately file the ordinances and resolutions with the program through the programs Internet website.  Failure to meet the March 15 deadline shall result in the municipality losing immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation. (d) The program may permit a municipality that still has a remaining dispute by interested parties to retain immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation into the year following the year in which a new round begins if the program, or county level housing judge, determines that the municipality has been unable to resolve the issues disputed despite being determined to come into constitutional compliance.  The Administrative Director of the Courts shall develop procedures to enable a county level housing judge to resolve this dispute over the issuance of compliance certification through a summary proceeding in Superior Court following the year in which the new round begins.  A judge shall be permitted to serve as a county level housing judge for more than one county in the same vicinage.  The pendency of such a dispute shall not stay the deadline for adoption of implementing ordinances and resolutions pursuant to this paragraph.  1The implementing ordinances and resolutions adopted prior to the resolution of the dispute may be subject to changes to reflect the results of the dispute.  As an alternative to adopting the implementing ordinances and resolutions by the March 15 deadline, a municipality involved in a continuing dispute over the issuance of compliance certification may adopt a binding resolution by this date to commit to adopting the implementing ordinances and resolutions following resolution of the dispute, with necessary adjustments to reflect the resolution of the dispute.1 (e) Once a municipality has received a compliance certification or otherwise has had its fair share obligation and housing element and fair share plan finally determined via judgment of repose or other judgment, the municipality shall make the municipalitys fair share plan and housing element, as well as any subsequently adopted implementing ordinances and resolutions, or amendments thereto, available to the department and the program for publication on the departments and programs respective Internet websites. (3) (a)  If a municipality fails to 1materially1 adhere to any of the deadlines established in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection due to circumstances beyond the control of the municipality, including but not limited to an inability to meet a deadline due to an extreme weather event, then the program, or the county level housing judge, in accordance with court rules, may permit a municipality to have a grace period to come into compliance with the timeline, the length of which, and effect of which on later deadlines, shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. (b) A municipality that has not adopted and published a binding resolution pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or that has not adopted and filed a housing element and fair share plan pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection may seek compliance certification by filing an action pursuant to section 13 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-313), provided that any 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation filed by a plaintiff against such a municipality prior to such time may proceed notwithstanding such filing.  In a municipality that has adopted and published a binding resolution pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and has adopted and filed a housing element and fair share plan pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a court shall not 1[grant a builders remedy to a plaintiff in] consider1 exclusionary zoning litigation during the timeframe after the timely submission of a binding resolution or fair share plan and housing element of a municipality, or both, and before a challenge is submitted, or during the timeframe of a challenge that is pending resolution with the program pursuant to this subsection.  A court may 1[grant a builders remedy to a plaintiff in] consider1 exclusionary zoning litigation after such timeframe upon a finding that the municipality: (i) is determined to be constitutionally noncompliant with its responsibilities pursuant to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) or is participating in the program in bad faith; (ii) has failed to meet the deadlines established pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); or (iii) has, after receiving compliance certification, failed to comply with the terms of that certification by not actually allowing for the development of the affordable housing as provided for in its fair share plan and housing element through actions, omissions, or both, of a municipality or its subordinate boards. (c) All parties shall bear their own fees and costs in proceedings before the program. (d) A determination by the program as to the present and prospective need obligation or as to issuance of compliance certification pursuant to this section shall be considered a final decision, subject to appellate review pursuant to the procedures set forth in subparagraph (c) of paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section. (e) A municipality shall not be deemed out of compliance with the deadlines of P.L. , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or lose immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation, due to a failure by the program to promptly maintain and update its Internet website, or other operational failure of the program. 1g.  The program shall be made a party to, and shall be responsible for defending its issuance of compliance certification in, any litigation alleging that, despite the issuance of compliance certification, a municipalitys fair share obligation, fair share plan, housing element, or ordinances implementing the fair share plan or housing element are not in compliance with the Mount Laurel doctrine.1 4. Section 13 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-313) is amended to read as follows: 13. a.  [A] If a municipality [which] has [filed a housing element may, at any time during a two-year period following the filing of the housing element, petition the council for a substantive certification of its element and ordinances or] adopted a housing element and fair share plan pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), but has failed to satisfy the June 30 deadline established pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection f. of section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), for any round of affordable housing obligations, the municipality may request and be provided with a grace period pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection f. of section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), if authorized by the program or county level housing judge, as determined by the rules of court.  If a municipality that has not satisfied this June 30 deadline is not provided with a grace period, the municipality may institute an action for declaratory judgment granting it repose in the Superior Court [, but in no event shall a grant of substantive certification extend beyond a 10-year period starting on the date the municipality files its housing element with the council] for the 10-year period constituting the current round of fair share obligations.  The municipality shall publish notice of its [petition] filing of a declaratory judgment action in a newspaper of general circulation within the municipality and county and shall make available to the public information on the element and ordinances by submitting such information to the program to be published on the Internet website of the program in accordance with [such procedures as the council shall establish.  The council shall also establish a procedure for providing public notice of each petition which it receives] section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b. [Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, a municipality which filed a housing element prior to the effective date of P.L.1990, c.121, shall be permitted to petition for substantive certification at any time within two years following that filing, or within one year following the effective date of P.L.1990, c.121, whichever shall result in permitting the municipality the longer period of time within which to petition.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill) [The Council shall establish procedures for] c.  (1)  A municipality or other interested party may file an action through the program seeking a realistic opportunity review [at the midpoint of the certification period and shall provide for notice to the public] at the midpoint of the certification period and shall provide for notice to the public, including a realistic opportunity review of any inclusionary development site in the housing element and fair share plan that has not received preliminary site plan approval prior to the midpoint of the 10-year round.  If such an action is initiated by a municipality, the municipality 1[shall] may1 propose one or more alternative sites with an accompanying development plan or plans that provide a realistic opportunity for the same number of affordable units and is otherwise in compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine, provided that if the facts demonstrate that the municipality or its subordinate boards have prevented the site from receiving site plan approval, then the program shall reject the municipalitys challenge. (2) Any party may file a request for information from the program regarding the progress of development at any inclusionary development site in the housing element and fair share plan of a municipality, or at any alternative site proposed by the municipality.  The program may respond to a request independently or in coordination with the department. (cf: P.L.2001, c.435, s.5) 5. (New section)  a.  There is established an Affordable Housing Dispute Resolution Program that shall have the purpose of efficiently resolving disputes involving the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), to consist of an odd number of members, of at least three and no more than seven members who shall lead the administration of the program.  The 1[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court] Administrative Director of the Courts1 shall update the assignment of designated Mount Laurel judges to indicate which current or retired and on recall judges of the Superior Court shall serve as members, within 1[40] 601 days following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The 1[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court] Administrative Director of the Courts1 may appoint other qualified experts as members if sufficient current and retired judges are unavailable.  The 1[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court] Administrative Director of the Courts1 shall take into consideration in making such appointments experience in the employment of alternative dispute resolution methods and in relevant subject matter. b. The 1[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court] Administrative Director of the Courts1 shall designate a member to serve as chair.  The 1[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court] Administrative Director of the Courts1 shall make new appointments as needs arise for new appointments. c. The program, in its discretion and in accordance with Rules of Court, may consult or employ the services of one or more special masters or staff to assist it in rendering determinations, resolving disputes, and facilitating communication as required by subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of subsection f. of section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  In addition, the program may incorporate any existing or newly established court mediation or alternative dispute resolution process to assist the program in resolving disputes and facilitating communication among municipalities and interested parties. d. The Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish a filing system via an Internet website in which the public is able to access, without cost, filings made pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and such other related filings as the Administrative Director of the Courts may include on the filing system. e. The Administrative Director of the Courts may assign additional responsibilities to the program for resolving disputes arising out of or related to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). f. The Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish procedures for the purpose of efficiently resolving disputes involving the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), for circumstances in which the program is unable to address the dispute within the time limitations established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  As a part of the procedures established pursuant to this section, in order to facilitate an appropriate level of localized control of affordable housing decisions, for each vicinage, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall designate a Superior Court judge who sits within the vicinage, or a retired judge who, during the judges tenure as a judge, served within the vicinage, to serve as county level housing judge to resolve disputes over the compliance, of fair share plans and housing elements of municipalities within their designated county or counties, with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), as well as disputes that arise with respect to ongoing compliance or noncompliance with obligations created by fair share plans, housing elements, and the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.).  A judge shall be permitted to serve as a county level housing judge for more than one county in the same vicinage. g. The Administrative Director of the Courts shall promulgate, maintain, and apply a Code of Ethics that is modeled upon the Code of Judicial Conduct of the American Bar Association, as amended and adopted by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, and may establish additional, more restrictive ethical standards in order to meet the specific needs of the program, and of county level housing judges. 6.  (New section)  a. Municipal present need for each 10-year round of affordable housing obligations shall be determined by estimating the deficient housing units occupied by low- and moderate-income households in the region, following a methodology similar to the methodology used to determine third round municipal present need, through the use of most recent datasets made available through the federal decennial census and the American Community Survey. b.  For the purpose of determining regional need for the 10-year round of low- and moderate-income housing obligations, running from July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2035, and each 10-year round thereafter: (1)  The regions of the State shall be comprised as follows: (a)  Region 1 shall consist of the counties of Bergen, Hudson, Passaic, and Sussex; (b)  Region 2 shall consist of the counties of Essex, Morris, Union, and Warren; (c)  Region 3 shall consist of the counties of Hunterdon, Middlesex, and Somerset; (d)  Region 4 shall consist of the counties of Mercer, Monmouth, and Ocean; (e)  Region 5 shall consist of the counties of Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester; and (f)  Region 6 shall consist of the counties of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, and Salem. (2)  Regional prospective need for a 10-year round of low- and moderate-income housing obligations shall be determined through the calculation provided in this subsection.  Projected household change for a 10-year round in a region shall be estimated by establishing the household change experienced in the region between the most recent federal decennial census, and the second-most recent federal decennial census.  This household change, if positive, shall be divided by 2.5 to estimate the number of low- and moderate-income homes needed to address low- and moderate-income household change in the region, and to determine the regional prospective need for a 10-year round of low- and moderate-income housing obligations.  If household change is zero or negative, the number of low- and moderate-income homes needed to address low- and moderate-income household change in the region and the regional prospective need shall be zero. 7. (New section)  a.  The present and prospective fair share obligation for low- and moderate-income housing for each municipality in the State shall be determined as described in this section.  In addition, the March 8, 2018 unpublished decision of the Superior Court, Law Division, Mercer County, In re Application of Municipality of Princeton shall be referenced as to datasets and methodologies that are not explicitly addressed by this section. These determinations of municipal present and prospective need shall be based on a determination of the present and prospective regional need for low- and moderate-income housing, established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  These calculations of municipal present and prospective need shall use necessary datasets that are updated to the greatest extent practicable. b. A municipalitys present need obligation shall be determined by estimating the existing deficient housing units currently occupied by low- and moderate-income households within the municipality, following a methodology comparable to the methodology used to determine third round present need, through the use of datasets made available through the federal decennial census and the American Community Survey. c. A municipalitys prospective fair share obligation of the regional prospective need for the upcoming 10-year round shall be determined in accordance with this subsection: (1) If a municipality is a qualified urban aid municipality, the municipality shall be exempt from responsibility for any fair share prospective need obligation for the upcoming 10-year round.  For the purposes of this section, a municipality is a qualified urban aid municipality if the municipality, as of July 1 of the year prior to the beginning of a new round, is designated by the department, pursuant to P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178 et seq.), to receive State aid, and the municipality meets at least one of the following criteria: (a) The ratio of substandard existing deficient housing units currently occupied by low- and moderate-income households within the municipality, compared to all existing housing in the municipality, is greater than the equivalent ratio in the region; (b) The municipality has a population density greater than 10,000 persons per square mile of land area; or (c) The municipality has a population density of more than 6,000, but less than 10,000 persons per square mile of land area, and less than five percent vacant parcels not used as farmland, as measured by the average of: (i) The number of vacant land parcels in the municipality as a percentage of the total number of parcels in the municipality; and (ii) The valuation of vacant land in the municipality as a percentage of total valuations in the municipality. (2) A municipalitys equalized nonresidential valuation factor shall be determined.  To determine this factor, the changes in nonresidential property valuations in the municipality, since the beginning of the round preceding the round being calculated, shall be calculated using data published by the Division of Local Government Services in the department.  The change in the municipalitys nonresidential valuations shall be divided by the regional total change in nonresidential valuations to determine the municipalitys share of the regional change as the equalized nonresidential valuation factor. (3) A municipalitys income capacity factor shall be determined.  This factor shall be determined by calculating the average of the following measures: (a) The municipal share of the regional sum of the differences between the median municipal household income, according to the most recent American Community Survey Five-Year Estimates, and an income floor of $100 below the lowest median household income in the region; and (b) The municipal share of the regional sum of the differences between the median municipal household incomes and an income floor of $100 below the lowest median household income in the region, weighted by the number of the households in the municipality. (4) A municipalitys land capacity factor shall be determined.  This factor shall be determined by estimating the area of developable 1[and redevelopable]1 land in the municipalitys boundaries, and regional boundaries, that may accommodate development through the use of the "land use / land cover data" most recently published by the Department of Environmental Protection, and weighing such land based on the planning area type in which such land is located.  After the weighing factors are applied, the sum of the total developable 1[and redevelopable]1 land area that may accommodate development in the municipality, and in the region shall be determined.  The municipalitys share of its regions developable 1[and redevelopable]1 land shall be its land capacity factor. Developable 1[and redevelopable]1 land that may accommodate development shall be weighted based on the planning area type in which such land is located, as designated pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.), P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.), or P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et seq.), as follows: (a) Planning Area 1 (Metropolitan) shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (b) Planning Area 2 (Suburban) shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (c) Planning Area 3 (Fringe) shall have a weighting factor of 0.5; (d) Planning Area 4 (Rural) shall have a weighting factor of 0.0; (e) Planning Area 5 (Environmentally Sensitive) shall have a weighting factor of 0.0; (f) Centers in Planning Areas 1 and 2 shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (g) Centers in Planning Areas 3, 4, and 5 shall have a weighting factor of 0.5; (h) Pinelands Regional Growth Area shall have a weighting factor of 0.5; (i) Pinelands Town shall have a weighting factor of 0.5; (j) All other Pinelands shall have a weighting factor of 0.0; (k) Meadowlands shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (l) Meadowlands Center shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (m) Highlands Preservation Area shall have a weighting factor of 0.0; (n) Highlands Planning Area Existing Community Zone, opted in municipality by May 1, 2022 shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (o) Highlands Planning Area, State-designated sewer service area, municipality not opted in by May 1, 2022, shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; and (p) All other Highlands Planning Areas shall have a weighting factor of 0.0. (5) The equalized nonresidential valuation factor, income capacity factor, and land capacity factor, determined in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection, shall be averaged to yield the municipalitys average allocation factor for distributing gross regional prospective need to the municipality.  The regional prospective need shall then be multiplied by the municipalitys average allocation factor to determine the municipalitys gross prospective need for the 10-year round. (6) Secondary sources of supply and demand shall be adjusted for by first calculating demolitions of low- and moderate-income housing, and housing creation through low- and moderate-income residential conversions.  A municipalitys share of low- and moderate-income conversions shall then be subtracted from the sum of each municipalitys allocated share of gross prospective need and demolitions of low- and moderate-income housing. 8.  Section 4 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-56) is amended to read as follows: 4.  a.  Upon failure to perform any obligation of a residential mortgage by the residential mortgage debtor and before any residential mortgage lender may accelerate the maturity of any residential mortgage obligation and commence any foreclosure or other legal action to take possession of the residential property which is the subject of the mortgage, the residential mortgage lender shall give a notice of intention, which shall include a notice of the right to cure the default as provided in section 5 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-57), at least 30 days, but not more than 180 days, in advance of such action as provided in this section, to the residential mortgage debtor, and, if the mortgage is secured by a residence for which a restriction on affordability was recorded in the county in which the property is located, the clerk of the municipality in which the subject property is located, the municipal housing liaison, if one has been appointed by the municipality [pursuant to the regulations of the Council on Affordable Housing, and the Commissioner of Community Affairs]. For the purposes of this section, "restriction on affordability" means any conditions recorded with a mortgage or a deed which would limit the sale of such property to income qualified households pursuant to the rules adopted to effectuate the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). b.    Notice of intention to take action as specified in subsection a. of this section shall be in writing, provided to the Department of Community Affairs in accordance with subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2019, c.134 (C.46:10B-49.2), sent to the debtor by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at the debtor's last known address, and, if different, to the address of the property which is the subject of the residential mortgage.  The notice is deemed to have been effectuated on the date the notice is delivered in person or mailed to the party. c.    The written notice shall clearly and conspicuously state in a manner calculated to make the debtor aware of the situation: (1)   the particular obligation or real estate security interest; (2)   the nature of the default claimed; (3)   the right of the debtor to cure the default as provided in section 5 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-57); (4)   what performance, including what sum of money, if any, and interest, shall be tendered to cure the default as of the date specified under paragraph (5) of this subsection c.; (5)   the date by which the debtor shall cure the default to avoid initiation of foreclosure proceedings, which date shall not be less than 30 days after the date the notice is effective, and the name and address and phone number of a person to whom the payment or tender shall be made; (6)   that if the debtor does not cure the default by the date specified under paragraph (5) of this subsection c., the lender may take steps to terminate the debtor's ownership in the property by commencing a foreclosure suit in a court of competent jurisdiction; (7)   that if the lender takes the steps indicated pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection c., a debtor shall still have the right to cure the default pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-57), but that the debtor shall be responsible for the lender's court costs and attorneys' fees in an amount not to exceed that amount permitted pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey; (8)   the right, if any, of the debtor to transfer the real estate to another person subject to the security interest and that the transferee may have the right to cure the default as provided in P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-53 et seq.), subject to the mortgage documents; (9)   that the debtor is advised to seek counsel from an attorney of the debtor's own choosing concerning the debtor's residential mortgage default situation, and that, if the debtor is unable to obtain an attorney, the debtor may communicate with the New Jersey Bar Association or Lawyer Referral Service in the county in which the residential property securing the mortgage loan is located; and that, if the debtor is unable to afford an attorney, the debtor may communicate with the Legal Services Office in the county in which the property is located; (10)  the possible availability of financial assistance for curing a default from programs operated by the State or federal government or nonprofit organizations, if any, as identified by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance and, if the property is subject to restrictions on affordability, the address and phone number of the municipal affordable housing liaison and of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.  This requirement shall be satisfied by attaching a list of such programs promulgated by the commissioner; (11)  the name and address of the lender and the telephone number of a representative of the lender whom the debtor may contact if the debtor disagrees with the lender's assertion that a default has occurred or the correctness of the mortgage lender's calculation of the amount required to cure the default; (12)  that if the lender takes the steps indicated pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection, the debtor has the option to participate in the Foreclosure Mediation Program following the filing of a mortgage foreclosure complaint by initiating mediation pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 4 of P.L.2019, c.64 (C.2A:50-77). Notice of the option to participate in the Foreclosure Mediation Program shall adhere to the requirements of section 3 of P.L.2019, c.64 (C.2A:50-76) and any court rules, procedures, or guidelines adopted by the Supreme Court; (13)  that the debtor is entitled to housing counseling, at no cost to the debtor, through the Foreclosure Mediation Program established by the New Jersey Judiciary, including information on how to contact the program; (14)  that if the property which is the subject of the mortgage has more than one dwelling unit but less than five, one of which is occupied by the debtor or a member of the debtor's immediate family as the debtor's or member's residence at the time the loan is originated, and is not properly maintained and meets the necessary conditions for receivership eligibility, established pursuant to section 4 of the "Multifamily Housing Preservation and Receivership Act," P.L.2003, c.295 (C.2A:42-117), the residential mortgage lender shall file an order to show cause to appoint a receiver; and (15)  that the lender is either licensed in accordance with the "New Jersey Residential Mortgage Lending Act," sections 1 through 39 of P.L.2009, c.53 (C.17:11C-51 through C.17:11C-89) or exempt from licensure under the act in accordance with applicable law. d.    The notice of intention to foreclose required to be provided pursuant to this section shall not be required if the debtor has voluntarily surrendered the property which is the subject of the residential mortgage. e.     The duty of the lender under this section to serve notice of intention to foreclose is independent of any other duty to give notice under the common law, principles of equity, State or federal statute, or rule of court and of any other right or remedy the debtor may have as a result of the failure to give such notice. f.     Compliance with this section and subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2019, c.134 (C.46:10B-49.2) shall be set forth in the pleadings of any legal action referred to in this section. If the plaintiff in any complaint seeking foreclosure of a residential mortgage alleges that the property subject to the residential mortgage has been abandoned or voluntarily surrendered, the plaintiff shall plead the specific facts upon which this allegation is based. g.    If more than 180 days have elapsed since the date the notice required pursuant to this section is sent, and any foreclosure or other legal action to take possession of the residential property which is the subject of the mortgage has not yet been commenced, the lender shall send a new written notice at least 30 days, but not more than 180 days, in advance of that action. h.    If the property which is the subject of the notice of intention to foreclose has more than one dwelling unit but less than five, one of which is occupied by the debtor or a member of the debtor's immediate family as the debtor's or member's residence at the time the loan is originated, and is not properly maintained and meets the necessary conditions for receivership eligibility, established pursuant to section 4 of the "Multifamily Housing Preservation and Receivership Act," P.L.2003, c.295 (C.2A:42-117), the residential mortgage lender shall file an order to show cause to appoint a receiver.

(cf: P.L.1997, c.411, s.11) 13.  Section 33 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.2) is amended to read as follows: 33.  The Legislature finds and declares: a.  The collection of development fees from builders of residential and non-residential properties has been authorized by the court through the powers [delegated to the Council on Affordable Housing] established pursuant to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.).  Due to the Legislatures determination that the role of the Council on Affordable Housing has not developed in practice as intended, the Legislature further determines that authority relating to rulemaking on the collection of residential and non-residential development fees is appropriately delegated to the Department of Community Affairs, given the departments existing roles related to local government finance and the funding and financing of affordable housing throughout the State. b.  New Jersey's land resources are becoming more scarce, while its redevelopment needs are increasing.  In order to balance the needs of developing and redeveloping communities, a reasonable method of providing for the housing needs of [low and moderate income] low-, moderate-, and [middle income] middle-income households, without mandating the inclusion of housing in every non-residential project, must be established. c.  A Statewide non-residential development fee program, which permits municipalities [under the council's jurisdiction] that have obtained or are in the process of seeking compliance certification to retain these fees for use in the municipality will provide a fair and balanced funding method to address the State's affordable housing needs, while providing an incentive to all municipalities to [seek substantive] obtain compliance certification [from the council]. d.  Whereas, pursuant to P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-1 et seq.), organizations are directed to invest in the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority to ensure that the development of housing for families of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income shall be provided.  The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority [, in consultation with the council,] shall work to effectuate the purpose and intent of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). e.  [The "Statewide Non-Residential Development Fee Act," sections 32 through 38 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.1 through C.40:55D-8.7), prohibits municipalities from imposing their own fees to fund affordable housing on non-residential development, and P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-489a et al.) is not intended to alter this underlying policy.] Deleted by amendment P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill) f.  The negative impact of a State policy that over-relies on a municipal fee structure and of State programs that require a municipality to impose fees and charges on developers must be balanced against any public good expected from such regulation.  It is undisputable that the charging of fees at high levels dissuades commerce from locating within a State or municipality or locality and halts non-residential and residential development, and these ill effects directly increase the overall costs of housing, and could impede the constitutional obligation to provide for a realistic opportunity for housing for families at all income levels. (cf: P.L.2009, c.90, s.36) 14.  Section 34 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.3) is amended to read as follows: 34.  As used in sections 32 through 38 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.1 through C.40:55D-8.7): "Construction" means new construction and additions, but does not include alterations, reconstruction, renovations, and repairs as those terms are defined under the State Uniform Construction Code promulgated pursuant to the "State Uniform Construction Code Act," P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.).

"Mixed use development" means any development which includes both a non-residential development component and a residential development component, and shall include developments for which (1) there is a common developer for both the residential development component and the non-residential development component, provided that for purposes of this definition, multiple persons and entities may be considered a common developer if there is a contractual relationship among them obligating each entity to develop at least a portion of the residential or non-residential development, or both, or otherwise to contribute resources to the development; and (2) the residential and non-residential developments are located on the same lot or adjoining lots, including but not limited to lots separated by a street, a river, or another geographical feature.

"Spending plan" means a method of allocating funds collected and to be collected pursuant to an approved municipal development fee ordinance, or pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1 et al.) for the purpose of meeting the housing needs of low and moderate income individuals. "Treasurer" means the Treasurer of the State of New Jersey.

Section 11 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-311) is amended to read as follows: 11. a.  In adopting its housing element, the municipality may provide for its fair share of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing by means of any technique or combination of techniques which provide a realistic opportunity for the provision of the fair share.  The housing element shall contain an analysis demonstrating that it will provide such a realistic opportunity, and the municipality shall establish that its land use and other relevant ordinances have been revised to incorporate the provisions for [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing.  In preparing the housing element, the municipality shall consider the following techniques for providing [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing within the municipality, as well as such other appropriate techniques as have been established through applicable precedent and may be [published by the council or proposed] employed by the municipality: (1)  Rezoning for densities necessary to assure the economic viability of any inclusionary developments, either through mandatory set-asides or density bonuses, as may be necessary to meet all or part of the municipality's fair share in accordance with [the regulations of the council and] the provisions of subsection h. of this section; (2)  Determination of the total residential zoning necessary to assure that the municipality's fair share is achieved; (3)  Determination of measures that the municipality will take to assure that [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income units remain affordable to [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income households for an appropriate period of not less than [six years] the period required by the regulations adopted by the Department of Community Affairs pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321); (4)  A plan for infrastructure expansion and rehabilitation and conversion or redevelopment of unused or underutilized real property, including existing structures, if necessary to assure the achievement of the municipality's fair share of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing; (5)  Donation or use of municipally owned land or land condemned by the municipality for purposes of providing [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing; (6)  Tax abatements for purposes of providing [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing; (7)  Utilization of funds obtained from any State or federal subsidy toward the construction of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing; (8)  Utilization of municipally generated funds toward the construction of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing; and (9)  The purchase of privately owned real property used for residential purposes at the value of all liens secured by the property, excluding any tax liens, notwithstanding that the total amount of debt secured by liens exceeds the appraised value of the property, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Community Affairs pursuant to subsection b. of section 41 of P.L.2000, c.126 (C.52:27D-311.2). b.   The municipality may provide for a phasing schedule for the achievement of its fair share of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing. c.   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2008, c.46) d.   Nothing in P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) shall require a municipality to raise or expend municipal revenues in order to provide [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing. e.   When a municipality's housing element includes the provision of rental housing units in a community residence for the developmentally disabled , for the mentally ill, or for persons with head injuries, as those terms are defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, c.448 (C.30:11B-2), or in transitional housing, which will be affordable to persons of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income, and for which adequate measures to retain such affordability pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of this section are included in the housing element, those housing units shall be fully credited [as permitted under the rules of the council] towards the fulfillment of the municipality's fair share of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing.  A municipality shall not credit transitional housing units towards more than 10 percent of the municipalitys fair share obligation. f.    It having been determined by the Legislature that the provision of housing under P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) is a public purpose, a municipality or municipalities may utilize public monies to make donations, grants or loans of public funds for the rehabilitation of deficient housing units and the provision of new or substantially rehabilitated housing for [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income persons, providing that any private advantage is incidental. g. A municipality [which] that has received [substantive certification from the council] approval of its housing element and fair share plan for the current round, and [which] that has actually effected the construction of the affordable housing units it is obligated to provide, may amend its affordable housing element or zoning ordinances without [the approval of the council] losing immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation. h.   Whenever affordable housing units are proposed to be provided through an inclusionary development, a municipality shall provide, through its zoning powers, incentives to the developer, which shall include increased densities and reduced costs [, in accordance with the regulations of the council and this subsection]. i.    [The council, upon the application of a] A municipality and a developer [,] may [approve] request a modification of a compliance certification involving reduced affordable housing set-asides or increased densities to ensure the economic feasibility of an inclusionary development , if any such application demonstrates how any shortfall in meeting the municipal fair share obligation will then be addressed.  Such a request may be granted only if the municipality and developer have demonstrated that the project has been impacted by market conditions beyond their reasonable control. j.    A municipality may enter into an agreement with a developer or residential development owner to provide a preference for affordable housing to [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as defined in section 1 of P.L.1963, c.171 (C.54:4-8.10), of up to 50 percent of the affordable units in that particular project.  This preference shall be established in the applicant selection process for available affordable units so that applicants who are veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as referenced in this subsection, and who apply within 90 days of the initial marketing period shall receive preference for the rental of the agreed-upon percentage of affordable units. After the first 90 days of the initial 120-day marketing period, if any of those units subject to the preference remain available, then applicants from the general public shall be considered for occupancy.  Following the initial 120-day marketing period, previously qualified applicants and future qualified applicants who are veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as referenced in this subsection, shall be placed on a special waiting list as well as the general waiting list.  The veterans on the special waiting list shall be given preference for affordable units, as the units become available, whenever the percentage of preference-occupied units falls below the agreed upon percentage.  Any agreement to provide affordable housing preferences for veterans pursuant to this subsection shall not affect a municipality's ability to receive credit for the unit [from the council, or its successor]. k. In the fourth round, and in subsequent rounds of affordable housing obligations, a municipality shall be able to receive one credit against its affordable housing obligation for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing, and shall not receive bonus credit for any particular type of low- or moderate-income housing, unless authority to obtain bonus credit is expressly provided pursuant to this section, or other sections of the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.).  A municipality shall not receive more than one type of bonus credit for any unit, and a municipality shall not be permitted to satisfy more than 25 percent of its prospective need obligation in the fourth round or any subsequent round through the use of bonus credits.  This subsection shall not be construed to limit the ability of a municipality to receive a unit of credit for a low- or moderate-income housing unit that is subject to affordability controls that are scheduled to expire, but are extended 1[in accordance with the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency] pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321)1, to the extent that this affordability control extension would otherwise generate this credit.  As a part of a fair share plan and housing element adopted pursuant to subsection f. of section 3 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), a municipality shall: (1) receive one unit of credit and one bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing for individuals with special needs or permanent supportive housing, as those terms are defined in section 2 of P.L. 2004, c.70 (C.34:1B-21.24); (2) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for each low- or moderate-income ownership unit created in partnership sponsorship with a non-profit housing developer; (3) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing located within a one-half mile radius, or one-mile radius for projects located in a Garden State Growth Zone, as defined in section 2 of P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-243), surrounding a New Jersey Transit Corporation, Port Authority Transit Corporation, or Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation rail, bus, or ferry station, including all light rail stations.  For the purpose of this subparagraph, the distance from the bus, rail, or ferry station to a housing unit shall be measured from the closest point on the outer perimeter of the station, including any associated park-and-ride lot, to the closest point of the housing project property; (4) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for a unit of age-restricted housing, provided that a bonus credit for age-restricted housing shall not be applied to more than 1[15] 101 percent of the units of age-restricted housing constructed in compliance with the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency in a municipality that count towards the municipalitys affordable housing obligation for any single 10-year round of affordable housing obligations; (5) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income family housing with at least three bedrooms above the minimum number required by the bedroom distribution 1[in a given development] .  This bonus credit shall be calculated by taking into account the full municipal fair share plan and housing element, and the number of units with at least three bedrooms required for projects satisfying the minimum 50 percent family housing requirements.  A municipality shall receive the bonus credit pursuant to this paragraph for each unit with at least three bedrooms that are above the minimum number required for the bedroom distribution determined pursuant to the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency1; (6) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for a unit of low- or moderate-income housing constructed on land that is or was previously developed and utilized for retail, office, or commercial space; (7) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for each existing low- or moderate-income rental housing unit for which affordability controls are extended for a new term of affordability, in compliance with the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, and the municipality contributes funding towards the costs necessary for this preservation; (8) receive one unit of credit and 1[one-half] one1 bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing in a 100 percent affordable housing project 1[toward] for1 which the municipality 1[either contributes property without which the project would not be feasible, or makes contributions from the municipal affordable housing trust fund that cover no less than 10 percent of the project cost] contributes toward the costs of the project. This contribution may consist of: (a) real property donations that enable siting and construction of the project; or (b) contributions from the municipal affordable housing trust fund in support of the project, if the contribution consists of no less than three percent of the project cost1; 1[and]1 (9) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for each unit of very low-income housing for families above the 13 percent of units required to be reserved for very low-income housing pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1).  1In accordance with section 7 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1), a municipality shall not be required to provide that a specific percentage of the units in any specific project be reserved as very low-income housing in order to obtain this bonus credit, and the 13 percent level, for the purpose of bonus credits, shall be calculated against the full prospective need obligation provided pursuant to the fair share plan; and (10) receive one unit of credit and one bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing created by transforming an existing rental or ownership unit from a market rate unit to an affordable housing unit.  A municipality may only rely on this bonus credit as part of its fair share plan and housing element if the municipality demonstrates that a commitment to follow through with this market to affordable agreement has been made and: (a) this agreement has been signed by the property owner; or (b) the municipality has obtained ownership of the property.1 l. A municipality may not satisfy more than 1[25] 301 percent of the affordable housing units, exclusive of any bonus credits, to address its prospective need affordable housing obligation through the creation of age-restricted housing.  A municipality shall satisfy a minimum of 50 percent of the actual affordable housing units, exclusive of any bonus credits, created to address its prospective need affordable housing obligation through the creation of housing available to families with children and otherwise in compliance with the requirements and controls established pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321).  A municipality shall satisfy a minimum of 25 percent of the actual affordable housing units, exclusive of any bonus credits, to address its prospective need affordable housing obligation, through rental housing, including at least half of that number available to families with children.  All units referred to in this section shall otherwise be in compliance  with the requirements and controls established pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321). m. All parties shall be entitled to rely upon regulations on municipal credits, adjustments, and compliance mechanisms adopted by the Council on Affordable Housing unless those regulations are contradicted by statute, including but not limited to P.L.    c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or binding court decisions.

CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Assembly Appropriations Committee on February 8, 2024, with amendments. An Act concerning affordable housing, including administration and municipal obligations, amending, supplementing, and repealing various parts of the statutory law, and making an appropriation. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. Section 2 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-302) is amended to read as follows: 2.   The Legislature finds that: a.   The New Jersey Supreme Court, through its rulings in [South] Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 67 N.J. 151 (1975) and [South] Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 92 N.J. 158 (1983), has determined that every municipality in a growth area has a constitutional obligation to provide through its land use regulations a realistic opportunity for a fair share of its region's present and prospective needs for housing for [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income families. b.   In the second Mount Laurel ruling, the Supreme Court stated that the determination of the methods for satisfying this constitutional obligation "is better left to the Legislature," that the court has "always preferred legislative to judicial action in their field," and that the judicial role in upholding the Mount Laurel doctrine "could decrease as a result of legislative and executive action." c.   The interest of all citizens, including [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income families in need of affordable housing, and the needs of the workforce, would be best served by a comprehensive planning and implementation response to this constitutional obligation. d.   There are a number of essential ingredients to a comprehensive planning and implementation response, including the establishment of reasonable fair share housing guidelines and standards, the initial determination of fair share by officials at the municipal level and the preparation of a municipal housing element, State review of the local fair share study and housing element, and continuous State funding for [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing to replace the federal housing subsidy programs which have been almost completely eliminated. e.   The State can maximize the number of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income units provided in New Jersey by allowing its municipalities to adopt appropriate phasing schedules for meeting their fair share, so long as the municipalities permit a timely achievement of an appropriate fair share of the regional need for [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing as required by the Mt. Laurel I and II opinions and other relevant court decisions. f.    The State can also maximize the number of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income units by creating new affordable housing and by rehabilitating existing, but substandard, housing in the State.  Because the Legislature has determined, pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1 et al.), that it is no longer appropriate or in harmony with the Mount Laurel doctrine to permit the transfer of the fair share obligations among municipalities within a housing region, it is necessary and appropriate to create a new program to create new affordable housing and to foster the rehabilitation of existing, but substandard, housing. g.   Since the urban areas are vitally important to the State, construction, conversion and rehabilitation of housing in our urban centers should be encouraged. However, the provision of housing in urban areas must be balanced with the need to provide housing throughout the State for the free mobility of citizens. h.   The Supreme Court of New Jersey in its Mount Laurel decisions demands that municipal land use regulations affirmatively afford a [reasonable] realistic opportunity for a variety and choice of housing including low and moderate cost housing, to meet the needs of people desiring to live there.  While provision for the actual construction of that housing by municipalities is not required, they are encouraged but not mandated to expend their own resources to help provide [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing. i.    [Certain amendments to the enabling act of the Council on Affordable Housing are necessary to provide guidance to the council to ensure consistency with the legislative intent, while at the same time clarifying the limitations of the council in its rulemaking.  Although the court has remarked in several decisions that the Legislature has granted the council considerable deference in its rulemaking, the Legislature retains its power and obligation to clarify and amend the enabling act from which the council derives its rulemaking power, from time to time, in order to better guide the council.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) j.    The Legislature finds that the use of regional contribution agreements, which permits municipalities to transfer a certain portion of their fair share housing obligation outside of the municipal borders, should no longer be utilized as a mechanism for the creation of affordable housing [by the council]. k. The Legislature finds that the role of the Council on Affordable Housing, as intended in the original enactment of the "Fair Housing Act," has not developed in practice as was intended in the legislation. l. The councils inability to function ultimately led the Supreme Court in 2015 to order the temporary dissolution of the requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted prior to resolving affordable housing disputes before the court, and allowed the courts to resume their role as the forum of first resort for evaluating municipal compliance with Mount Laurel obligations pursuant to guidelines laid out by the Supreme Courts order. m. The Legislature finds that the councils inability to function led to a "gap period" that frustrated the intent of the Legislature and compliance with constitutional and statutory obligations, and that it is necessary to establish definitive deadlines for municipal action and any challenges to those actions to avoid such a "gap period" from being repeated in the future. n. The Legislature finds that although the court-led system that has developed since 2015 has resulted in a significant number of settlement agreements and increased production of affordable housing, the system could operate more expeditiously to produce affordable housing, and at a lower cost to all parties, if appropriate standards are established by the Legislature to be applied throughout the State including more clarity on calculation on fair share affordable housing obligations using transparent and established data sources to eliminate the lengthy and costly processes of determining those obligations that have characterized both the Council on Affordable Housing and court-led system. o. The Legislature determines that, considering the unique history of the "Fair Housing Act," the Council on Affordable Housing shall be abolished, and that, pursuant to the formulas and process established pursuant to sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), a municipality shall be authorized to seek approval of its fair share affordable housing obligation, adopted pursuant to binding resolution and then filed with the court, with the guidance of calculations published by the Department of Community Affairs, but that advocates for the low- and moderate-income households of the State shall be provided with an opportunity to contest the municipal determination. p. 1The Legislature declares that the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), as amended and supplemented by P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), is intended to implement the Mount Laurel doctrine, and that municipalities in compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) are also in compliance with the Mount Laurel doctrine. q.1  The Legislature finds that the population of persons aged 65 years and older in the State has grown from approximately 13 percent in 1990, to 17 percent in 2021, and that such growth, in conjunction with expected future growth, makes it appropriate for the Legislature to 1[continue to]1 allow up to 1[25] 301 percent of the units towards a municipalitys prospective affordable housing obligation to be satisfied through the creation of age-restricted housing. (cf: P.L.2008, c.46, s.4) 2. Section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304) is amended to read as follows: 4.

For the fourth round of affordable housing obligations, the department shall prepare and submit a report to the Governor, and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature providing a report on the calculations of regional need and municipal obligations for each region of the State 1[on or before August] within the earlier of seven months following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) or December1 1, 2024.  The department shall provide the report to each municipality in the State at the same time that it submits the report to the Governor and Legislature and shall also publish such report on the departments Internet website.  For the fifth round, and each subsequent new round of housing obligations, the department shall prepare and submit a report to each municipality in the State, the Governor, and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature on these calculations on or before August 1 of the year prior to the start of the new round and shall also publish such report on the departments Internet website.  For each 10-year round of housing obligations, a municipality may take into consideration the calculations in the report prepared by the department pursuant to this subsection in determining its present and prospective obligations. e. Nothing in the provisions of subsections c., d., or f. of this section shall be interpreted to render any calculation in a report by the department published pursuant to this section binding on any municipality or other entity, nor to render any failure by the department to timely conduct the calculations or publish a report required by this section to alter the deadlines or process set forth in this section.  The ultimate determination of a municipalitys present and prospective need shall be through the process as set forth below. f. (1)  (a)  With consideration of the calculations contained in the relevant report published by the department pursuant to this section, for each 10-year round of affordable housing obligations beginning with the fourth round, a municipality shall determine its present and prospective fair share obligation for affordable housing in accordance with the formulas established in sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) by resolution, which shall describe the basis for the municipalitys determination and bind the municipality to adopt a housing element and fair share plan pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection based on this determination as may be adjusted by the program as set forth in this subsection. (b) For the fourth round of affordable housing obligations, this determination of present and prospective fair share obligation shall be made by binding resolution no later than January 31, 2025.  After adoption of this binding resolution, the municipality shall file an action regarding the resolution with the program no later than 48 hours following adoption.  The resolution, along with the date of filing with the program, shall be published on the programs publicly accessible Internet website.  The municipality shall also publish the resolution on its publicly accessible Internet website, if the municipality maintains one.  If the municipality does not meet this deadline, it 1[immediately]1 shall lose immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation until such time as the municipality is determined to have come into compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine.  A determination of the municipalitys present and prospective obligation may be established before a county level housing judge as part of any resulting declaratory judgment action pursuant to section 13 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-313), as amended by P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or through 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation.  If the municipality meets this January 31 deadline, then the municipalitys determination of its obligation shall be established by default 1, and shall bear a presumption of validity1 beginning on March 1, 2025, as the municipalitys obligation for the fourth round, unless challenged by an interested party on or before February 28, 2025.  1The municipalitys determination of its fair share obligation shall have a presumption of validity, if established in accordance with sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), in any challenge initiated through the program.1  An interested party may file a challenge with the program, after adoption of the binding resolution and prior to March 1, 2025, alleging that the municipalitys determination of its present and prospective obligation does not comply with the requirements of sections 6 and 7 of P.L. , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  For the fifth round, and each subsequent new round of housing obligations, the deadlines established in this subparagraph shall be on the last day of January, the last day of February, and the first day of March, respectively, of the year of the start of each new round. (c) The Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish procedures for the program to consider a challenge and resolve a dispute initiated by an interested party pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this paragraph.  To resolve a challenge, the program shall apply an objective assessment standard to determine whether or not the municipalitys calculation of its obligation is compliant with the requirements of sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Any challenge must state with particularity how the municipal calculation fails to comply with sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and include the challengers own calculation of the fair share obligations in compliance with sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C. and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The program shall establish procedures to summarily dismiss any objection or challenge that does not meet these minimum standards.  For the purpose of efficiency, the program shall, in its own discretion, permit multiple challenges to the same municipal determination to be consolidated.  The programs approach to resolving a dispute may include: (i) a finding that the municipalitys determination of its present and prospective need obligation did not facially comply with the requirements of sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C. and C.        )  (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and thus the municipalitys immunity shall be revoked; (ii) an adjustment of the municipalitys determination of its present and prospective need obligation to comply with the requirements of sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) without revoking immunity; or (iii) a rejection of a challenge and affirm the municipalitys determination.  The decision shall be provided to the municipality and all parties that have filed challenges no later than March 31 of the year when the current round is expiring and the new round is beginning and concurrently posted on the programs Internet website.  The Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish procedures for any further appellate review of such determinations, and may establish an expedited process for consolidated review of any such challenges by the Supreme Court, provided that any party seeking appellate review shall not change the deadlines established for municipal filing of a housing element and fair share plan, and implementing ordinances. (2) (a)  A municipality shall adopt a housing element and fair share plan as provided for by the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), and propose drafts of the appropriate zoning and other ordinances and resolutions to implement its present and prospective obligation established in paragraph (1) of this subsection on or before June 30, 2025.  After adoption of the housing element and fair share plan, and the proposal of drafts of the appropriate zoning and other ordinances and resolutions, the municipality shall within 48 hours of adoption or by June 30, 2025, whichever is sooner, file the same with the program as part of the action initiated pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of this subsection through the programs Internet website.  Any municipality that does not do so by June 30, 2025, shall not retain immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation until such time as the municipality is determined to have come into compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine and shall be subject to review through the declaratory judgment process as established in paragraph (3) of this subsection.  As part of its housing element and fair share plan, the municipality shall include an assessment of the degree to which the municipality has met its fair share obligation from the prior rounds of affordable housing obligations as established by prior court approval, or approval by the council, and determine to what extent this obligation is unfulfilled or whether the municipality has credits in excess of its prior round obligations.  If a prior round obligation remains unfulfilled, or a municipality never received an approval from court or the council for any prior round, the municipality shall address such unfulfilled prior round obligation in its housing element and fair share plan.  Units included as part of the municipalitys unfulfilled prior round obligation shall not count towards the cap on units in the municipalitys prospective need obligation.  In addressing prior round obligations, the municipality shall retain any sites that, in furtherance of the prior round obligation, are the subject of a contractual agreement with a developer, or for which the developer has filed a complete application seeking subdivision or site plan approval prior to the date by which the housing element and fair share plan are required to be submitted, and shall demonstrate how any sites that were not built in the prior rounds continue to present a realistic opportunity, which may include proposing changes to the zoning on the site to make its development more likely, and which may also include the dedication of municipal affordable housing trust fund dollars or other monetary or in-kind resources.  The municipality shall only plan to replace any sites planned for development as provided by a prior court approval, settlement agreement, or approval by the council, with alternative development plans, if it is determined that the previously planned sites no longer present a realistic opportunity, and the sites in the alternative development plan provide at least an equivalent number of affordable units and are otherwise in compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine.  If a municipality proposes to replace a site for which a complete application seeking subdivision or site plan approval has not been filed prior to date by which the housing element and fair share plan is required to be submitted, there shall be a rebuttable presumption in any challenge filed to the municipality's plan that any site for which a zoning designation was adopted creating a realistic opportunity for the development of a site prior to July 1, 2020, or July 1 of every 10th year thereafter, as applicable, may be replaced with one or more alternative sites that provide a realistic opportunity for at least the same number of affordable units and is otherwise in compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine.  To the extent a municipality has credits, including bonus credits, from units created during a prior round that are otherwise permitted to be allocated toward the municipalitys unfulfilled prior round obligation or present or prospective need obligation in an upcoming round, the municipality shall be entitled to rely on the rules, including rules for bonus credits, applicable for the round during which those credits were accumulated.  If a municipality has credits in excess of its prior round obligations, and such excess credits represent housing that will continue to be deed-restricted and affordable through the current round, the municipality may include such housing, and applicable bonus credits, towards addressing the municipalitys new calculation of prospective need.  Consistent with subsection k. of section 11 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-311), the total number of bonus credits shall in no circumstance exceed 25 percent of the municipalitys prospective obligation in any round. The municipality may in its plan lower its prospective need obligation to the extent necessary to prevent establishing a prospective need obligation that requires the municipality to provide a realistic opportunity for more than 1,000 housing units, after the application of any excess credits, or to prevent a prospective need obligation that exceeds 20 percent of the total number of households in a municipality according to the most recent federal decennial census, not including any prior round obligation.  If a municipality is subject to both a 1,000 unit cap or 20 percent cap it may apply whichever cap results in a lower prospective need obligation.  For the fifth round, and for each subsequent new round of housing obligations, the deadlines in this paragraph shall be June 30 for the adoption of the housing element and fair share plan, and the proposal of drafts of the appropriate zoning and other ordinances and resolutions to implement its present and prospective obligation, of the year of the start of the new round. (b) Following the filing, in an action, of an adopted housing element and fair share plan pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, an interested party may file a response on or before August 31, 2025 alleging that the municipalitys fair share plan and housing element are not in compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) or the Mount Laurel doctrine.  Such allegation shall not include a claim that a site on real property proposed by the interested party is a better site than a site in the plan, but rather shall be based on whether the housing element and fair share plan as proposed is compliant with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) or the Mount Laurel doctrine.  To resolve a challenge, the program shall apply an objective assessment standard to determine whether or not the municipalitys housing element and fair share plan is compliant with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine.  Any interested party that files a challenge shall specify with particularity which sites or elements of the municipal fair share plan do not comply with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) or the Mount Laurel doctrine, and the basis for alleging such non-compliance.  The program shall establish procedures to summarily dismiss any objection or challenge that does not meet these minimum standards.  For the purpose of efficiency, the program shall, in its own discretion, permit multiple challenges to the same municipal housing element and fair share plan to be consolidated.  If a municipalitys fair share plan and housing element is not challenged on or before August 31, 2025, then the program shall 1apply an objective standard to conduct a limited1 review 1of1 the fair share plan and housing element for consistency and to determine whether it 1enables the municipality to satisfy the fair share obligation, applies compliant mechanisms, meets the threshold requirements for rental and family units, does not exceed limits on other unit or category types, and1 is compliant with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine 1[, and] .  The program shall1 issue a compliance certification unless these objective standards are not met.  The program shall facilitate communication between the municipality and any interested parties for a challenge, and provide the municipality until December 31, 2025 to commit to revising its fair share plan and housing element in compliance with the changes requested in the challenge, or provide an explanation as to why it will not make all of the requested changes, or both.  Upon resolution of a challenge, the program shall issue compliance certification, conditioned on the municipalitys commitment, as necessary, to revise its fair share plan and housing element in accordance with the resolution of the challenge.  The program may also terminate immunity if it finds that the municipality is not determined to come into constitutional compliance at any point in the process.  If by December 31, 2025, the municipality and any interested party that filed a response have resolved the issues raised in the response through agreement or withdrawal of the filing, then the program shall review the fair share plan and housing element for consistency and to determine whether it is compliant with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine, and issue a compliance certification unless these objective standards are not met.  For the fifth round, and each subsequent new round of housing obligations, the deadline established in this subparagraph for an interested party to file a challenge shall be August 31, and for the municipality to revise its housing element and fair share plan in response, shall be December 31, of the year of the beginning of the new round. (c) For the fourth round of affordable housing obligations, the implementing ordinances and resolutions, proposed pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, and incorporating any changes from the program, shall be adopted on or before March 15, 2026.  For the fifth round, and each subsequent new round of housing obligations, the deadline established in this subparagraph for the implementing ordinances and resolutions shall be on March 15 of the year following the beginning of the new round.  After adoption of the implementing ordinances and resolutions by the municipality, the municipality shall immediately file the ordinances and resolutions with the program through the programs Internet website.  Failure to meet the March 15 deadline shall result in the municipality losing immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation. (d) The program may permit a municipality that still has a remaining dispute by interested parties to retain immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation into the year following the year in which a new round begins if the program, or county level housing judge, determines that the municipality has been unable to resolve the issues disputed despite being determined to come into constitutional compliance.  The Administrative Director of the Courts shall develop procedures to enable a county level housing judge to resolve this dispute over the issuance of compliance certification through a summary proceeding in Superior Court following the year in which the new round begins.  A judge shall be permitted to serve as a county level housing judge for more than one county in the same vicinage.  The pendency of such a dispute shall not stay the deadline for adoption of implementing ordinances and resolutions pursuant to this paragraph.  1The implementing ordinances and resolutions adopted prior to the resolution of the dispute may be subject to changes to reflect the results of the dispute.  As an alternative to adopting the implementing ordinances and resolutions by the March 15 deadline, a municipality involved in a continuing dispute over the issuance of compliance certification may adopt a binding resolution by this date to commit to adopting the implementing ordinances and resolutions following resolution of the dispute, with necessary adjustments to reflect the resolution of the dispute.1 (e) Once a municipality has received a compliance certification or otherwise has had its fair share obligation and housing element and fair share plan finally determined via judgment of repose or other judgment, the municipality shall make the municipalitys fair share plan and housing element, as well as any subsequently adopted implementing ordinances and resolutions, or amendments thereto, available to the department and the program for publication on the departments and programs respective Internet websites. (3) (a)  If a municipality fails to 1materially1 adhere to any of the deadlines established in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection due to circumstances beyond the control of the municipality, including but not limited to an inability to meet a deadline due to an extreme weather event, then the program, or the county level housing judge, in accordance with court rules, may permit a municipality to have a grace period to come into compliance with the timeline, the length of which, and effect of which on later deadlines, shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. (b) A municipality that has not adopted and published a binding resolution pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or that has not adopted and filed a housing element and fair share plan pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection may seek compliance certification by filing an action pursuant to section 13 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-313), provided that any 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation filed by a plaintiff against such a municipality prior to such time may proceed notwithstanding such filing.  In a municipality that has adopted and published a binding resolution pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and has adopted and filed a housing element and fair share plan pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a court shall not 1[grant a builders remedy to a plaintiff in] consider1 exclusionary zoning litigation during the timeframe after the timely submission of a binding resolution or fair share plan and housing element of a municipality, or both, and before a challenge is submitted, or during the timeframe of a challenge that is pending resolution with the program pursuant to this subsection.  A court may 1[grant a builders remedy to a plaintiff in] consider1 exclusionary zoning litigation after such timeframe upon a finding that the municipality: (i) is determined to be constitutionally noncompliant with its responsibilities pursuant to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) or is participating in the program in bad faith; (ii) has failed to meet the deadlines established pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); or (iii) has, after receiving compliance certification, failed to comply with the terms of that certification by not actually allowing for the development of the affordable housing as provided for in its fair share plan and housing element through actions, omissions, or both, of a municipality or its subordinate boards. (c) All parties shall bear their own fees and costs in proceedings before the program. (d) A determination by the program as to the present and prospective need obligation or as to issuance of compliance certification pursuant to this section shall be considered a final decision, subject to appellate review pursuant to the procedures set forth in subparagraph (c) of paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section. (e) A municipality shall not be deemed out of compliance with the deadlines of P.L. , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or lose immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation, due to a failure by the program to promptly maintain and update its Internet website, or other operational failure of the program. 1g.  The program shall be made a party to, and shall be responsible for defending its issuance of compliance certification in, any litigation alleging that, despite the issuance of compliance certification, a municipalitys fair share obligation, fair share plan, housing element, or ordinances implementing the fair share plan or housing element are not in compliance with the Mount Laurel doctrine.1 4. Section 13 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-313) is amended to read as follows: 13. a.  [A] If a municipality [which] has [filed a housing element may, at any time during a two-year period following the filing of the housing element, petition the council for a substantive certification of its element and ordinances or] adopted a housing element and fair share plan pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), but has failed to satisfy the June 30 deadline established pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection f. of section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), for any round of affordable housing obligations, the municipality may request and be provided with a grace period pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection f. of section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), if authorized by the program or county level housing judge, as determined by the rules of court.  If a municipality that has not satisfied this June 30 deadline is not provided with a grace period, the municipality may institute an action for declaratory judgment granting it repose in the Superior Court [, but in no event shall a grant of substantive certification extend beyond a 10-year period starting on the date the municipality files its housing element with the council] for the 10-year period constituting the current round of fair share obligations.  The municipality shall publish notice of its [petition] filing of a declaratory judgment action in a newspaper of general circulation within the municipality and county and shall make available to the public information on the element and ordinances by submitting such information to the program to be published on the Internet website of the program in accordance with [such procedures as the council shall establish.  The council shall also establish a procedure for providing public notice of each petition which it receives] section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b. [Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, a municipality which filed a housing element prior to the effective date of P.L.1990, c.121, shall be permitted to petition for substantive certification at any time within two years following that filing, or within one year following the effective date of P.L.1990, c.121, whichever shall result in permitting the municipality the longer period of time within which to petition.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill) [The Council shall establish procedures for] c.  (1)  A municipality or other interested party may file an action through the program seeking a realistic opportunity review [at the midpoint of the certification period and shall provide for notice to the public] at the midpoint of the certification period and shall provide for notice to the public, including a realistic opportunity review of any inclusionary development site in the housing element and fair share plan that has not received preliminary site plan approval prior to the midpoint of the 10-year round.  If such an action is initiated by a municipality, the municipality 1[shall] may1 propose one or more alternative sites with an accompanying development plan or plans that provide a realistic opportunity for the same number of affordable units and is otherwise in compliance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the Mount Laurel doctrine, provided that if the facts demonstrate that the municipality or its subordinate boards have prevented the site from receiving site plan approval, then the program shall reject the municipalitys challenge. (2) Any party may file a request for information from the program regarding the progress of development at any inclusionary development site in the housing element and fair share plan of a municipality, or at any alternative site proposed by the municipality.  The program may respond to a request independently or in coordination with the department. (cf: P.L.2001, c.435, s.5) 5. (New section)  a.  There is established an Affordable Housing Dispute Resolution Program that shall have the purpose of efficiently resolving disputes involving the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), to consist of an odd number of members, of at least three and no more than seven members who shall lead the administration of the program.  The 1[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court] Administrative Director of the Courts1 shall update the assignment of designated Mount Laurel judges to indicate which current or retired and on recall judges of the Superior Court shall serve as members, within 1[40] 601 days following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The 1[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court] Administrative Director of the Courts1 may appoint other qualified experts as members if sufficient current and retired judges are unavailable.  The 1[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court] Administrative Director of the Courts1 shall take into consideration in making such appointments experience in the employment of alternative dispute resolution methods and in relevant subject matter. b. The 1[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court] Administrative Director of the Courts1 shall designate a member to serve as chair.  The 1[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court] Administrative Director of the Courts1 shall make new appointments as needs arise for new appointments. c. The program, in its discretion and in accordance with Rules of Court, may consult or employ the services of one or more special masters or staff to assist it in rendering determinations, resolving disputes, and facilitating communication as required by subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of subsection f. of section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  In addition, the program may incorporate any existing or newly established court mediation or alternative dispute resolution process to assist the program in resolving disputes and facilitating communication among municipalities and interested parties. d. The Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish a filing system via an Internet website in which the public is able to access, without cost, filings made pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and such other related filings as the Administrative Director of the Courts may include on the filing system. e. The Administrative Director of the Courts may assign additional responsibilities to the program for resolving disputes arising out of or related to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). f. The Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish procedures for the purpose of efficiently resolving disputes involving the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), for circumstances in which the program is unable to address the dispute within the time limitations established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  As a part of the procedures established pursuant to this section, in order to facilitate an appropriate level of localized control of affordable housing decisions, for each vicinage, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall designate a Superior Court judge who sits within the vicinage, or a retired judge who, during the judges tenure as a judge, served within the vicinage, to serve as county level housing judge to resolve disputes over the compliance, of fair share plans and housing elements of municipalities within their designated county or counties, with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), as well as disputes that arise with respect to ongoing compliance or noncompliance with obligations created by fair share plans, housing elements, and the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.).  A judge shall be permitted to serve as a county level housing judge for more than one county in the same vicinage. g. The Administrative Director of the Courts shall promulgate, maintain, and apply a Code of Ethics that is modeled upon the Code of Judicial Conduct of the American Bar Association, as amended and adopted by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, and may establish additional, more restrictive ethical standards in order to meet the specific needs of the program, and of county level housing judges. 6.  (New section)  a. Municipal present need for each 10-year round of affordable housing obligations shall be determined by estimating the deficient housing units occupied by low- and moderate-income households in the region, following a methodology similar to the methodology used to determine third round municipal present need, through the use of most recent datasets made available through the federal decennial census and the American Community Survey. b.  For the purpose of determining regional need for the 10-year round of low- and moderate-income housing obligations, running from July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2035, and each 10-year round thereafter: (1)  The regions of the State shall be comprised as follows: (a)  Region 1 shall consist of the counties of Bergen, Hudson, Passaic, and Sussex; (b)  Region 2 shall consist of the counties of Essex, Morris, Union, and Warren; (c)  Region 3 shall consist of the counties of Hunterdon, Middlesex, and Somerset; (d)  Region 4 shall consist of the counties of Mercer, Monmouth, and Ocean; (e)  Region 5 shall consist of the counties of Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester; and (f)  Region 6 shall consist of the counties of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, and Salem. (2)  Regional prospective need for a 10-year round of low- and moderate-income housing obligations shall be determined through the calculation provided in this subsection.  Projected household change for a 10-year round in a region shall be estimated by establishing the household change experienced in the region between the most recent federal decennial census, and the second-most recent federal decennial census.  This household change, if positive, shall be divided by 2.5 to estimate the number of low- and moderate-income homes needed to address low- and moderate-income household change in the region, and to determine the regional prospective need for a 10-year round of low- and moderate-income housing obligations.  If household change is zero or negative, the number of low- and moderate-income homes needed to address low- and moderate-income household change in the region and the regional prospective need shall be zero. 7. (New section)  a.  The present and prospective fair share obligation for low- and moderate-income housing for each municipality in the State shall be determined as described in this section.  In addition, the March 8, 2018 unpublished decision of the Superior Court, Law Division, Mercer County, In re Application of Municipality of Princeton shall be referenced as to datasets and methodologies that are not explicitly addressed by this section. These determinations of municipal present and prospective need shall be based on a determination of the present and prospective regional need for low- and moderate-income housing, established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  These calculations of municipal present and prospective need shall use necessary datasets that are updated to the greatest extent practicable. b. A municipalitys present need obligation shall be determined by estimating the existing deficient housing units currently occupied by low- and moderate-income households within the municipality, following a methodology comparable to the methodology used to determine third round present need, through the use of datasets made available through the federal decennial census and the American Community Survey. c. A municipalitys prospective fair share obligation of the regional prospective need for the upcoming 10-year round shall be determined in accordance with this subsection: (1) If a municipality is a qualified urban aid municipality, the municipality shall be exempt from responsibility for any fair share prospective need obligation for the upcoming 10-year round.  For the purposes of this section, a municipality is a qualified urban aid municipality if the municipality, as of July 1 of the year prior to the beginning of a new round, is designated by the department, pursuant to P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178 et seq.), to receive State aid, and the municipality meets at least one of the following criteria: (a) The ratio of substandard existing deficient housing units currently occupied by low- and moderate-income households within the municipality, compared to all existing housing in the municipality, is greater than the equivalent ratio in the region; (b) The municipality has a population density greater than 10,000 persons per square mile of land area; or (c) The municipality has a population density of more than 6,000, but less than 10,000 persons per square mile of land area, and less than five percent vacant parcels not used as farmland, as measured by the average of: (i) The number of vacant land parcels in the municipality as a percentage of the total number of parcels in the municipality; and (ii) The valuation of vacant land in the municipality as a percentage of total valuations in the municipality. (2) A municipalitys equalized nonresidential valuation factor shall be determined.  To determine this factor, the changes in nonresidential property valuations in the municipality, since the beginning of the round preceding the round being calculated, shall be calculated using data published by the Division of Local Government Services in the department.  The change in the municipalitys nonresidential valuations shall be divided by the regional total change in nonresidential valuations to determine the municipalitys share of the regional change as the equalized nonresidential valuation factor. (3) A municipalitys income capacity factor shall be determined.  This factor shall be determined by calculating the average of the following measures: (a) The municipal share of the regional sum of the differences between the median municipal household income, according to the most recent American Community Survey Five-Year Estimates, and an income floor of $100 below the lowest median household income in the region; and (b) The municipal share of the regional sum of the differences between the median municipal household incomes and an income floor of $100 below the lowest median household income in the region, weighted by the number of the households in the municipality. (4) A municipalitys land capacity factor shall be determined.  This factor shall be determined by estimating the area of developable 1[and redevelopable]1 land in the municipalitys boundaries, and regional boundaries, that may accommodate development through the use of the "land use / land cover data" most recently published by the Department of Environmental Protection, and weighing such land based on the planning area type in which such land is located.  After the weighing factors are applied, the sum of the total developable 1[and redevelopable]1 land area that may accommodate development in the municipality, and in the region shall be determined.  The municipalitys share of its regions developable 1[and redevelopable]1 land shall be its land capacity factor. Developable 1[and redevelopable]1 land that may accommodate development shall be weighted based on the planning area type in which such land is located, as designated pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.), P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.), or P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et seq.), as follows: (a) Planning Area 1 (Metropolitan) shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (b) Planning Area 2 (Suburban) shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (c) Planning Area 3 (Fringe) shall have a weighting factor of 0.5; (d) Planning Area 4 (Rural) shall have a weighting factor of 0.0; (e) Planning Area 5 (Environmentally Sensitive) shall have a weighting factor of 0.0; (f) Centers in Planning Areas 1 and 2 shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (g) Centers in Planning Areas 3, 4, and 5 shall have a weighting factor of 0.5; (h) Pinelands Regional Growth Area shall have a weighting factor of 0.5; (i) Pinelands Town shall have a weighting factor of 0.5; (j) All other Pinelands shall have a weighting factor of 0.0; (k) Meadowlands shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (l) Meadowlands Center shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (m) Highlands Preservation Area shall have a weighting factor of 0.0; (n) Highlands Planning Area Existing Community Zone, opted in municipality by May 1, 2022 shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; (o) Highlands Planning Area, State-designated sewer service area, municipality not opted in by May 1, 2022, shall have a weighting factor of 1.0; and (p) All other Highlands Planning Areas shall have a weighting factor of 0.0. (5) The equalized nonresidential valuation factor, income capacity factor, and land capacity factor, determined in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection, shall be averaged to yield the municipalitys average allocation factor for distributing gross regional prospective need to the municipality.  The regional prospective need shall then be multiplied by the municipalitys average allocation factor to determine the municipalitys gross prospective need for the 10-year round. (6) Secondary sources of supply and demand shall be adjusted for by first calculating demolitions of low- and moderate-income housing, and housing creation through low- and moderate-income residential conversions.  A municipalitys share of low- and moderate-income conversions shall then be subtracted from the sum of each municipalitys allocated share of gross prospective need and demolitions of low- and moderate-income housing. 8.  Section 4 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-56) is amended to read as follows: 4.  a.  Upon failure to perform any obligation of a residential mortgage by the residential mortgage debtor and before any residential mortgage lender may accelerate the maturity of any residential mortgage obligation and commence any foreclosure or other legal action to take possession of the residential property which is the subject of the mortgage, the residential mortgage lender shall give a notice of intention, which shall include a notice of the right to cure the default as provided in section 5 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-57), at least 30 days, but not more than 180 days, in advance of such action as provided in this section, to the residential mortgage debtor, and, if the mortgage is secured by a residence for which a restriction on affordability was recorded in the county in which the property is located, the clerk of the municipality in which the subject property is located, the municipal housing liaison, if one has been appointed by the municipality [pursuant to the regulations of the Council on Affordable Housing, and the Commissioner of Community Affairs]. For the purposes of this section, "restriction on affordability" means any conditions recorded with a mortgage or a deed which would limit the sale of such property to income qualified households pursuant to the rules adopted to effectuate the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). b.    Notice of intention to take action as specified in subsection a. of this section shall be in writing, provided to the Department of Community Affairs in accordance with subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2019, c.134 (C.46:10B-49.2), sent to the debtor by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at the debtor's last known address, and, if different, to the address of the property which is the subject of the residential mortgage.  The notice is deemed to have been effectuated on the date the notice is delivered in person or mailed to the party. c.    The written notice shall clearly and conspicuously state in a manner calculated to make the debtor aware of the situation: (1)   the particular obligation or real estate security interest; (2)   the nature of the default claimed; (3)   the right of the debtor to cure the default as provided in section 5 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-57); (4)   what performance, including what sum of money, if any, and interest, shall be tendered to cure the default as of the date specified under paragraph (5) of this subsection c.; (5)   the date by which the debtor shall cure the default to avoid initiation of foreclosure proceedings, which date shall not be less than 30 days after the date the notice is effective, and the name and address and phone number of a person to whom the payment or tender shall be made; (6)   that if the debtor does not cure the default by the date specified under paragraph (5) of this subsection c., the lender may take steps to terminate the debtor's ownership in the property by commencing a foreclosure suit in a court of competent jurisdiction; (7)   that if the lender takes the steps indicated pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection c., a debtor shall still have the right to cure the default pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-57), but that the debtor shall be responsible for the lender's court costs and attorneys' fees in an amount not to exceed that amount permitted pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey; (8)   the right, if any, of the debtor to transfer the real estate to another person subject to the security interest and that the transferee may have the right to cure the default as provided in P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-53 et seq.), subject to the mortgage documents; (9)   that the debtor is advised to seek counsel from an attorney of the debtor's own choosing concerning the debtor's residential mortgage default situation, and that, if the debtor is unable to obtain an attorney, the debtor may communicate with the New Jersey Bar Association or Lawyer Referral Service in the county in which the residential property securing the mortgage loan is located; and that, if the debtor is unable to afford an attorney, the debtor may communicate with the Legal Services Office in the county in which the property is located; (10)  the possible availability of financial assistance for curing a default from programs operated by the State or federal government or nonprofit organizations, if any, as identified by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance and, if the property is subject to restrictions on affordability, the address and phone number of the municipal affordable housing liaison and of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.  This requirement shall be satisfied by attaching a list of such programs promulgated by the commissioner; (11)  the name and address of the lender and the telephone number of a representative of the lender whom the debtor may contact if the debtor disagrees with the lender's assertion that a default has occurred or the correctness of the mortgage lender's calculation of the amount required to cure the default; (12)  that if the lender takes the steps indicated pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection, the debtor has the option to participate in the Foreclosure Mediation Program following the filing of a mortgage foreclosure complaint by initiating mediation pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 4 of P.L.2019, c.64 (C.2A:50-77). Notice of the option to participate in the Foreclosure Mediation Program shall adhere to the requirements of section 3 of P.L.2019, c.64 (C.2A:50-76) and any court rules, procedures, or guidelines adopted by the Supreme Court; (13)  that the debtor is entitled to housing counseling, at no cost to the debtor, through the Foreclosure Mediation Program established by the New Jersey Judiciary, including information on how to contact the program; (14)  that if the property which is the subject of the mortgage has more than one dwelling unit but less than five, one of which is occupied by the debtor or a member of the debtor's immediate family as the debtor's or member's residence at the time the loan is originated, and is not properly maintained and meets the necessary conditions for receivership eligibility, established pursuant to section 4 of the "Multifamily Housing Preservation and Receivership Act," P.L.2003, c.295 (C.2A:42-117), the residential mortgage lender shall file an order to show cause to appoint a receiver; and (15)  that the lender is either licensed in accordance with the "New Jersey Residential Mortgage Lending Act," sections 1 through 39 of P.L.2009, c.53 (C.17:11C-51 through C.17:11C-89) or exempt from licensure under the act in accordance with applicable law. d.    The notice of intention to foreclose required to be provided pursuant to this section shall not be required if the debtor has voluntarily surrendered the property which is the subject of the residential mortgage. e.     The duty of the lender under this section to serve notice of intention to foreclose is independent of any other duty to give notice under the common law, principles of equity, State or federal statute, or rule of court and of any other right or remedy the debtor may have as a result of the failure to give such notice. f.     Compliance with this section and subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2019, c.134 (C.46:10B-49.2) shall be set forth in the pleadings of any legal action referred to in this section. If the plaintiff in any complaint seeking foreclosure of a residential mortgage alleges that the property subject to the residential mortgage has been abandoned or voluntarily surrendered, the plaintiff shall plead the specific facts upon which this allegation is based. g.    If more than 180 days have elapsed since the date the notice required pursuant to this section is sent, and any foreclosure or other legal action to take possession of the residential property which is the subject of the mortgage has not yet been commenced, the lender shall send a new written notice at least 30 days, but not more than 180 days, in advance of that action. h.    If the property which is the subject of the notice of intention to foreclose has more than one dwelling unit but less than five, one of which is occupied by the debtor or a member of the debtor's immediate family as the debtor's or member's residence at the time the loan is originated, and is not properly maintained and meets the necessary conditions for receivership eligibility, established pursuant to section 4 of the "Multifamily Housing Preservation and Receivership Act," P.L.2003, c.295 (C.2A:42-117), the residential mortgage lender shall file an order to show cause to appoint a receiver. (cf: P.L.2019, c.134, s.4) 9.  Section 2 of P.L.2005, c.306 (C.5:18-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.  The New Jersey Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, established under P.L.1999, c.265 (C.26:1A-37.5 et seq.) is authorized to provide grants to assist low-income families in purchasing the protective eyewear.  As used in this section, a "low-income family" means a family which qualifies for low-income housing under the standards promulgated by the [Council on Affordable Housing] New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency pursuant to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). (cf: P.L.2005, c.306, s.2) 10.  Section 25 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-23) is amended to read as follows: 25.  a.  The [Council on Affordable Housing shall take into consideration the] regional master plan [prior to making any] shall be taken into account as part of the determination of obligations pursuant to the method in section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) regarding the allocation of the prospective fair share of the housing need [in any municipality in the Highlands Region] under the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) for [the] any fair share period subsequent to [1999] the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) if a municipality is in the Highlands Region. b.    Nothing in [this act] P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.) shall affect protections provided through a grant of substantive certification or a judgment of repose granted prior to [the date of enactment of this act] August 10, 2004.

(cf: P.L.1997, c.411, s.11) 13.  Section 33 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.2) is amended to read as follows: 33.  The Legislature finds and declares: a.  The collection of development fees from builders of residential and non-residential properties has been authorized by the court through the powers [delegated to the Council on Affordable Housing] established pursuant to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.).  Due to the Legislatures determination that the role of the Council on Affordable Housing has not developed in practice as intended, the Legislature further determines that authority relating to rulemaking on the collection of residential and non-residential development fees is appropriately delegated to the Department of Community Affairs, given the departments existing roles related to local government finance and the funding and financing of affordable housing throughout the State. b.  New Jersey's land resources are becoming more scarce, while its redevelopment needs are increasing.  In order to balance the needs of developing and redeveloping communities, a reasonable method of providing for the housing needs of [low and moderate income] low-, moderate-, and [middle income] middle-income households, without mandating the inclusion of housing in every non-residential project, must be established. c.  A Statewide non-residential development fee program, which permits municipalities [under the council's jurisdiction] that have obtained or are in the process of seeking compliance certification to retain these fees for use in the municipality will provide a fair and balanced funding method to address the State's affordable housing needs, while providing an incentive to all municipalities to [seek substantive] obtain compliance certification [from the council]. d.  Whereas, pursuant to P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-1 et seq.), organizations are directed to invest in the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority to ensure that the development of housing for families of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income shall be provided.  The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority [, in consultation with the council,] shall work to effectuate the purpose and intent of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). e.  [The "Statewide Non-Residential Development Fee Act," sections 32 through 38 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.1 through C.40:55D-8.7), prohibits municipalities from imposing their own fees to fund affordable housing on non-residential development, and P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-489a et al.) is not intended to alter this underlying policy.] Deleted by amendment P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill) f.  The negative impact of a State policy that over-relies on a municipal fee structure and of State programs that require a municipality to impose fees and charges on developers must be balanced against any public good expected from such regulation.  It is undisputable that the charging of fees at high levels dissuades commerce from locating within a State or municipality or locality and halts non-residential and residential development, and these ill effects directly increase the overall costs of housing, and could impede the constitutional obligation to provide for a realistic opportunity for housing for families at all income levels. (cf: P.L.2009, c.90, s.36) 14.  Section 34 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.3) is amended to read as follows: 34.  As used in sections 32 through 38 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.1 through C.40:55D-8.7): "Construction" means new construction and additions, but does not include alterations, reconstruction, renovations, and repairs as those terms are defined under the State Uniform Construction Code promulgated pursuant to the "State Uniform Construction Code Act," P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.).

"Spending plan" means a method of allocating funds collected and to be collected pursuant to an approved municipal development fee ordinance, or pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1 et al.) for the purpose of meeting the housing needs of low and moderate income individuals. "Treasurer" means the Treasurer of the State of New Jersey.

Section 11 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-311) is amended to read as follows: 11. a.  In adopting its housing element, the municipality may provide for its fair share of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing by means of any technique or combination of techniques which provide a realistic opportunity for the provision of the fair share.  The housing element shall contain an analysis demonstrating that it will provide such a realistic opportunity, and the municipality shall establish that its land use and other relevant ordinances have been revised to incorporate the provisions for [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing.  In preparing the housing element, the municipality shall consider the following techniques for providing [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing within the municipality, as well as such other appropriate techniques as have been established through applicable precedent and may be [published by the council or proposed] employed by the municipality: (1)  Rezoning for densities necessary to assure the economic viability of any inclusionary developments, either through mandatory set-asides or density bonuses, as may be necessary to meet all or part of the municipality's fair share in accordance with [the regulations of the council and] the provisions of subsection h. of this section; (2)  Determination of the total residential zoning necessary to assure that the municipality's fair share is achieved; (3)  Determination of measures that the municipality will take to assure that [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income units remain affordable to [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income households for an appropriate period of not less than [six years] the period required by the regulations adopted by the Department of Community Affairs pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321); (4)  A plan for infrastructure expansion and rehabilitation and conversion or redevelopment of unused or underutilized real property, including existing structures, if necessary to assure the achievement of the municipality's fair share of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing; (5)  Donation or use of municipally owned land or land condemned by the municipality for purposes of providing [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing; (6)  Tax abatements for purposes of providing [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing; (7)  Utilization of funds obtained from any State or federal subsidy toward the construction of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing; (8)  Utilization of municipally generated funds toward the construction of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing; and (9)  The purchase of privately owned real property used for residential purposes at the value of all liens secured by the property, excluding any tax liens, notwithstanding that the total amount of debt secured by liens exceeds the appraised value of the property, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Community Affairs pursuant to subsection b. of section 41 of P.L.2000, c.126 (C.52:27D-311.2). b.   The municipality may provide for a phasing schedule for the achievement of its fair share of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing. c.   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2008, c.46) d.   Nothing in P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) shall require a municipality to raise or expend municipal revenues in order to provide [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing. e.   When a municipality's housing element includes the provision of rental housing units in a community residence for the developmentally disabled , for the mentally ill, or for persons with head injuries, as those terms are defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, c.448 (C.30:11B-2), or in transitional housing, which will be affordable to persons of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income, and for which adequate measures to retain such affordability pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of this section are included in the housing element, those housing units shall be fully credited [as permitted under the rules of the council] towards the fulfillment of the municipality's fair share of [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income housing.  A municipality shall not credit transitional housing units towards more than 10 percent of the municipalitys fair share obligation. f.    It having been determined by the Legislature that the provision of housing under P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) is a public purpose, a municipality or municipalities may utilize public monies to make donations, grants or loans of public funds for the rehabilitation of deficient housing units and the provision of new or substantially rehabilitated housing for [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income persons, providing that any private advantage is incidental. g. A municipality [which] that has received [substantive certification from the council] approval of its housing element and fair share plan for the current round, and [which] that has actually effected the construction of the affordable housing units it is obligated to provide, may amend its affordable housing element or zoning ordinances without [the approval of the council] losing immunity from 1[builders remedy] exclusionary zoning1 litigation. h.   Whenever affordable housing units are proposed to be provided through an inclusionary development, a municipality shall provide, through its zoning powers, incentives to the developer, which shall include increased densities and reduced costs [, in accordance with the regulations of the council and this subsection]. i.    [The council, upon the application of a] A municipality and a developer [,] may [approve] request a modification of a compliance certification involving reduced affordable housing set-asides or increased densities to ensure the economic feasibility of an inclusionary development , if any such application demonstrates how any shortfall in meeting the municipal fair share obligation will then be addressed.  Such a request may be granted only if the municipality and developer have demonstrated that the project has been impacted by market conditions beyond their reasonable control. j.    A municipality may enter into an agreement with a developer or residential development owner to provide a preference for affordable housing to [low and moderate income] low- and moderate-income veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as defined in section 1 of P.L.1963, c.171 (C.54:4-8.10), of up to 50 percent of the affordable units in that particular project.  This preference shall be established in the applicant selection process for available affordable units so that applicants who are veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as referenced in this subsection, and who apply within 90 days of the initial marketing period shall receive preference for the rental of the agreed-upon percentage of affordable units. After the first 90 days of the initial 120-day marketing period, if any of those units subject to the preference remain available, then applicants from the general public shall be considered for occupancy.  Following the initial 120-day marketing period, previously qualified applicants and future qualified applicants who are veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as referenced in this subsection, shall be placed on a special waiting list as well as the general waiting list.  The veterans on the special waiting list shall be given preference for affordable units, as the units become available, whenever the percentage of preference-occupied units falls below the agreed upon percentage.  Any agreement to provide affordable housing preferences for veterans pursuant to this subsection shall not affect a municipality's ability to receive credit for the unit [from the council, or its successor]. k. In the fourth round, and in subsequent rounds of affordable housing obligations, a municipality shall be able to receive one credit against its affordable housing obligation for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing, and shall not receive bonus credit for any particular type of low- or moderate-income housing, unless authority to obtain bonus credit is expressly provided pursuant to this section, or other sections of the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.).  A municipality shall not receive more than one type of bonus credit for any unit, and a municipality shall not be permitted to satisfy more than 25 percent of its prospective need obligation in the fourth round or any subsequent round through the use of bonus credits.  This subsection shall not be construed to limit the ability of a municipality to receive a unit of credit for a low- or moderate-income housing unit that is subject to affordability controls that are scheduled to expire, but are extended 1[in accordance with the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency] pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321)1, to the extent that this affordability control extension would otherwise generate this credit.  As a part of a fair share plan and housing element adopted pursuant to subsection f. of section 3 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), a municipality shall: (1) receive one unit of credit and one bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing for individuals with special needs or permanent supportive housing, as those terms are defined in section 2 of P.L. 2004, c.70 (C.34:1B-21.24); (2) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for each low- or moderate-income ownership unit created in partnership sponsorship with a non-profit housing developer; (3) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing located within a one-half mile radius, or one-mile radius for projects located in a Garden State Growth Zone, as defined in section 2 of P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-243), surrounding a New Jersey Transit Corporation, Port Authority Transit Corporation, or Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation rail, bus, or ferry station, including all light rail stations.  For the purpose of this subparagraph, the distance from the bus, rail, or ferry station to a housing unit shall be measured from the closest point on the outer perimeter of the station, including any associated park-and-ride lot, to the closest point of the housing project property; (4) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for a unit of age-restricted housing, provided that a bonus credit for age-restricted housing shall not be applied to more than 1[15] 101 percent of the units of age-restricted housing constructed in compliance with the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency in a municipality that count towards the municipalitys affordable housing obligation for any single 10-year round of affordable housing obligations; (5) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income family housing with at least three bedrooms above the minimum number required by the bedroom distribution 1[in a given development] .  This bonus credit shall be calculated by taking into account the full municipal fair share plan and housing element, and the number of units with at least three bedrooms required for projects satisfying the minimum 50 percent family housing requirements.  A municipality shall receive the bonus credit pursuant to this paragraph for each unit with at least three bedrooms that are above the minimum number required for the bedroom distribution determined pursuant to the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency1; (6) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for a unit of low- or moderate-income housing constructed on land that is or was previously developed and utilized for retail, office, or commercial space; (7) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for each existing low- or moderate-income rental housing unit for which affordability controls are extended for a new term of affordability, in compliance with the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, and the municipality contributes funding towards the costs necessary for this preservation; (8) receive one unit of credit and 1[one-half] one1 bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing in a 100 percent affordable housing project 1[toward] for1 which the municipality 1[either contributes property without which the project would not be feasible, or makes contributions from the municipal affordable housing trust fund that cover no less than 10 percent of the project cost] contributes toward the costs of the project. This contribution may consist of: (a) real property donations that enable siting and construction of the project; or (b) contributions from the municipal affordable housing trust fund in support of the project, if the contribution consists of no less than three percent of the project cost1; 1[and]1 (9) receive one unit of credit and one-half bonus credit for each unit of very low-income housing for families above the 13 percent of units required to be reserved for very low-income housing pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1).  1In accordance with section 7 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1), a municipality shall not be required to provide that a specific percentage of the units in any specific project be reserved as very low-income housing in order to obtain this bonus credit, and the 13 percent level, for the purpose of bonus credits, shall be calculated against the full prospective need obligation provided pursuant to the fair share plan; and (10) receive one unit of credit and one bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing created by transforming an existing rental or ownership unit from a market rate unit to an affordable housing unit.  A municipality may only rely on this bonus credit as part of its fair share plan and housing element if the municipality demonstrates that a commitment to follow through with this market to affordable agreement has been made and: (a) this agreement has been signed by the property owner; or (b) the municipality has obtained ownership of the property.1 l. A municipality may not satisfy more than 1[25] 301 percent of the affordable housing units, exclusive of any bonus credits, to address its prospective need affordable housing obligation through the creation of age-restricted housing.  A municipality shall satisfy a minimum of 50 percent of the actual affordable housing units, exclusive of any bonus credits, created to address its prospective need affordable housing obligation through the creation of housing available to families with children and otherwise in compliance with the requirements and controls established pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321).  A municipality shall satisfy a minimum of 25 percent of the actual affordable housing units, exclusive of any bonus credits, to address its prospective need affordable housing obligation, through rental housing, including at least half of that number available to families with children.  All units referred to in this section shall otherwise be in compliance  with the requirements and controls established pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321). m. All parties shall be entitled to rely upon regulations on municipal credits, adjustments, and compliance mechanisms adopted by the Council on Affordable Housing unless those regulations are contradicted by statute, including but not limited to P.L.    c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or binding court decisions. (cf: P.L.2013, c.6, s.1) 25. Section 6 of P.L.2005, c.350 (C.52:27D-311b) is amended to read as follows: 6. [The council] A municipality may take such measures as are necessary to assure compliance with the adaptability requirements imposed pursuant to P.L.2005, c.350 (C.52:27D-311a et al.), including the inspection of those units which are newly constructed and receive housing credit as provided under section 1 of P.L.2005, c.350 (C.52:27D-311a) for adaptability, as part of the monitoring which occurs pursuant to P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.).  No housing unit subject to the provisions of section 5 of P.L.2005, c.350 (C.52:27D-123.15) and to the provisions of the barrier free subcode adopted by the Commissioner of Community Affairs pursuant to the "State Uniform Construction Code Act," P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.) shall be eligible for inclusion in a municipal fair share plan unless the unit complies with the requirements set forth thereunder.  If any units for which credit was granted in accordance with the provisions of P.L.2005, c.350 (C.52:27D-311a et al.) are found not to conform to the requirements of P.L.2005, c.350 (C.52:27D-311a et al.), [the council may] any party representing the interests of households with disabilities may seek a modification to the approval of the municipal fair share plan to require the municipality to amend its fair share plan within 90 days of [receiving notice from the council] such a finding, to address its fair share obligation pursuant to P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.).  In the event that the municipality fails to amend its fair share plan within 90 days of [receiving such notice, the council may revoke substantive certification] such a finding, the municipality shall lose immunity to 1[a builders remedy] exclusionary zoning litigation1 for the portion of its obligation that is found not to conform to the requirements of P.L.2005, c.350 (C.52:27D-311a et al.).
