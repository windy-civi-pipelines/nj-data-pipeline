<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends current law
to authorize certain activities in which a holder of a limited brewery license
is permitted to engage.  Specifically, this bill authorizes the holder of a
limited brewery license to engage in activities which include, but are not
limited to including: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) an unlimited number of
on-premises special events, for which the license holder may sell tickets
without requiring the license holder to obtain a permit or provide electronic
notification to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) up to 18 off-premises
special events per year pursuant to a permit issued by the director of the ABC
for each event.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If an event is to be held on a
publicly-owned or controlled property, the licensee would be required to obtain
consent from the political subdivision that owns or controls the property or
the chief law enforcement officer of the law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction
over the property.  Under the bill, a license holder also is permitted to
deliver its product to a consumers home; sell soda and coffee, whether or not
manufactured by the license holder; coordinate with a food vendor to provide
food on the licensed premises; and provide menus to consumers.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill eliminates
the requirement that the license holder provide a tour to a consumer prior to
serving alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed premises.  The bill
further provides that pourers and servers employed by the licensed brewery are
not required to be certified by an industry-recognized server training
program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines on-premises
special event to mean an event that is open to the public and held on the
licensed premises or the sidewalk, parking lot, or other area owned by the
license holder that is adjacent to or adjoining the licensed premises and
includes, but is not limited to: private parties such as birthdays, weddings,
anniversaries, civic and political functions, professional and trade
association events, class reunion and alumni events; trivia and quiz games;
paint and sip; craftmaking; pop up shops; DJs, live music, and open mic; televised
or streamed sporting events; educational events and seminars; movies and
theatrical events; animal adoption, to the extent permitted by local ordinance;
and yoga and other exercise classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Off-premises special events are
defined as special events that take place at a location other than on the
licensed premises or the sidewalk, parking lot, or other area owned by the
license holder that is adjacent to or adjoining the licensed premises and
include, but are not limited to: beer, music, and arts festivals; civic events;
foot races, mud races, bike races and other athletic events; limited brewery
anniversary celebrations; and holiday celebrations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes a
winery-brewery sublicense that would permit wineries to produce malt alcoholic
beverages for retail sale to consumers for consumption off the licensed
premises and establishes a farm brewery license that would permit the licensee
to produce malt alcoholic beverages for retail sale to consumers for
consumption off the licensed premises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A farm brewery would operate
in much the same manner as a farm winery, using locally grown farm products in
brewing malt beverages which would be sold at the farm.  A licensee would be
required to be actively engaged in farming on or adjacent to the brewery site
and to be actively cultivating hops or other products used in the production of
the malt alcoholic beverages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A farm brewery licensee would
be permitted to brew up to 2,000 barrels of malt alcoholic beverages per year
for retail sale for consumption off the premises and to offer samples.  A
graduated license based on volume would range in cost from $100 to $300
annually.  A single individual or entity would be permitted to hold only one
farm brewery license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The winery-brewery sublicense
established by the bill would be available to plenary and farm winery licensees,
provided they are actively engaged in farming on or adjacent to the winery
premises and are growing and cultivating hops or another product used in the
production of the malt alcoholic beverages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the provisions of the
bill, the holder of a winery-brewery sublicense would be permitted to brew up
to 3,000 barrels of malt beverages per year and to sell this product at retail
for off premises <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>consumption and to offer samples. 
The bill does not authorize a licensee to sell any malt alcoholic beverages to
wholesalers and retailers.  The annual fee for this sublicense would be $750.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A winery-brewery licensee
would be permitted to hold only one sublicense under the bill.</p>
