Under current law, it is a crime to utilize digital instructions to illegally manufacture a firearm using a three-dimensional printer.  The New Jersey State Commission of Investigation (SCI) recently issued a report which, in part, recommended establishing a crime for the possession of printing plans to manufacture firearms, and firearm components, including receivers or magazines. This bill implements the commissions recommendation.
