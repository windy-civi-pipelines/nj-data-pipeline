(cf: P.L.2019, c.419, s.1) 2.    Section 5 of P.L.1982, c.40 (C.54:40A-37.1) is amended to read as follows: [The sum of $1,000,000.00 of the tax collected pursuant to section 301 of P.L.1948, c.65 (C.54:40A-8),] Receipts collected from all fees for "Conquer Cancer" license plates pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1997, c.92 (C.39:3-27.90) shall be deposited by the State Treasurer in a special account to be known as the Cancer Research Fund [, except that for Fiscal Year 1983 only $500,000.00 shall be deposited in that account].  Moneys in the Cancer Research Fund shall be annually appropriated toward the funding of the New Jersey State Commission on Cancer Research established pursuant to P.L.1983, c.6 (C.52:9U-1 et seq.), or to projects authorized and approved by the commission. (cf: P.L.1990, c.39, s.18) 3.    Section 8 of P.L.1983, c.6 (C.52:9U-8) is repealed. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would establish a permanent new source of funding for the New Jersey Commission on Cancer Research from the Workforce Development Partnership Fund. The primary purpose of the Commission on Cancer Research is to promote significant and original research in New Jersey into the causes, prevention, treatment, and palliation of cancer and to serve as a resource to providers and consumers of cancer services. Since it was established in 1983, the commissions grants have helped to support over 500 cancer research projects, helping to launch the long and successful careers of cancer researchers in New Jersey. Under current statute, the New Jersey Commission on Cancer Research is meant to receive $1 million annually from the receipts from cigarette taxes.  However, this money has been diverted to fill other gaps in the budget in several recent years.  The bill would provide approximately the same amount of funding from the Workforce Development Partnership Fund.  The bill would not affect other sources of dedicated funding received by the commission, such revenue from sales of Conquer Cancer license plates; or the Breast Cancer, Lung Cancer, and Prostate Cancer Research Funds.
