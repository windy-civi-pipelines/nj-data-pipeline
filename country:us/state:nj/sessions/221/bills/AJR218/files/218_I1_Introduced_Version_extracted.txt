AJR218 ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION No. 218 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 6, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  ALEX SAUICKIE District 12 (Burlington, Middlesex, Monmouth and Ocean) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblyman Inganamort and Assemblywoman Fantasia SYNOPSIS Recognizes importance of nuclear energy in NJ. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution recognizing the importance of nuclear energy development in New Jersey. Whereas, New Jersey continues to lead the nation in developing clean energy sources, such as nuclear energy; and Whereas, Nuclear energy produces affordable carbon-free electricity thereby protecting the air from greenhouse gases and mitigating public health costs; and Whereas, Electricity produced by nuclear energy is two times more reliable than generation of electricity from natural gas and coal; and Whereas, Nuclear power plants store up to two years of fuel on-site, which provides a significant safety net against fuel supply chain disruptions; and Whereas, Nuclear power plants are built to withstand natural disasters and adversarial threats unlike other electricity generation facilities; and Whereas, Nuclear reactors account for 20 percent of the electricity supply without carbon emissions in the United States; and Whereas, In the United States, there are 93 nuclear reactors in 28 states, three of which are located in New Jersey; and Whereas, New Jerseys Salem and Hope Creek nuclear power plants generate 85 percent of the States carbon-free electricity and over 40 percent of the States total electricity; and Whereas, For more than 50 years, nuclear generation stations in New Jersey have provided reliable electric grid performance; and Whereas, Nuclear energy diversifies the States power supply, which is critical as the need for electricity for electric vehicles, industrial plants, and residential homes in the State steadily increases; and Whereas, It is important to continue to develop and promote nuclear energy as it not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions, but ensures New Jerseys leadership in nuclear technology and supports the States economy; and Whereas, Studies have shown that nuclear energy production saves New Jersey consumers more than $400 million annually compared to alternative sources of energy; and Whereas, By investing in nuclear power plants and research into nuclear energy, the State has the potential to create thousands of jobs and boost the economy; and Whereas, According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, for every 100 nuclear power plant jobs, 66 more jobs are created in the community; and Whereas, Nuclear energy worker salaries are around 50% higher than salaries of employees working in other types of electricity generation facilities; and Whereas, New Jerseys dedication to the continual operation of nuclear power plants complements the States goals of zero carbon emissions and creating alternative sources of energy production; and Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper for the New Jersey Legislature to recognize the importance of developing safe, reliable, affordable, and carbon-free nuclear energy; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The Legislature shall continue to promote and facilitate the development of nuclear energy in the State. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the President and each commissioner of the Board of Public Utilities and the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection. 3.  This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution recognizes the importance of developing nuclear energy as source of reliable, affordable, carbon-free electricity in the State.  Currently, there are three nuclear power plants in New Jersey which account for 42 percent of the electricity consumed in the State.  Not only do these nuclear power plants provide jobs for hundreds of individuals, but are the key to diversifying the available energy sources in New Jersey.  Developing nuclear power plants will foster alternative sources of energy which is critical to maintaining stable and reliable electricity generation Statewide.
