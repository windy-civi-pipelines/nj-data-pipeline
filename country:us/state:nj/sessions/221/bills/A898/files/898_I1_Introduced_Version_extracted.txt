The CRC will additionally be required to establish a process for medical cannabis dispensaries to apply for and receive reimbursement from the CRC for the amount of any subsidies applied to the purchase price of medical cannabis and medical cannabis products under the bill.  Reimbursements for the subsidies will be paid out of funds available through the Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Fund established pursuant to P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), or other funds made available to the CRC for this purpose.
