Data also shows that the State of New Jersey ranked third in the nation in anti-Semitic incidents last year. d. Anti-Semitism on campus is systemic, broad and deep, with recent studies showing that the number of Jewish students experiencing anti-Semitism across the United States had spiked to nearly 75 percent and, in 2017 alone, there were more than 204 reports of anti-Semitic incidents of harassment, vandalism, or assault against Jewish students on campus, an 89 percent increase from the previous year. e. State officials and institutions, including educational institutions, have a responsibility to protect citizens from hate and bigotry, and must be given the tools to stem both criminal conduct as well as discriminatory acts motivated by anti-Semitism. f.

The standard definition of anti-Semitism, as used by the federal government, the 34 governments that are members of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, all 57 countries, except Russia, that comprise the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the governments of the United Kingdom, Romania, Austria, Germany, and Bulgaria, has been an essential definitional tool used to determine contemporary manifestations of anti-Semitism, and includes useful examples of discriminatory anti-Israel acts that cross the line into anti-Semitism. h. Awareness of this definition of anti-Semitism will increase understanding of the parameters of contemporary anti-Jewish crime and discrimination. i. The Office of the Attorney General, through its Bias Crimes Reporting unit, plays a pivotal role in combatting anti-Semitism and ensuring that those responsible for bias crimes are brought to justice. j.  Raising public awareness on how to report bias crimes, particularly through the dedicated bias crime reporting hotline within the Office of the Attorney General, is crucial for fostering a safer environment for disadvantaged communities in New Jersey. 2. a.
