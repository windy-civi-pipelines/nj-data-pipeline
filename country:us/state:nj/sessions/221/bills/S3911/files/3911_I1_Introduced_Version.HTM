The Department of Environmental Protection may promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary to implement the requirements of P.L.2023, c.193 (C.13:1E-99.115a). f.     As used in this section: "Anaerobically digestible" means capable of undergoing anaerobic biological decomposition such that the material breaks down into a slurry fraction of digestate and a gaseous fraction of biogas. "Anaerobic digestion system" means a system of anaerobically digesting anaerobically digestible waste in which the waste is entirely enclosed, except for ventilation ducts or other means of ventilation, such that the material breaks down into, or otherwise becomes part of, liquid and solid digestate in addition to biogas. "Compostable" means capable of undergoing aerobic biological decomposition such that the material breaks down into, or otherwise become part of, usable compost in a safe and timely manner. "In-vessel composting system" means a system of composting compostable waste in which the waste is entirely enclosed, except for ventilation ducts or other means of ventilation, within a building, container, or other vessel. "School" means a public or nonpublic elementary or secondary school offering education in grades K through 12, or any combination thereof, at which a child may legally fulfill compulsory school attendance requirements , or a college, community college, university, or other institution of higher education. (cf:  P.L.2023, c.193, s.1) 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would expand the definition of "school" in section 1 of P.L.2023, c.193 (C.13:1E-99.115a) to include colleges, community colleges, universities, and other institutions of higher education.  This statute authorizes schools to send, receive, and compost food waste without a permit from the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), under certain conditions.
