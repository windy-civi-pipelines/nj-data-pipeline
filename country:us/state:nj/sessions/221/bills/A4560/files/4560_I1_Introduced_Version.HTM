establishing an expedited process for approving spending plan expenditures for
emergent opportunities to create affordable housing after a municipality has
obtained compliance certification and procedures for monitoring the collection and
expenditure of trust funds.  The department shall develop and publish on the

down the cost of low-income units in a municipal fair share plan to make them
affordable to households earning 30 percent or less of median income.  The use
of development fees in this manner shall not entitle a municipality to bonus
credits except as may otherwise be allowed by applicable precedent.</p>

share obligation and the development of its housing element and fair share plan
pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection f. of section 3 of P.L.2024,
c.2 (C.52:27D-304.1 et al.), and for expenses that are reasonably necessary for

costs to the municipality of resolving a challenge under the program.</p>

trust fund by the time set forth in this section shall be required by the
council to transfer the remaining unspent balance at the end of the four-year
period to the &quot;New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund,&quot; established
