A3133 ASSEMBLY, No. 3133 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  CLEOPATRA G. TUCKER District 28 (Essex and Union) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblymen Simonsen, McClellan, Atkins, Assemblywomen Matsikoudis, Haider, Assemblyman Sampson, Assemblywomen Reynolds-Jackson and Park SYNOPSIS Establishes position of Youth Disconnection Prevention and Recovery Ombudsperson; establishes School Disconnection Prevention Task Force. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning disconnected youth and supplementing chapter 4 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a. New Jersey and the nation have experienced an increase in the number of disconnected youth, which are young adults aged 16 to 24 who are disconnected from both school and employment. b. In New Jersey, more than 100,000 students were disconnected from school in 2021. c. Disconnection from school can negatively impact a student and their family and can have an enduring economic and social impact on the local community and society at large. d. Despite common misconceptions, youth disconnection is not consigned to a singular demographic region or racial or ethnic group, as youth disconnection rates are high across all counties and racial and ethnic groups. e. While the challenge of reengaging disconnected youth has persisted for decades, the COVID-19 pandemic illuminated and exacerbated youth disconnection, making it an issue that should urgently be addressed. f. It is altogether fitting and proper that the State ensure all young people receive the resources and support to achieve their educational and postsecondary goals by providing prevention and intervention strategies for reengaging disconnected youth across the State. 2.    As used in this act, disconnected youth means youth and young adults aged 16 to 24 who are not currently attending school, participating in a training program, or employed. 3.    a. There is hereby established in the Department of Education a Youth Disconnection Prevention and Recovery Ombudsperson. The Youth Disconnection Prevention and Recovery Ombudsperson shall be appointed by the Governor and shall serve at the pleasure of the Governor. The Governor shall appoint the ombudsperson no later than the 90th day following the date of enactment of this act. The ombudsperson shall report directly to the Commissioner of Education and shall only be answerable to the commissioner. The ombudsperson shall maintain a collaborative relationship with the Secretary of Higher Education. The ombudsperson shall implement a Statewide strategic plan of action to prevent students aged 16 to 24 from disconnecting from school, address the need for the reengagement of disconnected youth, and develop strategies to increase reengagement. b.  The ombudsperson shall serve for a term of four years and until the appointment and qualification of a successor. A vacancy occurring in the position of the ombudsperson shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment, except that if the ombudsperson dies, resigns, becomes ineligible to serve for any reason, or is removed from office, the Governor shall appoint an acting ombudsperson who shall serve until the appointment and qualification of the ombudspersons successor. The ombudsperson shall be a person of recognized judgment, integrity, and objectivity, and shall be skilled in communication, conflict resolution, and professionalism. The ombudsperson shall have hands-on practical experience working with disconnected youth and demonstrated higher-level leadership in an agency, institution, or organization that directly or indirectly addresses the subject of disconnected youth. 4.    The duties of the Youth Disconnection Prevention and Recovery Ombudsperson established pursuant to section 3 of this act shall include, but not be limited to: a. collaborating with school districts to develop and implement a Statewide strategic plan of action to prevent students aged 16 to 24 from disconnecting from school; b. collaborating with other agencies to address the challenges facing student dropouts, which agencies shall include the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Human Services, the Department of Corrections, the Juvenile Justice Commission, and the Department of Children and Families; c. addressing issues associated with the reengagement of students and developing programs to facilitate the return of disconnected students to the classroom; d. developing and recommending to school districts programs and best practices, consistent with the recommendations of the School Disconnection Prevention Task Force established pursuant to this act, to prevent students from disconnecting from school and strategies for reengaging students who have disconnected from school; e. collaborating with the Secretary of Higher Education to develop and establish best practices for reengaging disconnected youth in institutions of higher education; and f. advising the Commissioner of Education and making recommendations, consistent with the recommendations of the School Disconnection Prevention Task Force established pursuant to section 6 of this act, to prevent students from disconnecting from school and strategies for reengaging students who have disconnected from school. 5.    a.
