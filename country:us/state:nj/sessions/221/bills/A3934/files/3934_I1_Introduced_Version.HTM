Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 1 of P.L.1982,
c.163 (C.18A:17-46) is amended to read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Any school employee
observing or having direct knowledge from a participant or victim of an act of
violence shall, in accordance with standards established by the commissioner, file
a report describing the incident to the school principal in a manner prescribed
by the commissioner, and copy of same shall be forwarded to the district
superintendent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The principal shall notify the
district superintendent of schools of the action taken regarding the incident. 
Two times each school year, between September 1 and January 1 and between
January 1 and June 30, at a public hearing, the superintendent of schools shall
report to the board of education all acts of violence, vandalism, and harassment,
intimidation, or bullying which occurred during the previous reporting period. 
The report shall include the number of reports of harassment, intimidation, or
bullying, the status of all investigations, the nature of the bullying based on
one of the protected categories identified in section 2 of P.L.2002, c.83
(C.18A:37-14), the names of the investigators, the type and nature of any
discipline imposed on any student engaged in harassment, intimidation, or
bullying, and any other measures imposed, training conducted, or programs
implemented, to reduce harassment, intimidation, or bullying.  The information
shall also be reported once during each reporting period to the Department of
Education.  The report must include data broken down by the enumerated
categories as listed in section 2 of P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-14), and data
broken down by each school in the district, in addition to district-wide data. 
It shall be a violation to improperly release any confidential information not
authorized by federal or State law for public release.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The report shall be used to
grade each school for the purpose of assessing its effort to implement policies
and programs consistent with the provisions of P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-13 et
seq.).  The district shall receive a grade determined by averaging the grades
of all the schools in the district.  The commissioner shall promulgate
guidelines <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>for
a program<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
to grade schools for the purposes of this section <u>, and shall annually
update the guidelines to assess the efforts of each school in developing,
fostering, and maintaining a positive school climate</u>.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The grade received by a school
and the district shall be posted on the homepage of the school's website.  The
grade for the district and each school of the district shall be posted on the
homepage of the district's website.  A link to the report shall be available on
the district's website.  The information shall be posted on the websites within
10 days of the receipt of a grade by the school and district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a school district's policy
permits a preliminary determination to be made on whether a reported incident
or complaint is a report outside the scope of the definition of harassment,
intimidation, or bullying pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-14),
the superintendent shall also provide annually to the board of education
information on the number of times a preliminary determination was made that an
incident or complaint was outside the scope of that definition for the purposes
of the State's monitoring of the school district. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Verification of the reports on
violence, vandalism, and harassment, intimidation, or bullying shall be part of
the State's monitoring of the school district, and the State Board of Education
shall adopt regulations that impose a penalty on a school employee who
knowingly falsifies the report.  A board of education shall provide ongoing
staff training, in cooperation with the Department of Education, in fulfilling
the reporting requirements pursuant to this section.  The majority
representative of the school employees shall have access monthly to the number
and disposition of all reported acts of school violence, vandalism, and
harassment, intimidation, or bullying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2021, c.338, s.2)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 5 of P.L.2002,
c.83 (C.18A:37-17) is amended to read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.  a.  Schools and school
districts shall annually establish, implement, document, and assess bullying
prevention programs or approaches, and other initiatives involving school
staff, students, administrators, volunteers, parents, law enforcement and
community members.  The programs or approaches shall be designed to create
school-wide conditions to prevent and address harassment, intimidation, and
bullying.  A school district may implement bullying prevention programs and
approaches that may be available at no cost from the Department of Education,
the New Jersey State Bar Foundation, or any other entity.  A school district
may, at its own discretion, implement bullying prevention programs and
approaches which impose a cost on the district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A school district may apply to
the Department of Education for a grant to be used for programs, approaches, or
