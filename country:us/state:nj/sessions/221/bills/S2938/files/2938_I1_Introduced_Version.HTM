appropriation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 13 of P.L.1991,
c.261 (C.2C:25-29) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     13.  a.  A hearing shall be
held in the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court within
10 days of the filing of a complaint pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261
(C.2C:25-28) in the county where the ex parte restraints were ordered, unless
good cause is shown for the hearing to be held elsewhere.  A copy of the
complaint shall be served on the defendant in conformity with the Rules of
Court. If a criminal complaint arising out of the same incident which is the
subject matter of a complaint brought under P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et seq.)
or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.) has been filed, testimony given by the
plaintiff or defendant in the domestic violence matter shall not be used in the
simultaneous or subsequent criminal proceeding against the defendant, other
than domestic violence contempt matters and where it would otherwise be
admissible hearsay under the rules of evidence that govern where a party is
unavailable.  At the hearing the standard for proving the allegations in the
complaint shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.  The court shall
consider but not be limited to the following factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The previous history of
domestic violence between the plaintiff and defendant, including threats,
harassment and physical abuse; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The existence of
immediate danger to person or property; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The financial
circumstances of the plaintiff and defendant; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The best interests of
the victim and any child; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   In determining custody
and parenting time the protection of the victim's safety; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The existence of a
verifiable order of protection from another jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An order issued under this act
shall only restrain or provide damages payable from a person against whom a
complaint has been filed under this act and only after a finding or an
admission is made that an act of domestic violence was committed by that
person.  The issue of whether or not a violation of this act occurred,
including an act of contempt under this act, shall not be subject to mediation
or negotiation in any form.  In addition, where a temporary or final order has
been issued pursuant to this act, no party shall be ordered to participate in
mediation on the issue of custody or parenting time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In proceedings in which
complaints for restraining orders have been filed, the court shall grant any
relief necessary to prevent further abuse.  In addition to any other
provisions, any restraining order issued by the court shall bar the defendant
from purchasing, owning, possessing or controlling a firearm and from receiving
or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a
handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3 during the period in which the restraining
order is in effect or two years, whichever is greater. The order shall require
the immediate surrender of any firearm or other weapon belonging to the
defendant.  The order shall include notice to the defendant of the penalties
for a violation of any provision of the order, including but not limited to the
penalties for contempt of court and unlawful possession of a firearm or other
weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A law enforcement officer shall
accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if necessary, to
any place where any firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant is
located to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any firearm or
other weapon, and a law enforcement officer shall take custody of any firearm
or other weapon belonging to the defendant.  If the order prohibits the
defendant from returning to the scene of domestic violence or other place where
firearms or other weapons belonging to the defendant are located, any firearm
or other weapon located there shall be seized by a law enforcement officer. 
The provisions of this subsection requiring the surrender or removal of a
firearm, card, or permit shall not apply to any law enforcement officer while
actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States or
member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to or from an
authorized place of duty.  At the hearing the judge of the Family Part of the
Chancery Division of the Superior Court may issue an order granting any or all
of the following relief:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   An order restraining the
defendant from subjecting the victim to domestic violence, as defined in this
act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   An order granting
exclusive possession to the plaintiff of the residence or household regardless
of whether the residence or household is jointly or solely owned by the parties
or jointly or solely leased by the parties.  This order shall not in any manner
affect title or interest to any real property held by either party or both
jointly.  If it is not possible for the victim to remain in the residence, the
court may order the defendant to pay the victim's rent at a residence other
than the one previously shared by the parties if the defendant is found to have
a duty to support the victim and the victim requires alternative housing.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   An order providing for
parenting time.  The order shall protect the safety and well-being of the
plaintiff and minor children and shall specify the place<u>, location to exchange
the minor children,</u> and frequency of parenting time.  Parenting time
arrangements shall <u>specify, at the plaintiffs request, that exchanges of
the minor children shall take place at a neutral safe exchange zone,
established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill); provided however that the parenting time
arrangements shall</u> not compromise any other remedy provided by the court by
requiring or encouraging contact between the plaintiff and defendant.  Orders
for parenting time may include a designation of a place of parenting time away
from the plaintiff, the participation of a third party, or supervised parenting
time.</p>
