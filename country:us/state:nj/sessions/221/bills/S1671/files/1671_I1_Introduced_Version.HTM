Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.  A state of emergency
declaration issued by the Governor pursuant to P.L.1942, c.251 (C.App.A:9-33 et
seq.) may be terminated by the Legislature by concurrent resolution if the
resolution receives a two-thirds affirmative vote of the authorized membership
of each House of the Legislature.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A state of emergency
declaration issued by the Governor pursuant to P.L.1942, c.251 (C.App.A:9-33 et
seq.) shall terminate automatically 60 days after the date of issuance unless
an extension is authorized by the Legislature.  The Legislature may authorize,
after a notice required in subsection e. of this section is received, as many
extensions of not less than 30 days, but not more than 90 days, by concurrent
resolution as receive a majority vote of the authorized membership of each
House of the Legislature. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The Governor shall not
issue for the same emergency a declaration to the same or substantially same
effect as one that has been terminated pursuant to subsection a. of this
section or section 3 of this act, P.L.   , c.    (C.   )(pending before the
Legislature as this bill), except in accordance with a law that permits the
issuance of another declaration specifically for that emergency.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The Legislature may
conduct the vote on any concurrent resolution specified in this section or in
section 3 of this act, P.L.   , c.       (C.      )(pending before the
Legislature as this bill), by any means it deems necessary and appropriate,
including, but not limited to, in person, by teleconference, and remotely by
electronic means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  For the purpose of this
section, same emergency means the initial event or events that gave rise to
the emergency declaration that has been terminated, and any event that occurs
subsequent to the initial event or events as a direct result, continuation, or
consequence of the initial event or events or the origin of which can be traced
directly to the initial event or events.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The Governor shall notify
the Legislature in writing of the need for an extension of any state of
emergency declaration issued pursuant to P.L.1942, c.251 (C.App.A:9-33 et seq.)
at least seven business days before an extension is authorized by the
Legislature pursuant to subsection a. of this section.  The notice shall
provide information on the need for the extension of such declaration and the
threat to the public health or safety that requires the extension. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     When notice cannot be given at
least seven business days before an extension is authorized by the Legislature,
the notice shall be given by the Governor as soon as possible, but not later
than at least 24 hours before the extension is authorized, and the notice shall
include an explanation of why the notice could not have been given at least
seven days before the extension.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  The Governor shall receive
and publish in the New Jersey Register any comments from the chairs and ranking
minority members of the relevant standing reference committees of the
Legislature on any notice given in accordance with subsection e. of this section. 
The publication shall include a response from the Executive Branch.  The
comments may be received before or after an extension is granted pursuant to
this act, P.L.   , c.   (pending before the Legislate as this bill), and shall
not affect the validity thereof.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  If the Governor fails to
provide the notice required by subsection e. of this section for an extension,
the state of emergency declaration shall terminate unless an extension of the
declaration is approved, after the notice required in subsection e. of this
section is received, by the Legislature by concurrent resolution that receives
a majority vote of the authorized membership of each House of the Legislature. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  This section shall not
apply to any declaration:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) rescinding an order, rule,
or regulation issued pursuant to P.L.1942, c.251 (C.App.A:9-33 et seq.);</p>

any or all of the executive and administrative offices, departments, and
instrumentalities of the Executive Branch of State government; or</p>

emergency declaration issued by the Governor pursuant to P.L.2005, c.222
(C.26:13-1 et seq.) may be terminated by the Legislature by concurrent
resolution if the resolution receives a two-thirds affirmative vote of the
authorized membership of each House of the Legislature.  </p>
