The bill would apply to hospital, medical, and health service corporations; commercial individual, small employer, and larger group insurers; health maintenance organizations; and the State Health Benefits Program and the School Employees Health Benefits Program.

STATEMENT This bill requires health benefits coverage for an additional prosthetic appliance under certain circumstances. The bill requires health benefits coverage for an additional orthotic or prosthetic appliance from any licensed orthotist or prosthetist, or any certified pedorthist, if the covered persons physician determines that the additional appliance is necessary to enable the covered person to engage in physical and recreational activities, including running, bicycling, swimming, climbing, skiing, snowboarding, and team and individual sports.  The reimbursement for the additional orthotic or prosthetic appliance is at the same rate as reimbursement for the appliances under the federal Medicare reimbursement schedule. Current law requires health benefits coverage for expenses incurred in obtaining an orthotic or prosthetic appliance from any licensed orthotist or prosthetist, or any certified pedorthist, as determined medically necessary by the covered person's physician, but does not require coverage of an additional appliance for physical or recreational activities. The bill would apply to hospital, medical, and health service corporations; commercial individual, small employer, and larger group insurers; health maintenance organizations; and the State Health Benefits Program and the School Employees Health Benefits Program.
