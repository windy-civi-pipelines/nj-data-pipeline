The selection process shall include visits to potential organizations to ascertain their commitment and ability to develop and implement arts-based programming specifically for juvenile offenders. d.    The commission shall provide for the inclusion of an evaluation component within the pilot program. The assessment methods designed to evaluate the model programs shall be based on best practices for assessing arts-based programming for juvenile offenders and youth, specifically their educational outcomes and student progress in problem solving, comprehension, critical thinking and reasoning, and positive development. During the initial four years of the pilot program each model program shall undergo an annual evaluation conducted by the commission.  After the programs fourth year, the commission shall submit to the Governor, and to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), an evaluation of the pilot program and a recommendation on the advisability of its continuation and expansion within the State. e.     The Juvenile Justice Commission, in consultation with the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately.

Under the bill, the commission is required to include an evaluation component in the pilot program.  The evaluation is to be based on best practices for assessing arts-based programming for juvenile offenders and youth and, specifically, their educational outcomes and student progress in problem solving, comprehension, critical thinking and reasoning, and positive development.  During the initial four years, each model program is required to undergo an annual evaluation conducted by the commission.  After the programs fourth year, the commission is to submit to the Governor and the Legislature an evaluation of the pilot program and a recommendation concerning whether the program should be continued and expanded within the State.
