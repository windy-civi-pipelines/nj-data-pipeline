This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes tax incentives for taxpayers whose upgrades to existing energy infrastructure creates an increase in electricity to the grid.  Specifically, the bill provides a tax credit against the corporation business tax and the gross income tax based on the costs of upgrades which result in an increase of at least five percent in energy generation that is transmitted to the States electrical grid.  The tax credit is available to anyone who is a generator and demonstrates a five percent increase in electric energy.  The bill defines generator as person owning, controlling, or operating a facility that produces electric energy for sale.  The amount of the credit is equal to the lesser of: 75 percent of the total costs of upgrades made after the bills effective date or $5,000,000. Under the bill, the taxpayer is required to provide the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) a certification that shows: 1) the upgrades made to the existing energy production infrastructure owned and operated by the taxpayer; 2) the amount, in kilowatt hours, of energy produced as a result of upgrades along with the amount, in kilowatt hours, of energy produced prior to the upgrades; and 3) the amount of the tax credit. The application to BPU should demonstrate how exactly the upgrades were able to create an increase, of at least five percent, in electricity transmitted to the grid.  These upgrades may include, but are not limited to: improving energy efficiency, enhancing equipment technologies, integration of distributed energy and storage resources, and increased integration of renewable energy sources and storage systems.  Additionally, the application should include receipts and documentation identifying the type and cost of each upgrade necessary to increase power production and any other information determined relevant by the board. The bill requires BPU to transmit a copy of any certification issued to the taxpayer and the Director of the Division of Taxation in Department of the Treasury (director).  The bill would also limit the cumulative total of tax credits awarded pursuant to the bill to $100 million.  The bill would require, no later than five years after the bills effective date, the division to prepare and submit to the Governor, the State Treasurer, and the Legislature a report that, at a minimum, summarizes the effectiveness of the tax credit in incentivizing upgrades to existing energy generation infrastructure.  Finally, the bill directs BPU, in consultation with the director, to adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of the act.
