P.L.    , c.    (C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill),
and subject to the limitations of subsection c. of this section, a taxpayer who

the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), to be
calculated as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, to compensate the
taxpayer for certain costs incurred in the installation and deployment of upgrades
to an existing electric energy generation facility. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) To qualify for the tax
credit allowed pursuant to this section, a taxpayer shall apply, in a form and
manner determined by the board, to the board for a certification that provides:
(a) the upgrades made to the existing electric energy generation facility owned
or operated by the taxpayer; (b) the amount, in kilowatt hours, of electric energy
produced as a result of the upgrades along with the amount, in kilowatt hours,

liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection
e. of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  The amount of the tax credit
otherwise allowable under this section which cannot be applied for the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes tax
incentives for taxpayers whose upgrades to existing energy infrastructure
creates an increase in electricity to the grid.  Specifically, the bill
provides a tax credit against the corporation business tax and the gross income
tax based on the costs of upgrades which result in an increase of at least five
percent in energy generation that is transmitted to the States electrical
grid.  The tax credit is available to anyone who is a generator and
demonstrates a five percent increase in electric energy.  The bill defines
generator as <span style='color:black'>person owning, controlling, or operating
a facility that produces electric energy for sale.  </span>The amount of the
credit is equal to the lesser of: 75 percent of the total costs of upgrades
made after the bills effective date or $5,000,000.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the taxpayer
is required to provide the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) a certification that
shows: 1) the upgrades made to the existing energy production infrastructure
owned and operated by the taxpayer; 2) the amount, in kilowatt hours, of energy
produced as a result of upgrades along with the amount, in kilowatt hours, of
energy produced prior to the upgrades; and 3) the amount of the tax credit. 
The application to BPU should demonstrate how exactly the upgrades were able to
create an increase, of at least five percent, in electricity transmitted to the
grid.  These upgrades may include, but are not limited to: improving energy
efficiency, enhancing equipment technologies, integration of distributed energy
and storage resources, and increased integration of renewable energy sources
and storage systems.  Additionally, the application should include receipts and
documentation identifying the type and cost of each upgrade necessary to
increase power production and any other information determined relevant by the board. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires BPU to
transmit a copy of any certification issued to the taxpayer and the Director of
the Division of Taxation in Department of the Treasury (director).  <span
style='color:black'>The bill would also limit the cumulative total of tax
credits awarded pursuant to the bill to $100 million.</span>  The bill would
require, no later than five years after the bills effective date, the division
to prepare and submit to the Governor, the State Treasurer, and the Legislature
a report that, at a minimum, summarizes the effectiveness of the tax credit in
incentivizing upgrades to existing energy generation infrastructure.  Finally,
the bill directs BPU, in consultation with the director, to adopt rules and
regulations to effectuate the provisions of the act. </p>
