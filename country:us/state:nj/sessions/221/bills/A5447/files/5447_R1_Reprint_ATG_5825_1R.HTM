relief which may be obtained under any statute or court rule governing the

be a factor therein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  &quot;Gambling&quot; means

without receiving or becoming entitled to receive any  profit therefrom other
than personal gambling winnings, and without otherwise  rendering any material
assistance to the establishment, conduct or operation of  the particular
gambling activity.  A person who gambles at a social game of  chance on equal
terms with the other participants therein does not thereby  render material
assistance to the establishment, conduct or operation of such  game if he
performs, without fee or remuneration, acts directed toward the  arrangement or
facilitation of the game, such as inviting persons to play,  permitting the use
of premises therefor or supplying cards or other equipment  used therein.  A

therein, or involving extension of a service, entertainment or a  privilege of
playing at a game or scheme without charge. This definition,  however, does not

device&quot;  means any device, machine, paraphernalia or equipment which is
used or usable in the playing phases of any gambling activity, whether such
activity consists of gambling between persons or gambling by a person involving
the playing of a machine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, lottery tickets,
policy slips and other items used in the playing phases of lottery and policy
schemes are not gambling devices.</p>

operation of which, whether by reason of the skill of  the operator or
application of the element of chance, or both, may deliver or  entitle the
person playing or operating the machine to receive cash or tokens  to be
exchanged for cash, whether the payoff is made automatically from the  machine
or in any other manner whatsoever.  A device so constructed, or readily 
adaptable or convertible to such use, is no less a slot machine because it is 
not in working order or because some mechanical act of manipulation or repair 
is required to accomplish its adaptation, conversion or workability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  &quot;Bookmaking&quot;

an unlawful gambling scheme in which (a) the players pay or agree to pay
something of value for chances, represented and differentiated by numbers or by
combinations of numbers or by some other media,  one or more of which chances
are to be designated the winning ones; and (b)  the winning chances are to be
determined by a drawing or by some other method  based upon the element of

of value.</p>

on the part of persons conducting or connected with the scheme, but  upon the
basis of the outcome or outcomes of a future contingent event or events
otherwise unrelated to the particular scheme.</p>
