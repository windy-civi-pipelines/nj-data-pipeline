This definition,  however, does not include any form of promise involving extension of a  privilege of playing at a game without charge on a mechanical or electronic  amusement device, other than a slot machine as an award for the attainment of a  certain score on that device. e.  "Gambling device"  means any device, machine, paraphernalia or equipment which is used or usable in the playing phases of any gambling activity, whether such activity consists of gambling between persons or gambling by a person involving the playing of a machine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, lottery tickets, policy slips and other items used in the playing phases of lottery and policy schemes are not gambling devices. f.  "Slot machine" means any mechanical, electrical or other device, contrivance or machine which, upon insertion of a coin, token or similar object  therein, or upon payment of any consideration whatsoever, is available to play  or operate, the play or operation of which, whether by reason of the skill of  the operator or application of the element of chance, or both, may deliver or  entitle the person playing or operating the machine to receive cash or tokens  to be exchanged for cash, whether the payoff is made automatically from the  machine or in any other manner whatsoever.  A device so constructed, or readily adaptable or convertible to such use, is no less a slot machine because it is not in working order or because some mechanical act of manipulation or repair is required to accomplish its adaptation, conversion or workability. g.  "Bookmaking" means advancing gambling activity by unlawfully accepting  bets from members of the public upon the outcome of future contingent events as  a business. h.  "Lottery"  means an unlawful gambling scheme in which (a) the players pay or agree to pay something of value for chances, represented and differentiated by numbers or by combinations of numbers or by some other media,  one or more of which chances are to be designated the winning ones; and (b)  the winning chances are to be determined by a drawing or by some other method  based upon the element of chance;  and (c) the holders of the winning chances  are to receive something of value. i.  "Policy"  or "the numbers game"  means a form of lottery in which the  winning chances or plays are not determined upon the basis of a drawing or  other act on the part of persons conducting or connected with the scheme, but  upon the basis of the outcome or outcomes of a future contingent event or events otherwise unrelated to the particular scheme. j.  "Gambling resort"  means a place to which persons may resort for engaging in gambling activity. k.  "Unlawful" means not specifically authorized by law. l.  Online gambling resort means a website or application accessed via the Internet or other computer or mobile connection to which persons may resort for engaging in gambling activity. (cf: P.L.1982, c.60, s.1) 27.  N.J.S.2C:37-2 is amended to read as follows: 2C:37-2.  Promoting Gambling. a.  Promoting Gambling Defined. A person is guilty of promoting gambling when [he] the person knowingly: (1)  Accepts or receives money or other property, pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any person whereby [he] the person participates or will participate in the proceeds of gambling activity, including, but not limited to gambling activity that occurs online, unless such gambling activity is under the regulation and control of the State; or (2)  Engages in conduct, which materially aids any form of gambling activity.  Such conduct includes but is not limited to conduct directed toward the creation or establishment of the particular game, contest, scheme, device or activity involved, toward the acquisition or maintenance of premises, paraphernalia, equipment or apparatus therefor, toward the solicitation or inducement of persons to participate therein, toward the actual conduct of the playing phases thereof, toward the arrangement of any of its financial or recording phases, or toward any other phase of its operation. b.  Grading.  A person who violates the provisions of subsection a. of this section by: (1)  Engaging in bookmaking to the extent [he] the person receives or accepts in any one day more than five bets totaling more than $1,000.00; or (2)  Receiving, in connection with a lottery or policy scheme or enterprise (a) money or written records from a person other than a player whose chances or plays are represented by such money or records, or (b) more than $100.00 in any one day of money played in such scheme or enterprise, is guilty of a crime of the third degree and notwithstanding the provisions of section 2C:43-3 shall be subject to a fine of not more than $35,000.00 and any other appropriate disposition authorized by [N.J.S.2C:43-2 b] subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-2. A person who violates the provisions of subsection a. of this section by engaging in bookmaking to the extent [he] the person receives or accepts three or more bets in any two-week period is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree and notwithstanding the provisions of section 2C:43-3 shall be subject to a fine of not more than $25,000.00 and any other appropriate disposition authorized by [N.J.S.2C:43-2b] subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-2.  Otherwise, promoting gambling is a disorderly persons offense and notwithstanding the provisions of section 2C:43-3 shall be subject to a fine of not more than $10,000.00 and any other appropriate disposition authorized by [N.J.S.2C:43-2b] subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-2. c.  It is [a] an affirmative defense to a prosecution under subsection a. that the person participated only as  a player.  [It shall be the burden of the defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence his status as such player.] (cf: P.L.1997, c.181, s.9) 28.  N.J.S.2C:37-4 is amended to read as follows: 2C:37-4.  Maintenance of a Gambling Resort or Online Gambling Resort. a.  A person is guilty of a crime of the [fourth] third degree if, having substantial proprietary or other authoritative control over premises which are being used with his knowledge for purposes of activities prohibited by N.J.S.2C:37-2 and N.J.S.2C:37-3, [he] the person permits such to occur or continue or makes no effort to prevent its occurrence or continuation and [he] the person accepts or receives money or other property pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any person whereby [he] the person participates or will participate in the proceeds of such gambling activity on such premises and notwithstanding the provisions of section 2C:43-3 shall be subject to a fine of not more than [$25,000.00] $50,000 and any other appropriate disposition authorized by [N.J.S.2C:43-2b] subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-2. b.  A person is guilty of a crime of the [fourth] third degree if, having substantial proprietary or other authoritative control over premises open to the general public which are being used with [his] the persons knowledge for purposes of gambling activity, [he] the person permits such to occur or continue or makes no effort to prevent its occurrence or continuation and notwithstanding the provisions of section 2C:43-3 shall be subject to a fine of not more than [$25,000.00] $50,000 and any other appropriate disposition authorized by [N.J.S.2C:43-2b] subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-2. c.     A person is guilty of a crime of the third degree if the person operates or maintains an online gambling resort through which persons from within New Jersey are permitted to wager unless such gambling activity is under the regulation and control of the State and, notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.2C:43-3, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $50,000 nor more than $100,000 and any other appropriate disposition authorized by subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-2. (cf: P.L.1997, c.181, s.11) 29.  Section 113 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-113) is amended to read as follows: 113. Swindling and Cheating; Penalties. a.     A person is guilty of swindling and cheating if the person: (1) purposely or knowingly by any trick or sleight of hand performance or by a fraud or fraudulent scheme, cards, dice or device, for [himself or herself] themselves or for another, wins or attempts to win money or property or a representative of either or reduces a losing wager or attempts to reduce a losing wager in connection to casino gaming, Internet gaming, or sports wagering; (2)  purposely or knowingly places any sports wager having knowledge of information not available to the general public bearing upon that wager and wins, or attempts to win, money or property or a representative of either; or (3)  with the purpose to deceive, uses another persons gaming account, including, but not limited to, a wagering account for Internet gaming or sports wagering, to place a wager and wins, or attempts to win, money or property or a representative of either. b.    Consolidation of offenses.  Conduct denominated swindling and cheating in this section constitutes a single offense, but each episode or transaction may be the subject of a separate prosecution and conviction.  A charge of swindling and cheating may be supported by evidence that it was committed in any manner that would be swindling and cheating under this section, notwithstanding the specification of a different manner in the indictment or accusation, subject only to the power of the court to ensure a fair trial by granting a bill of particulars, discovery, continuance, or other appropriate relief when the conduct of the defense would be prejudiced by a lack of fair notice or by surprise. c.     Grading of swindling and cheating offenses.

Each debt that is due and payable and required to be collected, and any monetary penalty imposed for a violation of section 2 through section 12 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall constitute a lien on the real property in this State owned or hereafter acquired by the person owing such a debt or on whom such an obligation has been imposed.  Except as otherwise provided in R.S.54:5-9, such a lien shall be a first lien paramount to all prior or subsequent liens, claims, or encumbrances on that property. 14.  (New section)  In addition to any other authority provided under law, whenever it shall appear to the Division of Gaming Enforcement that a violation of section 112 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-112) or unlawful gambling in violation of Article IV, Section VII, paragraph 2 of the New Jersey Constitution, other than a sweepstakes offered or conducted in violation of section 2 of P.L.    , c.

(cf: P.L.1986, c.129, s.2) 26.  N.J.S.2C:37-1 is amended to read as follows: 2C:37-1. The following definitions apply to this chapter and to chapter 64: a.  "Contest of chance"  means any contest, game, pool, gaming scheme or gaming device in which the outcome depends in a material degree upon an element  of chance, notwithstanding that skill of the contestants or some other persons  may also be a factor therein. b.  "Gambling" means staking or risking something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under the actor's control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that [he] the actor will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome, or buying, selling, or trading something of value upon an agreement or understanding that the actor will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome in a contest of chance.  For purposes of this subsection, a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under the actors control or influence shall include, but need not be limited to, a sports event on which a wager may be placed with a sports wagering licensee pursuant to P.L.2018, c.33 (C.5:12A-10 et al.). c.  "Player"  means a person who engages in any form of gambling solely as  a contestant or bettor, without receiving or becoming entitled to receive any  profit therefrom other than personal gambling winnings, and without otherwise  rendering any material assistance to the establishment, conduct or operation of  the particular gambling activity.  A person who gambles at a social game of  chance on equal terms with the other participants therein does not thereby  render material assistance to the establishment, conduct or operation of such  game if he performs, without fee or remuneration, acts directed toward the  arrangement or facilitation of the game, such as inviting persons to play,  permitting the use of premises therefor or supplying cards or other equipment  used therein.  A person who engages in  "bookmaking"  as defined in this  section is not a "player." d.  "Something of value"  means any money or property, any token, object or  article exchangeable for money or property, or any form of credit or promise  directly or indirectly contemplating transfer of money or property or of any  interest therein, or involving extension of a service, entertainment or a  privilege of playing at a game or scheme without charge. This definition,  however, does not include any form of promise involving extension of a  privilege of playing at a game without charge on a mechanical or electronic  amusement device, other than a slot machine as an award for the attainment of a  certain score on that device. e.  "Gambling device"  means any device, machine, paraphernalia or equipment which is used or usable in the playing phases of any gambling activity, whether such activity consists of gambling between persons or gambling by a person involving the playing of a machine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, lottery tickets, policy slips and other items used in the playing phases of lottery and policy schemes are not gambling devices. f.  "Slot machine" means any mechanical, electrical or other device, contrivance or machine which, upon insertion of a coin, token or similar object  therein, or upon payment of any consideration whatsoever, is available to play  or operate, the play or operation of which, whether by reason of the skill of  the operator or application of the element of chance, or both, may deliver or  entitle the person playing or operating the machine to receive cash or tokens  to be exchanged for cash, whether the payoff is made automatically from the  machine or in any other manner whatsoever.  A device so constructed, or readily adaptable or convertible to such use, is no less a slot machine because it is not in working order or because some mechanical act of manipulation or repair is required to accomplish its adaptation, conversion or workability. g.  "Bookmaking" means advancing gambling activity by unlawfully accepting  bets from members of the public upon the outcome of future contingent events as  a business. h.  "Lottery"  means an unlawful gambling scheme in which (a) the players pay or agree to pay something of value for chances, represented and differentiated by numbers or by combinations of numbers or by some other media,  one or more of which chances are to be designated the winning ones; and (b)  the winning chances are to be determined by a drawing or by some other method  based upon the element of chance;  and (c) the holders of the winning chances  are to receive something of value. i.  "Policy"  or "the numbers game"  means a form of lottery in which the  winning chances or plays are not determined upon the basis of a drawing or  other act on the part of persons conducting or connected with the scheme, but  upon the basis of the outcome or outcomes of a future contingent event or events otherwise unrelated to the particular scheme. j.  "Gambling resort"  means a place to which persons may resort for engaging in gambling activity. k.  "Unlawful" means not specifically authorized by law. l.  Online gambling resort means a website or application accessed via the Internet or other computer or mobile connection to which persons may resort for engaging in gambling activity. (cf: P.L.1982, c.60, s.1) 27.  N.J.S.2C:37-2 is amended to read as follows: 2C:37-2.  Promoting Gambling. a.  Promoting Gambling Defined.

Swindling and Cheating; Penalties. a.     A person is guilty of swindling and cheating if the person: (1) purposely or knowingly by any trick or sleight of hand performance or by a fraud or fraudulent scheme, cards, dice or device, for [himself or herself] themselves or for another, wins or attempts to win money or property or a representative of either or reduces a losing wager or attempts to reduce a losing wager in connection to casino gaming, Internet gaming, or sports wagering; (2)  purposely or knowingly places any sports wager having knowledge of information not available to the general public bearing upon that wager and wins, or attempts to win, money or property or a representative of either; or (3)  with the purpose to deceive, uses another persons gaming account, including, but not limited to, a wagering account for Internet gaming or sports wagering, to place a wager and wins, or attempts to win, money or property or a representative of either. b.    Consolidation of offenses.  Conduct denominated swindling and cheating in this section constitutes a single offense, but each episode or transaction may be the subject of a separate prosecution and conviction.  A charge of swindling and cheating may be supported by evidence that it was committed in any manner that would be swindling and cheating under this section, notwithstanding the specification of a different manner in the indictment or accusation, subject only to the power of the court to ensure a fair trial by granting a bill of particulars, discovery, continuance, or other appropriate relief when the conduct of the defense would be prejudiced by a lack of fair notice or by surprise. c.     Grading of swindling and cheating offenses.
