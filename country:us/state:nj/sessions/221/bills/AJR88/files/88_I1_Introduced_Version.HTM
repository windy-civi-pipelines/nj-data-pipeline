STATEMENT This joint resolution adopts a working definition of antisemitism for the State of New Jersey. Antisemitism, as well as discrimination, harassment, bias, and bigotry against those who are or who are perceived to be Jewish or have Jewish heritage remains prevalent throughout the world, including throughout the United States and in New Jersey and has both historical and contemporary contexts. According to data compiled by the New Jersey State Police, as of April 2022, anti-Jewish bias was cited as a motivation for 298 reported bias incidents in 2020 and 347 reported bias incidents in 2021. According to the Anti-Defamation League, one in four Jews in the United States reported having been impacted by antisemitism in 2021.  In recent months, the country has witnessed a disturbing trend of public figures making comments, supporting viewpoints, and meeting with individuals that are widely regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism is closely linked to other forms of bigotry and hatred.  New Jersey law criminalizes acts of bias intimidation, defined as certain offenses committed with the purpose to intimidate or with the knowledge that the offense would intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of, among other protected characteristics, religion, ethnicity, or national origin. New Jersey law prohibits discrimination and bias-based harassment in employment, housing, and places of public accommodation on the basis of, among other protected characteristics, actual or perceived religion, ethnicity, ancestry, or national origin.  Despite these prohibitions, many acts and occurrences of bias and bigotry go unreported or unaddressed.  It is the responsibility of the State of New Jersey to reject and speak out against bias and bigotry, including condemning antisemitism in all its forms. A critical component of combatting antisemitism is understanding what antisemitism is.  The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) is a thirty five-member intergovernmental organization created to focus on antisemitism and Holocaust-related issues.  The IHRA has adopted a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, illuminated by useful examples, illustrations, and distinctions, to help guide and empower governments to understand and address the rise in hate and discrimination against Jews and those with Jewish heritage. The working definition of antisemitism may be used as an education and training tool for public officials, law enforcement offices, educators, and other public and private employees so that they may effectively raise awareness of and call out antisemitism and understand its impact.  38 countries including the United States have adopted or endorsed the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, as have several state and local governments. The working definition, as adopted by the IHRA on May 26, 2016, reads: Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.  Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.  The IHRA also notes, in the context of defining the concept of antisemitism, that criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. This working definition of antisemitism is intended as an analytical and educational tool and is not legally binding, and thus is not intended to diminish or infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, or paragraph 6 of Article I of the New Jersey State Constitution.
