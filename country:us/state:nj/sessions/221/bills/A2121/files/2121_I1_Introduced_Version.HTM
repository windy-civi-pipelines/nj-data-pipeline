financing company from extending student financing or a private education loan
to a New Jersey resident without first registering with the Commissioner of
Banking and Insurance and with the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and
Registry. Creditors, lenders, and student financing companies are required to
provide the commissioner, at the time of registration and not less than once
per year thereafter, certain information about the entities and the student
loans that they provide.  The commissioner is required to post on the
departments website information about private education lenders registered in
the State.  The bill also requires creditors, lenders, and student financing
companies to post on their websites a copy of each model promissory note,
agreement, contract or other instrument used by the creditor, lender, or
student financing company to substantiate a private education loan.  The bill
provides that the commissioner may impose a civil penalty not exceeding $25,000

letter-spacing:0pt'>      The bill requires private education lenders to
deliver certain information to a cosigner related to impacts on the cosigner in
certain circumstances, prior to the extension of a private education loan that
requires a cosigner.  For any private education loan that obligates a cosigner
and provides for cosigner release, a lender is required to provide the borrower
and the cosigner an annual written or electronic notice containing clear and conspicuous
information about cosigner release.  Under the bill, if the borrower has met
the applicable payment requirement to be eligible for cosigner release, the
lender must send the borrower and the cosigner a notification informing them
that the payments requirement to be eligible for cosigner release has been
met.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      The bill requires a lender to provide written notice
to a borrower who applies for cosigner release, but whose application is
incomplete. Within 30 days after a borrower submits a completed application for
cosigner release, the lender is required to send the borrower and cosigner a
written notice that informs them whether the cosigner release application has
been approved or denied.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      The bill prohibits a lender from imposing any
restriction that permanently bars a borrower from qualifying for cosigner
release.  For any private education loan executed after the effective date of
the bill, a lender is prohibited from requiring greater than 12 consecutive,
on-time payments of principal and interest as criteria to apply for cosigner
release.  Under the bill, if a borrower or cosigner requests a change in terms
that restarts the count of consecutive, on-time payments, the lender must
notify the borrower and cosigner in writing, by mail or by electronic mail, of
the impact of the change and provide the borrower or cosigner the right to
withdraw or reverse the request.  The bill provides that a borrower has the
right to request an appeal of a lenders determination to deny a request for
cosigner release, and the lender is required to permit the borrower to submit
certain additional documentation.  The bill requires lenders to establish and
maintain a comprehensive record management system.</span></p>

the private educational lender to accelerate, in whole or in part, payments on
the private education loan, except in cases of payment default.  The bill
prohibits a private education loan executed prior to or after the effective
date of the bill from including a provision that permits a lender to attempt to
collect against the cosigners estate, other than for payment default.  Upon
receiving notification of the death or bankruptcy of a cosigner, when the loan
is not more than 60 days delinquent at the time of the notification, the lender
may not change any terms or benefits under the promissory note, repayment
schedule, repayment terms, or monthly payment amount or any other loan provision.</span></p>

cosigner from his obligations under a private education loan.  Upon
determination of the total and permanent disability of a cosigner, a lender is
required to release that individual cosigner from the obligations of the
cosigner.  The bill requires lenders to notify borrowers and cosigners if a
cosigner or borrower is released from the obligations of the private education
loan, within 30 days of the release.  The bill requires lenders that extend
private education loans to provide the borrower the option to designate an
individual to have the legal authority to act on behalf of the borrower with
respect to the private education loan in the event of the total and permanent
disability of the borrower.  In the event a cosigner is released from the
obligations of a private education loan, a lender may not require the borrower
to obtain another cosigner on the loan obligation.  The bill provides that
lenders may not declare a default or accelerate the debt against the borrower
on the sole basis of the release of the cosigner from the loan obligation.  The
bill requires lenders, upon determination of the total and permanent disability
of a borrower, to discharge the liability of the borrower and cosigner on the
loan.  After making the determination of the total and permanent disability of
a borrower, a lender may not attempt to collect on the outstanding liability of
the borrower or cosigner or monitor the disability status of the borrower after
the date of discharge. </span></p>
