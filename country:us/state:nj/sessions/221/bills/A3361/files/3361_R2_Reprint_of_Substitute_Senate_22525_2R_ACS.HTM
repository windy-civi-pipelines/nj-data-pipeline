Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize a tenant to sublet or assign the tenants interest where otherwise prohibited. c.  A landlord may, notwithstanding subsection a. of this section, establish the initial rate for a new tenancy in which no tenant from the prior tenancy remains in lawful possession of the covered dwelling site. Subsection a. of this section shall only apply to subsequent increases after that initial rate has been established with respect to the new tenancy. d.  Except as allowed following a petition to the commissioner pursuant to subsection g. of this section, if the landlord of a covered dwelling site requests or accepts an increase in rent exceeding the amount permitted pursuant to subsection a. of this section: (1)  the applicable rent for the duration of the present lease or agreement term, or subsequent lease or agreement term if the present term is month-to-month, shall be the rent for the rental term preceding the rent increase in violation of this section; and (2)  the landlord shall be liable for a penalty of $1,000 per violation per unit.  The penalty shall be collected and enforced by summary proceedings pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  The Superior Court, Law Division, Special Civil Part in the county in which the residential rental property is located shall have jurisdiction over the proceedings described pursuant to this paragraph.  Process shall be in the nature of a summons or warrant, and shall issue upon the complaint of the Commissioner of Community Affairs or the Attorney General. e.  This section shall function in addition to, and not in place of, the existing prohibition on unconscionable rent increases pursuant to subsection f. of section 2 of P.L.1974, c.49 (C.2A:18-61.1).  A tenant may assert a violation of this section as a defense to an eviction action as an unconscionable rent increase. f.  (1)  A tenant shall have the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction to terminate a lease or agreement containing a provision in violation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and shall be permitted to recover reasonable attorneys fees or expenses. (2)  A landlord who violates P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall also, at the discretion of the tenant, be subject to a separate cause of action by the tenant in the Superior Court, Law Division, Special Civil Part in the county in which the covered dwelling site is located.  A tenant may recover $500 from the landlord for a first offense, and $1,000 from the landlord for a second and any subsequent offense, in addition to reasonable attorneys fees or expenses. (3) A landlord shall be subject to the penalties set forth in this subsection for each violation against each tenant, which may be brought pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection at the tenants discretion. g. (1)  (a)  A landlord may petition the commissioner to request approval to increase the rent, in an amount specified by the landlord, on a covered dwelling site in excess of three percent: (i) by demonstrating that the present rental income and additional charges from the manufactured home park on which the landlord seeks relief, are insufficient to cover unanticipated increases in the costs of: the abatement of hazardous conditions, taxes, assessments, maintenance to the manufactured home park, utilities, insurance, and management of the manufactured home park; or (ii)  by submitting proof or documentation of capital improvements to the property, which require the increase in rent. (b) In determining whether to grant a landlords petition pursuant to this subsection, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the rent increase is reasonable and not unconscionable.  If the tenant offers evidence sufficient to overcome the rebuttable presumption, the commissioner may, after a hearing, grant the landlord a rent increase sufficient to meet the landlords requirements or needs after consideration of either the proofs or documentation presented, for approval of a petition submitted pursuant to sub-subparagraph (ii) of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, or the proofs presented, the physical condition of the manufactured home park, the landlords profitability with and without the proposed rent increase, the arguments presented by affected tenants, and the relative bargaining position of the parties, for approval of a petition seeking relief pursuant to sub-subparagraph (i) of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.  The commissioner shall schedule a hearing and make a final determination on a petition pursuant to this paragraph within 90 days after the landlord submits the petition to the commissioner.  If the commissioner fails to act within 90 days after the landlord submits the petition, the rent increase on a covered dwelling site shall be deemed approved, provided the rent increase otherwise complies with the provisions of this subsection. (2) A landlord that seeks to file, or files, a petition pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall: (a) prior to filing the petition, post notice of the petition setting forth the basis for the petition in a conspicuous place in and about the manufactured home park; (b) prior to filing the petition, serve each affected tenant personally, or by certified mail, with the petition to be filed with the commissioner; (c) notify each affected tenant personally, or by certified mail, of the hearing date set by the commissioner; and (d) post notice of the hearing in a conspicuous place in the manufactured home park for at least 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing.2 23.  a.  The provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not preempt an ordinance, rule, or regulation, or other law regarding rent control, rent leveling, or rent stabilization adopted by the governing body of a municipality that: (1)  provides a fixed, numerical municipal rent increase limit that is not based upon, in whole or in part, the Consumer Price Index, or other variable criteria; (2)  was adopted in a municipality that provides and utilizes a rent leveling board or similar municipal agency charged with regulating rents; and (3)  provides a rent increase limit on a covered dwelling site that is less than or equal to three percent over the course of a 12-month period, regardless of whether: (a)  a determination, made by a rent leveling board or similar municipal agency charged with regulating rents, authorizes an exemption from the municipal rent increase limit, resulting in a rent increase on a covered dwelling site that is greater than three percent over the course of a 12-month period; or (b)  the municipal rent increase limit permits one or more exceptions, which are not based upon, in whole or in part, the Consumer Price Index or other variable criteria. b.  Except as provided in subsection a. of this section, the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall preempt an ordinance, rule, regulation, or other law regarding rent control, rent leveling, or rent stabilization adopted by the governing body of a municipality that: (1)  provides a rent increase limit on a covered dwelling site that is greater than three percent over the course of a 12-month period; (2)  does not provide a fixed, numerical municipal rent increase limit, and instead is based upon, in whole or in part, the Consumer Price Index, or other variable criteria; or (3)  was adopted in a municipality that does not provide or utilize a rent leveling board or similar municipal agency charged with regulating rents. c.   If an ordinance, rule, regulation, or other law regarding rent control, rent leveling, or rent stabilization adopted by the governing body of a municipality is preempted pursuant to subsection b. of this section due to the failure of the municipality, in which such a municipal law was adopted, to provide or utilize a rent leveling board or similar municipal agency charged with regulating rents pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of this section, P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not preempt the fixed, numerical municipal rent increase limit provided in the ordinance, rule, regulation, or other law regarding rent control, rent leveling, or rent stabilization, but shall otherwise preempt such a municipal law.2 1[3.] 4.1  The commissioner shall, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt rules and regulations as necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 1[4.] 5.1  This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment, except that the commissioner may take anticipatory action necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  This act shall apply to tenancies commencing on or after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).
