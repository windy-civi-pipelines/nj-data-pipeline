<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Urgent care facility means a
health care facility that offers episodic, walk-in care for the treatment of
acute, but not life-threatening, health conditions.</p>

facilities shall be made available on the departments Internet website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The operational

authorized to make health care decisions on behalf of the patient, forward a
copy of the patients treatment record to the patients primary care provider.
Records forwarded to the patients primary care provider may be transmitted in
any form that can be accessed by the primary care provider, including, but not
limited to, mail, facsimile, electronic mail, or an electronic health records
system. Records forwarded to a primary care provider shall be transmitted no
later than five days after the date the request is made or the date the results
of any testing performed as part of the provision of health care services to
the patient become available, whichever is later.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A retail health clinic
or urgent care facility shall, upon request by the patient or a person
authorized to make health care decisions on behalf of the patient, make a copy
of the patients treatment record available to the patient no later than 24
hours after the request is made.  If the treating professional states, in
writing, that providing the patient with a copy of the record is not medically
advisable, the record shall be provided to a person authorized to make health
care decisions on behalf of the patient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   A retail health clinic
or urgent care facility shall not charge a fee for furnishing or forwarding
copies of patient treatment records that exceed the actual costs incurred by
the clinic or facility in furnishing or forwarding the record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Each patient who
receives health care services at a retail health clinic or urgent care facility
shall be urged by the treating professional to follow up with the patients
primary care provider.  If the patient does not have a primary care provider,

individuals currently enrolled in the Medicaid or NJ FamilyCare programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The operational
supervisor of each retail health clinic and urgent care facility shall insure
that a written summary of the rights set forth in section 2 of this act be
given to the patient or to the person authorized to make health care decisions
on behalf of the patient prior to the provision of health care services, and
that a written notice listing these rights is posted in a conspicuous place in
the clinic or facility.</p>

health care services at a retail health clinic or urgent care facility shall
have the right:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     To considerate and
respectful care consistent with sound nursing and medical practices, which

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes an
annual registration requirement and certain operational requirements for retail
health clinics and urgent care facilities.  Retail health clinics are health
care facilities that are located within a retail store, supermarket, pharmacy,
or similar retail outlet that offer walk-in services limited to preventative
and wellness care, vaccine administration, and related services.  Urgent care
facilities are health care facilities that offer episodic, walk-in care for the
treatment of acute, but not life-threatening, health conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each retail health clinic and
urgent care facility that is not otherwise licensed as an ambulatory care
facility will be required to register with the Department of Health on an
annual basis.  The clinic or facility will be required to submit with its
annual registration information concerning: its location and hours of
operation; the names of its medical supervisor, operational supervisor, and
chief customer service officer; the names of any health care professionals
employed by or affiliated with the clinic or facility; the nature and scope of
health care services provided and conditions treated at the clinic or facility;
and any other information as may be required by the department.  Registry
information for retail health clinics and urgent care facilities will be made
available on the departments Internet website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The operational supervisor of
each clinic or facility will be responsible for ensuring the clinic or facility
is compliant with all State and federal requirements regarding patient privacy
and the confidentiality of patient information, medical records, proper
credentialing of affiliated health care professionals, vaccine reporting
requirements, and prohibitions against self-interested referrals and patient
steering practices.  The medical supervisor of each clinic or facility is responsible
for overseeing all health care services provided at a retail health clinic or
urgent care facility.  A person may simultaneously serve as operational
supervisor and medical supervisor at a retail health clinic or urgent care
facility, provided the person does not have a supervisory role at more than
three retail health clinics or urgent care facilities.  Each retail health
clinic and urgent care facility is to have a chief customer service officer,
who will serve as the point of contact for consumer complaints, appeals, and
inquiries.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Retail health clinics and
urgent care facilities will be required to make the patients treatment record
available to the patient upon request, and to furnish a copy to the patients
primary care provider upon request.  Records are to be forwarded to the
patients primary care provider no later than five days after the request is
made or any related testing is completed, whichever is later, and may be
transmitted in any form that can be accessed by the primary care provider. The
fees charged for furnishing or forwarding copies of the patients treatment
record are not to exceed the actual costs of providing the records.  If the
treating professional indicates in writing that it is not medically advisable
to provide a copy of the medical record to the patient, the record will be
provided to a person authorized to make health care decisions on the patients
behalf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Patients receiving health care
services at a retail health clinic or urgent care facility are to be urged by
the treating professional to follow up with the patients primary care
provider.  If the patient does not have a primary care provider, the retail
health clinic or urgent care facility will be required to offer to assist the
patient in locating a primary care provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Except in emergent
circumstances, retail health clinics and urgent care facilities will be
prohibited from providing health care services to individuals younger than 18
years of age or to individuals currently enrolled in the Medicaid or NJ
FamilyCare programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes an
enumerated list of patient rights.  The operational supervisor of each retail
health clinic and urgent care facility will be required to insure that a
written summary of these rights is given to the patient or the person
authorized to make health care decisions on behalf of the patient prior to the
provision of health care services, and that a written notice listing these
rights is posted in a conspicuous place in the clinic or facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner will be
permitted to adopt rules and regulations concerning retail health clinics and
urgent care facilities, including requirements regarding the nature, scope, and
specific health care services that may be provided at retail health clinics and
urgent care facilities, as well as any additional standards and requirements
for the operation of retail health clinics and urgent care facilities as may be
appropriate. </p>
