(2)   Each mobile telecommunications company and telephone exchange company shall be liable for the fee imposed, collected, or required to be paid, collected, or remitted under the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection a. of this section.

The director and the board may adopt regulations necessary to administer the credit. (cf: P.L.2007, c.102, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect on July 1st following enactment.
