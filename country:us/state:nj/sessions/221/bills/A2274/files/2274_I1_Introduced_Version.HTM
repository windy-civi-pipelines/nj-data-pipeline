(cf: P.L.1977, c.419, s.6) 6. (New section)  a.  Any association of a planned real estate development shall undertake and fund a capital reserve study which shall determine or assess the adequacy of the associations capital reserve funds to meet the anticipated costs of replacement or repair of the capital assets of a common interest community that the association is obligated to maintain.  All capital reserve studies shall be prepared in conformity with the latest edition of the National Reserve Study Standards of the Community Associations Institute or similar standards by another recognized national organization.  A capital reserve study conducted pursuant to this section shall be performed or overseen by a reserve specialist who is credentialed through the Community Associations Institute or an engineer or architect who is licensed by the State and shall include, but be not limited to, the following: (1)  the associations capital reserve fund balances; (2)  the associations anticipated income and expenses; (3)  an analysis of the physical status and of the common area components of the buildings and other common areas that the association is obligated to maintain; (4)  the anticipated costs associated with the building maintenance, as well as the anticipated costs of repair or replacement of common area building components, which are necessary to maintain the structural integrity of the buildings and other common area components that the association is obligated to maintain; (5)  a reasonable estimate of the cost of: (a) future reserve studies; (b) reserve study updates; and (c) periodic structural inspections required pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill; (6)  a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with implementing any corrective maintenance deemed necessary pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (7)  a proposed 30-year funding plan, as described in section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) that establishes the adequate proposed capital reserve funding over a 30-year time period; and (8)  any other information necessary to perform an analysis of the adequacy of the associations capital reserve funds relative to maintaining the structural integrity of buildings and common areas which the association is obligated to maintain. b.   Associations which have not undertaken a reserve study within five years of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall undertake a reserve study within one year of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). Associations formed after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall undertake a reserve study as soon as practicable after the election of a majority of an executive board pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1983, c.30 (C.45:22A-47), but in no event shall such study be undertaken more than two years following the election of a majority of the executive board under section 5 of P.L.1983, c.30 (C.45:22A-47). c.   A covered building owner, as defined in section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall ensure that a capital reserve study conducted pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by a licensed architect, engineer, or credentialed reserve specialist, and that a capital reserve study be conducted and reviewed at least once every five years. d.   This section shall not apply to an association of a planned real estate development with less than $25,000 in total common area capital assets. 7. (New section)  a.  An association of a planned real estate development shall obtain a reserve study including a 30-year funding plan in order to ensure that the association has adequate reserve funds available to repair or replace the capital assets located on the common elements and facilities that the association is obligated to maintain without need to create a special assessment or loan obligation, except that in those cases in which a capital asset reaches the end of its established useful life earlier than predicted by the reserve study, nothing herein is intended to prevent the imposition of a special assessment or obtaining a loan.  These reserve funds shall be used for the repair or replacement of components that have reached the end of their established useful life as set forth in the most recent reserve study undertaken pursuant to section 6 of P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.   When an expenditure of the reserve funds is required to repair or replace a component pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the association shall use only the amount of reserve funds allocated by the reserve study to make such repair or replacement, unless: (1)  the use of such additional funds from the reserve fund is not reasonably anticipated to prevent or interfere with the ability of the association to undertake additional repairs or replacements in the five years subsequent to the additional expenditure; and (2)  the associations executive board adopts a written resolution requiring that the expenditure of these additional funds shall be recovered within the following five fiscal years. c.   If an association existing as of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) does not have an adequate reserve fund as described in subsection a. of this section, and the increase in the associations budget line item for reserve funding to render it adequate as set forth in the reserve study would, without reference to any other budget line item adjustments, require an increase of more than 10 percent of the previous years common expense assessment, the deficiency shall be made adequate within the earlier of the following 10 fiscal years, or the projected date predicted by the reserve study by which absent increased funding, the balance in the associations reserve account would fall below zero.  In either case, the annual increase in reserve funding during the required period of time shall be an equal annual line item increase in the reserve fund until the reserve fund is made adequate, notwithstanding causing an increase of more than 10 percent in the annual common expense assessment. d.   If an association existing as of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) does not have an adequate reserve fund as described in subsection a. of this section, and the increase in the associations budget line item for reserve funding to render it in conformity with the reserve study would, without reference to any other item adjustments, require an increase of less than 10 percent of the previous years common expense assessment, the deficiency shall be made adequate within the following two fiscal years. 8. (New section)  a.  Notwithstanding the terms of a declaration, master deed, bylaws, or other governing document of an association, the executive board may, without the consent of the owners or approval of a developer selling units in the planned real estate development, adopt an assessment payable by the owners over one or more fiscal years or obtain a loan on such terms as the board determines are reasonable, whenever necessary to fund the cost of corrective maintenance of the primary load bearing system of the planned real estate development pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Prior to adopting an assessment or obtaining a loan under this section, the executive board shall make a determination that the assessment or loan are necessary to maintain structural integrity of a building and shall obtain a written report from an engineer or architect licensed by the State that states that the failure to undertake corrective maintenance of the primary load bearing system will: (1) constitute an imminent or reasonably foreseeable hazard to health or safety; (2) constitute a violation of section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or (3) will result in a material increase in the cost of such corrective maintenance if delayed. b. Nothing in this section shall prevent or interfere with the right of an association to pursue a lawsuit concerning claims for construction defects related to any common element of the planned real estate development. 9. (New section)  The developer shall prepare a document which sets forth the preventative maintenance tasks to be undertaken by the association over the life of the common area components.  This preventive maintenance document shall provide the maintenance schedule and timing for preventive maintenance, including, but not limited to, periodic inspections of the structural components of the buildings or common areas which the association is obligated to maintain.  The developer shall include within the budget prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-35) all operating expenses associated with the preventative maintenance set forth in the preventative maintenance document prepared pursuant to this section.  The preventative maintenance document shall be updated at the completion of any structural inspections performed pursuant to P.L.   , c.   (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) in order to reflect and address any required corrective maintenance. 10. (New section)  Within 60 days after the conveyance of 75 percent of the lots, parcels, units or interests, the developer shall relinquish control of the association, and the unit owners shall accept control, as required by section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47).  At that time, the developer shall also deliver to the association all property of the unit owners and of the association held or controlled by the developer, including, but not limited to, the following items, if applicable, as to each lot, parcel, unit or interest operated by the association: a. A photocopy of the recorded master deed or declaration and all amendments thereto, certified by affidavit of the developer, or an officer or agent of the developer, as being a complete copy of the actual master deed. b. A certified copy of the association's articles of incorporation, or if not incorporated, then copies of the documents creating the association. c. A copy of the bylaws and all amendments thereto, certified by affidavit of the developer, or an officer or agent of the developer, as being a complete copy of the bylaws. d. A preventative maintenance document or manual created by the developer pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) which sets forth a schedule for monitoring on a periodic basis the structural integrity of the buildings primary load bearing system. e. The minute books, including all minutes, and other books and records of the association, if any. f. Any house rules and regulations which have been promulgated. g. Resignations of officers and members of the governing board or other form of administration who are required to resign because the developer is required to relinquish control of the association. h. An accounting for all association funds, including capital accounts and contributions as of the date of the election of a majority of the executive board members. i. Association funds or control thereof. j. All tangible personal property that is property of the association, represented by the developer to be part of the common elements or ostensibly part of the common elements, and an inventory of that property. k. A copy of the plans and specifications utilized in the construction or remodeling of improvements and the supplying of equipment to the planned real estate development, including plans setting forth all field changes impacting any component of the primary load bearing system and in the construction and installation of all mechanical components serving the improvements and the site, with a certificate in affidavit form of the developer, his agent, or an architect or engineer authorized to practice in this State that such plans and specifications represent, to the best of their knowledge and belief, the actual plans and specifications utilized in the construction and improvement of the condominium property and for the construction and installation of the mechanical components serving the improvements. l. Insurance policies. m. Copies of any certificates of occupancy which may have been issued for the planned real estate development property. n. Any other permits issued by governmental bodies applicable to the planned real estate development property in force or issued within one year prior to the date the unit owners other than the developer take control of the association. o. All written warranties of the contractor, subcontractors, suppliers, and manufacturers, if any, that are still effective. p. A roster of unit owners and their addresses and telephone numbers, if known, as shown on the developer's records. q. Leases of the common elements and other leases to which the association is a party. r. Employment contracts, management contracts, maintenance contracts, contracts for the supply of equipment or materials, and service contracts in which the association is one of the contracting parties and maintenance contracts and service contracts in which the association or the unit owners have an obligation or responsibility, directly or indirectly, to pay some or all of the fee or charge of the person or persons performing the service. s. All other contracts to which the association is a party. 11.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill supplements the State Uniform Construction Code Act (UCCA) to require that certain covered buildings, which are limited to condominiums and cooperatives, and plans be inspected and reviewed by a structural inspector, as defined in the bill, at certain times and intervals. In addition, this bill assures that planned real estate developments have adequate reserve funds to make certain required maintenance repairs to building components and common areas. Under the bill, following the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, an initial structural inspection of the building components forming the primary load bearing system of a covered building is required to be completed by a post-occupancy structural inspector.  The bill further establishes certain timelines for inspections, dependent on when a certificate of occupancy was issued. In addition, this bill requires that a planned real estate development undertake a capital reserve study to identify and assess the adequacy of the associations capital reserve funds to meet the anticipated costs associated with maintaining the structural integrity of the buildings that the association is obligated to maintain.  This capital reserve study is to be conducted by a credentialed reserve specialist, or licensed engineer or architect, and is to include an analysis of certain provisions enumerated in the bill. In addition, this bill requires that a planned real estate development create and fund a plan to ensure that adequate reserve funds are available to repair or replace one or more components of common elements and facilities that the association is obligated to maintain without need to create a special assessment or loan obligation.  The bill also allows a planned real estate developments executive board to adopt an assessment payable by the owners over one or more fiscal years, or obtain a loan on terms as the board determines to be reasonable, when necessary to fund the cost of corrective maintenance of the primary load bearing system of the planned real estate development.  Prior to adopting the assessment, the board is to be required to obtain a written report from a licensed engineer or architect explaining that the failure to undertake corrective maintenance of the primary load bearing system would produce certain results enumerated in the bill. The bill requires that the developer of a planned real estate development prepare a document setting forth a schedule for the preventative maintenance tasks to be undertaken by the association over the life of the common area components, including, but not limited to, periodic inspections of the structural components of the buildings or common areas that the association is obligated to maintain.  This document is also to be made available to prospective purchasers or owners of units, parcels, or other interests of the planned real estate development.  This preventative maintenance document is to also be updated pursuant to the specifications of any structural inspections or reports performed under the UCCA.

(cf: P.L.1977, c.419, s.6) 6. (New section)  a.  Any association of a planned real estate development shall undertake and fund a capital reserve study which shall determine or assess the adequacy of the associations capital reserve funds to meet the anticipated costs of replacement or repair of the capital assets of a common interest community that the association is obligated to maintain.  All capital reserve studies shall be prepared in conformity with the latest edition of the National Reserve Study Standards of the Community Associations Institute or similar standards by another recognized national organization.  A capital reserve study conducted pursuant to this section shall be performed or overseen by a reserve specialist who is credentialed through the Community Associations Institute or an engineer or architect who is licensed by the State and shall include, but be not limited to, the following: (1)  the associations capital reserve fund balances; (2)  the associations anticipated income and expenses; (3)  an analysis of the physical status and of the common area components of the buildings and other common areas that the association is obligated to maintain; (4)  the anticipated costs associated with the building maintenance, as well as the anticipated costs of repair or replacement of common area building components, which are necessary to maintain the structural integrity of the buildings and other common area components that the association is obligated to maintain; (5)  a reasonable estimate of the cost of: (a) future reserve studies; (b) reserve study updates; and (c) periodic structural inspections required pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill; (6)  a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with implementing any corrective maintenance deemed necessary pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (7)  a proposed 30-year funding plan, as described in section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) that establishes the adequate proposed capital reserve funding over a 30-year time period; and (8)  any other information necessary to perform an analysis of the adequacy of the associations capital reserve funds relative to maintaining the structural integrity of buildings and common areas which the association is obligated to maintain. b.   Associations which have not undertaken a reserve study within five years of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall undertake a reserve study within one year of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). Associations formed after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall undertake a reserve study as soon as practicable after the election of a majority of an executive board pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1983, c.30 (C.45:22A-47), but in no event shall such study be undertaken more than two years following the election of a majority of the executive board under section 5 of P.L.1983, c.30 (C.45:22A-47). c.   A covered building owner, as defined in section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall ensure that a capital reserve study conducted pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by a licensed architect, engineer, or credentialed reserve specialist, and that a capital reserve study be conducted and reviewed at least once every five years. d.   This section shall not apply to an association of a planned real estate development with less than $25,000 in total common area capital assets. 7. (New section)  a.  An association of a planned real estate development shall obtain a reserve study including a 30-year funding plan in order to ensure that the association has adequate reserve funds available to repair or replace the capital assets located on the common elements and facilities that the association is obligated to maintain without need to create a special assessment or loan obligation, except that in those cases in which a capital asset reaches the end of its established useful life earlier than predicted by the reserve study, nothing herein is intended to prevent the imposition of a special assessment or obtaining a loan.  These reserve funds shall be used for the repair or replacement of components that have reached the end of their established useful life as set forth in the most recent reserve study undertaken pursuant to section 6 of P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.   When an expenditure of the reserve funds is required to repair or replace a component pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the association shall use only the amount of reserve funds allocated by the reserve study to make such repair or replacement, unless: (1)  the use of such additional funds from the reserve fund is not reasonably anticipated to prevent or interfere with the ability of the association to undertake additional repairs or replacements in the five years subsequent to the additional expenditure; and (2)  the associations executive board adopts a written resolution requiring that the expenditure of these additional funds shall be recovered within the following five fiscal years. c.   If an association existing as of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) does not have an adequate reserve fund as described in subsection a. of this section, and the increase in the associations budget line item for reserve funding to render it adequate as set forth in the reserve study would, without reference to any other budget line item adjustments, require an increase of more than 10 percent of the previous years common expense assessment, the deficiency shall be made adequate within the earlier of the following 10 fiscal years, or the projected date predicted by the reserve study by which absent increased funding, the balance in the associations reserve account would fall below zero.  In either case, the annual increase in reserve funding during the required period of time shall be an equal annual line item increase in the reserve fund until the reserve fund is made adequate, notwithstanding causing an increase of more than 10 percent in the annual common expense assessment. d.   If an association existing as of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) does not have an adequate reserve fund as described in subsection a. of this section, and the increase in the associations budget line item for reserve funding to render it in conformity with the reserve study would, without reference to any other item adjustments, require an increase of less than 10 percent of the previous years common expense assessment, the deficiency shall be made adequate within the following two fiscal years. 8. (New section)  a.  Notwithstanding the terms of a declaration, master deed, bylaws, or other governing document of an association, the executive board may, without the consent of the owners or approval of a developer selling units in the planned real estate development, adopt an assessment payable by the owners over one or more fiscal years or obtain a loan on such terms as the board determines are reasonable, whenever necessary to fund the cost of corrective maintenance of the primary load bearing system of the planned real estate development pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Prior to adopting an assessment or obtaining a loan under this section, the executive board shall make a determination that the assessment or loan are necessary to maintain structural integrity of a building and shall obtain a written report from an engineer or architect licensed by the State that states that the failure to undertake corrective maintenance of the primary load bearing system will: (1) constitute an imminent or reasonably foreseeable hazard to health or safety; (2) constitute a violation of section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or (3) will result in a material increase in the cost of such corrective maintenance if delayed. b. Nothing in this section shall prevent or interfere with the right of an association to pursue a lawsuit concerning claims for construction defects related to any common element of the planned real estate development. 9. (New section)  The developer shall prepare a document which sets forth the preventative maintenance tasks to be undertaken by the association over the life of the common area components.  This preventive maintenance document shall provide the maintenance schedule and timing for preventive maintenance, including, but not limited to, periodic inspections of the structural components of the buildings or common areas which the association is obligated to maintain.  The developer shall include within the budget prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-35) all operating expenses associated with the preventative maintenance set forth in the preventative maintenance document prepared pursuant to this section.  The preventative maintenance document shall be updated at the completion of any structural inspections performed pursuant to P.L.   , c.   (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) in order to reflect and address any required corrective maintenance. 10. (New section)  Within 60 days after the conveyance of 75 percent of the lots, parcels, units or interests, the developer shall relinquish control of the association, and the unit owners shall accept control, as required by section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47).  At that time, the developer shall also deliver to the association all property of the unit owners and of the association held or controlled by the developer, including, but not limited to, the following items, if applicable, as to each lot, parcel, unit or interest operated by the association: a. A photocopy of the recorded master deed or declaration and all amendments thereto, certified by affidavit of the developer, or an officer or agent of the developer, as being a complete copy of the actual master deed. b. A certified copy of the association's articles of incorporation, or if not incorporated, then copies of the documents creating the association. c. A copy of the bylaws and all amendments thereto, certified by affidavit of the developer, or an officer or agent of the developer, as being a complete copy of the bylaws. d. A preventative maintenance document or manual created by the developer pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) which sets forth a schedule for monitoring on a periodic basis the structural integrity of the buildings primary load bearing system. e. The minute books, including all minutes, and other books and records of the association, if any. f. Any house rules and regulations which have been promulgated. g. Resignations of officers and members of the governing board or other form of administration who are required to resign because the developer is required to relinquish control of the association. h.

Association funds or control thereof. j. All tangible personal property that is property of the association, represented by the developer to be part of the common elements or ostensibly part of the common elements, and an inventory of that property. k. A copy of the plans and specifications utilized in the construction or remodeling of improvements and the supplying of equipment to the planned real estate development, including plans setting forth all field changes impacting any component of the primary load bearing system and in the construction and installation of all mechanical components serving the improvements and the site, with a certificate in affidavit form of the developer, his agent, or an architect or engineer authorized to practice in this State that such plans and specifications represent, to the best of their knowledge and belief, the actual plans and specifications utilized in the construction and improvement of the condominium property and for the construction and installation of the mechanical components serving the improvements. l. Insurance policies. m. Copies of any certificates of occupancy which may have been issued for the planned real estate development property. n. Any other permits issued by governmental bodies applicable to the planned real estate development property in force or issued within one year prior to the date the unit owners other than the developer take control of the association. o.

STATEMENT This bill supplements the State Uniform Construction Code Act (UCCA) to require that certain covered buildings, which are limited to condominiums and cooperatives, and plans be inspected and reviewed by a structural inspector, as defined in the bill, at certain times and intervals. In addition, this bill assures that planned real estate developments have adequate reserve funds to make certain required maintenance repairs to building components and common areas. Under the bill, following the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, an initial structural inspection of the building components forming the primary load bearing system of a covered building is required to be completed by a post-occupancy structural inspector.  The bill further establishes certain timelines for inspections, dependent on when a certificate of occupancy was issued. In addition, this bill requires that a planned real estate development undertake a capital reserve study to identify and assess the adequacy of the associations capital reserve funds to meet the anticipated costs associated with maintaining the structural integrity of the buildings that the association is obligated to maintain.  This capital reserve study is to be conducted by a credentialed reserve specialist, or licensed engineer or architect, and is to include an analysis of certain provisions enumerated in the bill. In addition, this bill requires that a planned real estate development create and fund a plan to ensure that adequate reserve funds are available to repair or replace one or more components of common elements and facilities that the association is obligated to maintain without need to create a special assessment or loan obligation.  The bill also allows a planned real estate developments executive board to adopt an assessment payable by the owners over one or more fiscal years, or obtain a loan on terms as the board determines to be reasonable, when necessary to fund the cost of corrective maintenance of the primary load bearing system of the planned real estate development.  Prior to adopting the assessment, the board is to be required to obtain a written report from a licensed engineer or architect explaining that the failure to undertake corrective maintenance of the primary load bearing system would produce certain results enumerated in the bill. The bill requires that the developer of a planned real estate development prepare a document setting forth a schedule for the preventative maintenance tasks to be undertaken by the association over the life of the common area components, including, but not limited to, periodic inspections of the structural components of the buildings or common areas that the association is obligated to maintain.  This document is also to be made available to prospective purchasers or owners of units, parcels, or other interests of the planned real estate development.  This preventative maintenance document is to also be updated pursuant to the specifications of any structural inspections or reports performed under the UCCA.
