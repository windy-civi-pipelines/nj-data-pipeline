(cf: P.L.2018, c.50, s.4) 3.    Section 5 of P.L.1990, c.39 (C.54:40B-5) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a.  Every distributor or wholesaler required to pay the tax imposed by this act shall be personally liable for the tax imposed under this act. b.    If a distributor or wholesaler fails to pay the tax imposed by this act when required to pay the same, then in addition to all other rights, obligations and remedies provided, the compensating use tax imposed in subsection c. of section 3 of P.L.1990, c.39 (C.54:40B-3) and section 3 of P.L.2006, c.37 (C.54:40B-3.1) shall be payable by the retail dealer or consumer directly to the director, and it shall be the duty of the retail dealer or consumer to file a return, on a form prescribed by the director, with the director and to pay the tax to the director within 20 days of the date the tax was required to be paid or at other times as specified by the director. (cf: P.L.2001, c.448, s.4) 4.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the second month after enactment and apply to the sale, use, or distribution of cigars on and after that date. STATEMENT This bill limits the taxation of cigars under the Tobacco and Vapor Products Tax Act to a maximum of 50 cents per cigar.  Currently, the tax on cigars is 30 percent of the wholesale price. Under this bill, the tax will still be 30 percent of the wholesale price, but the tax will be capped at 50 cents per cigar. The bill also amends current law to clarify tax payment responsibilities of tobacco product wholesalers and distributors. Every state imposes some tax on non-cigarette tobacco products.  Ten states have adopted a tax cap per cigar.  Cigar retailers with establishments in those states have claimed that prior to the establishment of the cap their retail sales prices suffered a serious competitive disadvantage with out-of-state, Internet, and catalog businesses that did not collect state tobacco products tax. Setting a maximum tax per cigar is proposed to encourage New Jersey consumers to make more of their cigar purchases from New Jersey brick and mortar retailers who are often small locally-owned businesses.  A 50 cent per cigar tax cap will level the playing field for New Jersey retailers and potentially increase State revenues collected under the tax.
