<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This omnibus bill addresses riot
and certain violent crime committed during the course of riot.  Presently, a
person is guilty of riot if he participates with four or more others in a
course of disorderly conduct with an unlawful purpose, enumerated in the
statute.  This bill amends subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:33-1, riot, and expands
the categories of riot to include aggravated riot, inciting a riot and
aggravated inciting a riot.  Under the bill, a person commits riot if the he
participates in a violent public disturbance involving an assembly of three or
more persons, acting with a common intent to assist each other in violent and
disorderly conduct, resulting in (1) Injury to another person; (2) Damage to
property; or (3) Imminent danger of injury to another person or damage to
property.  A person who commits a riot when he or any other participant, known
to him, uses or plans to use a firearm or other deadly weapon is guilty of a
crime of the third degree.  A crime of the third degree is punishable by up to
5 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both. Otherwise riot is a
crime of the fourth degree.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by up
to 18 months imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     New subsection b. is added to
N.J.S.2C:33-1 to provide a person commits aggravated riot if, in the course of
committing a riot, he: (1) Participates with 25 or more other persons; (2)
Causes serious bodily injury to a person not participating in the riot; (3)
Causes property damage in excess of $5,000; (4) Displays, uses, threatens to
use, or attempts to use a deadly weapon; or (5) By force, or threat of force,
endangers the safe movement of a vehicle traveling on a public street, highway,
or road.  A person who commits aggravating riot commits a crime of the second
degree. A crime of the second degree is punishable by up to 10 years
imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     New subsection c. is added to
N.J.S.2C:33-1 to provide a person commits inciting a riot if he willfully
incites another person to participate in a riot, resulting in a riot or
imminent danger of a riot. A person who commits inciting a riot commits a crime
of the third degree.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     New subsection d. is added to
N.J.S.2C:33-1 to provide a person commits aggravated inciting a riot if he (1)
Incites a riot resulting in serious bodily harm to another person not
participating in the riot; (2) Incites a riot resulting in property damage in
excess of $5,000; or (3) Supplies a deadly weapon to another person or teaches
another person to prepare a deadly weapon with intent that the deadly weapon be
used in a riot for an unlawful purpose.  A person who commits aggravated
inciting a riot commits a crime of the second degree.</p>

arrested for a violation of N.J.S.2C:33-1 shall be held in custody until
brought before the court for a pretrial detention hearing.  The bill does not
prohibit constitutionally protected activity such as a peaceful protest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends N.J.S.2C:33-7,
obstructing highways or other passages, to provide that it shall be unlawful
for a person, having no legal privilege to do so, to purposely or recklessly
obstruct any highway or other public passage whether alone or with others.  No
person shall be deemed in violation of this subsection solely because of a
gathering of persons to hear him speak or otherwise communicate, or solely
because of being a member of such a gathering.  The amendment leaves intact
subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:33-7, which concerns refusal to obey a reasonable
official request or order to move.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends N.J.S.2C:12-1,
Assault.  Currently, paragraph (5) of subsection b. enumerates specific
circumstances when aggravated assault occurs.  This bill adds that a person is
guilty of aggravated assault if he attempts to cause or purposely, knowingly or
recklessly causes bodily injury to another in the course of a riot.  Aggravated
assault under this circumstance is a crime of the third degree, punishable by
up to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Paragraph (5) of subsection b.
of N.J.S.2C:12-1 further elevates simple assault to aggravated assault when
committed against certain categories of persons, including when committed
against a law enforcement officer acting in the performance of the officers
duties while in uniform or exhibiting evidence of authority or because of the
officers status as a law enforcement officer, and is graded as a crime of the
third degree.  Under the bill, if, in the course of a riot, an object is thrown
at certain emergency personnel including law enforcement officers, or if the
emergency personnel is struck, whether or not with an object, the presumption
of non-imprisonment for a first offense of a crime of the third degree shall

provision, a person is guilty of criminal mischief if he, without the consent
of the owner thereof, willfully and maliciously defaces, injures, or otherwise
damages by any means a memorial or historic property, and the value of the
damage to the memorial or historic property is greater than $200.  The bill
grades this offense as a crime of the third degree where the damage is to a
memorial or historic property.  The bill provides that historic property
means any building, structure, site, or object that has been officially
designated or approved for inclusion, or which meets the criteria for

historic site, or historic object through a federal, state, or local
designation program.  Memorial means a plaque, statue, marker, flag, banner,
cenotaph, religious symbol, painting, seal, tombstone, structure name, or
display that is constructed and located with the intent of being permanently
displayed or perpetually maintained; is dedicated to a historical person, an

service of any past or present United States Armed Forces military personnel,
or the past or present public service of a resident of the geographical area
comprising the state or the United States.  A court shall order any person
convicted of violating this provision to pay restitution, which shall include
the full cost of repair or replacement of such memorial or historic property.</p>

facilitated by conditions arising from the riot.  The section is further
amended to provide that conditions arising from the riot, means civil unrest,
power outages, curfews, or a reduction in the presence of or response time for
first responders or homeland security personnel.  A person arrested for
committing a burglary during a riot or aggravated riot may not be released until

riot prohibited under section N.J.S.2C:33-1 and the perpetration of the theft
is facilitated by conditions arising from the riot; the theft is committed
after the declaration of emergency is made, and the perpetration of the theft
is facilitated by conditions arising from the emergency, the theft is a crime
of the second degree.  Under the bill, the term conditions arising from the
riot means civil unrest, power outages, curfews, or a reduction in the
presence of or response time for first responders or homeland security
personnel and the term conditions arising from the emergency means civil
unrest, power outages, curfews, voluntary or mandatory evacuations, or a
reduction in the presence of or response time for first responders or homeland
