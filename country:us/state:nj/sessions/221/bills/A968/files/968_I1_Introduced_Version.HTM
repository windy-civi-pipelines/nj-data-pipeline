<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill allows a
municipality to challenge an order by the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH)
to construct, or allow to be constructed, a non-redevelopment housing project
on undeveloped land.  The municipal challenge would be successful, unless the
order by COAH is based on exclusionary zoning practices occurring in the
municipality at the time the order is made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, this bill caps
the number of units a municipality may have allocated as its fair share
affordable housing obligation with regard to the size of the municipal
population.  Current law provides that no municipality shall be required to
address a fair share of affordable housing units beyond 1,000 low and moderate
income units within 10 years from the grant of substantive certification;
except that a municipality may be allocated more than 1,000 units if, based
upon an evidentiary hearing, it is found likely that the municipality, through
its zoning powers, could create a realistic opportunity for more than 1,000 low
and moderate income units within that 10-year period.  For some municipalities
in the State, this many additional units may increase the overall municipal
population dramatically.  In order to prevent the disparate impact this can
create for municipalities with small populations, this bill provides that an
allocation of units to a municipality as its fair share shall not exceed an
amount that would result in an increase of the municipal population by more
than five percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, this bill requires
the exclusion of flood-prone land when computing a municipal adjustment of
available land resources as part of the determination of a municipality's fair
share affordable housing obligation.  Currently, land may not be considered in
determining a municipalitys available land resources for affordable housing
purposes if it contains any one of various special features, consisting of: (a)
land owned by a government entity, and intended for a public purpose, (b)
certain park land, open space and other land dedicated for conservation, (c)
certain very small land parcels held in private ownership, (d) historic and
architecturally important sites, (e) agricultural land with restricted
development rights, (f) sites designated for active recreation, and (g)
environmentally sensitive land where development is prohibited by law.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would also exclude
from determinations of available land resources for affordable housing purposes
any land that is (1) lower than the most recent flood elevation determination,
measured under federal standards, (2) lower than the applicable flood elevation
standard required under regulations adopted pursuant to the &quot;Flood Hazard
Area Control Act,&quot; P.L.1962, c.19 (C.58:16A-50 et seq.), or (3) within 100
feet of category one waters, as designated by the Department of Environmental
Protection.  As defined under 44 C.F.R.59.1, a flood elevation determination
refers to a determination by the Federal Insurance Administrator of the water
surface elevations of a base flood, also understood as a flood level that has
a one percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill directs the
Department of Environmental Protection to adopt rules and regulations to guide
determinations of flood-prone lands by the first day of the seventh month next
following enactment.  This bill remains inoperative until the first day of the
