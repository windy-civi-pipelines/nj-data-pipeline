(cf: P.L.2008, c.31, s.2) 4.   Section 4 of P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-8) is amended to read as follows: 4.   a.  The proceeds of the fees collected by the county recording officer, as authorized by P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-5 et seq.), shall be accounted for and remitted to the county treasurer. b.   (1)  The county portion of the basic fee collected pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-7) shall be retained by the county treasurer for the use of the county.

(2)   In addition to the amounts credited to the "Shore Protection Fund" pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, amounts equal to $12,000,000 in each of the first 10 years after the date of enactment of the "Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act," P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.) and to $5,000,000 in each year thereafter, paid during the State fiscal year to the State Treasurer from the payment of [fees collected by the county recording officer other than the additional fee of $0.75 for each $500.00 of consideration or fractional part thereof recited in the deed in excess of $150,000.00] the State portion of the basic fee shall be credited to the "Highlands Protection Fund" created pursuant to section 21 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-19), in the manner established under that section.  No monies shall be credited to the "Highlands Protection Fund" pursuant to this paragraph until and unless the full amount of $25,000,000 has first been credited to the "Shore Protection Fund" pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. d.    All amounts paid to the State Treasurer from the payment of the additional fee  shall be credited to the Neighborhood Preservation Nonlapsing Revolving Fund established pursuant to P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), in the manner established under section 20 thereof (C.52:27D-320). (cf: P.L.2004, c.120, s.61) 5.    The following sections are repealed: Section 2 of P.L.2003, c.113 (C.46:15-7.1); Section 8 of P.L.2004, c.66 (C.46:15-7.2); and Section 2 of P.L.2005, c.19 (C.46:15-7.3). 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill eliminates three recently enacted realty transfer fees: the supplemental fee created in 2003 and the general purpose fee and mansion fee created 2004.  The supplemental fee applies to sellers and consists of a graduated fee, applicable to non-exempt property sales generally.  The general purpose fee applies to a seller and consists of a graduated fee, applicable to non-exempt real property exceeding $350,000.  The mansion fee consists of 1% of the purchase price and applies to buyers of residential property exceeding $1,000,000. The three fees substantially increase cost of buying and selling real property for New Jerseyans.  As an example, the total transfer fee costs of selling a $750,000 home is now $6,775.  This amount is almost double the $3,525 cost from fiscal year 2003. These realty transfer fees are actually taxes, as they add to the cost of a transaction to increase State revenue, rather than cover a cost of a transaction or service.  As such, the realty transfer fees in New Jersey are an abuse of legitimate fee processes.  In contrast, the Realty Transfer Tax Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is properly called a tax, as it is a state tax on the transaction of transferring realty. The elimination of the fees helps reduce costs to New Jerseyans and makes the New Jersey fee process more legitimate.
