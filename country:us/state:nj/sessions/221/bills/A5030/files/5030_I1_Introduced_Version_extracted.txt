Appeal of final municipal determinations in either regard are to be brought in the Superior Court Law Division, as defined in the ordinance, within 45 days of such determination. Despite the pendency of any challenge to or appeal of such determination, including to the Superior Court Law Division, the enforcing officer may file the notice of lien as provided section 4 of P.L.    , c. (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) for such amount as the enforcing officer has determined is the estimated cost to restore the fire damaged property. 4.    (New section) Upon the adoption of an ordinance by the governing body of a municipality permitting such notices of lien to be filed, the enforcing officer of the municipality shall cause a notice of intention to claim a lien, and the amount of the lien claimed by the municipality, against proceeds to be served upon the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance for entry in the index of municipalities maintained by the commissioner as provided in section 2 of P.L.1978, c.184 (C.17:36-9).  Thereafter, the enforcing officer shall render to any insurer a certificate containing the information required by such ordinance, which shall also be filed with the municipal clerk of the municipality in which the fire damaged property is located, and the amounts stated in the certificate shall be a lien on the proceeds of the insurance policy until paid or otherwise discharged as provided for pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) or ordinance adopted pursuant thereto.

STATEMENT This bill permits a municipality to place a lien on a fire-damaged propertys insurance proceeds in certain instances and requires fire and explosion insurance coverage for certain individuals. Under the bill, a municipality will be allowed to place a lien on a fire-damaged propertys insurance proceeds.

Municipalities that adopt an ordinance to allow the municipality to place a lien on a fire-damage propertys insurance proceeds must include a procedure within the ordinance to withhold payment by the insurer of the proceeds. The bill additionally provides that, for municipalities who adopt the ordinance, if reasonable proof that the damaged or destroyed portions of the insured structure is not received by or shown to an authorized representative of the municipality within 120 days after the policy proceeds was received by the municipality, the municipality may retain and use the policy proceeds to secure, repair, or demolish the structure and property to comply with local code requirements and applicable ordinances of the municipality. The bill also provides that the owner of a business or owner of a rental unit or units will be required to maintain liability insurance for damage cause by fire or explosion in an amount that is no less than $500,000 for combined property damage and bodily injury to or death of one or more person in any one accident or occurrence.  Owners of a multifamily home that is four or fewer units, one of which is owner-occupied, shall also maintain similar liability insurance for damage caused by a fire or explosion in an amount that is no less than $300,000 for combined property damage and bodily injury to or death of one or more person in any one accident or occurrence.

(cf: P.L.1985, c.519, s.2) 3     (New section) a.  Every municipality is hereby authorized to enact an ordinance empowering it to claim against the proceeds of a policy of fire insurance or homeowners insurance insuring the interest of an owner and issued on real property situated within such municipality covering residential property and also other real property as may be designated in the ordinance. Upon passage of such an ordinance, in addition to other liens that may arise under P.L.   , c.     (C.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the receipt by an insurance company of a claim under a homeowners or fire insurance policy for a loss to real property covered by the ordinance located within the municipality that is caused by fire or explosion creates a statutory lien up to the amount of coverage available for damages caused by fire or explosion, including any coverage for debris removal in favor of the municipality in which the property is situated for the purpose of effectuating the restoration of the fire damaged property, including the securing, repairing, replacing, removing, or demolition the property or any portion thereof as may be required, which shall, as to such coverage amount, be prior to all other liens and claims except the claim of a mortgagee of record named in the policy; provided, that the amount of the lien may not exceed the policy limits of coverage for the real property plus debris removal, if any and further; provided, however, that the lien created by this subsection does not apply to proceeds payable under the policy for any losses other than those to the real property insured, including loss of personal property and payments for temporary housing and related living expenses.  Payment of any proceeds subject to the lien shall be withheld by the insurer, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1 of P.L.1978, c.184 (C.17:36-8).  The lien shall be separate and apart from other liens and encumbrances which may arise under P.L.1978, c. 184. b.    Unless earlier released by a municipality as provided for in an ordinance adopted pursuant to this section, any such lien that arises shall expire if the municipality determines that the fire resulted in a total loss, or the municipality fails to provide notice as provided for in section 4 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), within: (1) 90 days of a fire or explosion; or (2) within 45 days of receipt of notice that an insurer or insured will assert that the fire resulted in a total loss or of the insurer or insured providing notice of a final settlement, whichever is later.  The enforcing officer, utilizing such procedure as may be provided for by ordinance, may determine to accept or deny an insurer or insureds determination as to the estimated cost to restore fire damaged property or assertion that the fire or explosion resulted in a total loss. c.     If not determined to be a total loss, the ordinance shall provide authority for the enforcing officer to communicate with the construction code official as to the estimated cost that would be required to restore the fire damaged property and provide procedures for an insurer or insured to challenge either such estimate determination, or a determination that a fire has not resulted in a total loss or a cost estimate that exceeds amount the final settlement. Appeal of final municipal determinations in either regard are to be brought in the Superior Court Law Division, as defined in the ordinance, within 45 days of such determination. Despite the pendency of any challenge to or appeal of such determination, including to the Superior Court Law Division, the enforcing officer may file the notice of lien as provided section 4 of P.L.    , c. (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) for such amount as the enforcing officer has determined is the estimated cost to restore the fire damaged property. 4.    (New section) Upon the adoption of an ordinance by the governing body of a municipality permitting such notices of lien to be filed, the enforcing officer of the municipality shall cause a notice of intention to claim a lien, and the amount of the lien claimed by the municipality, against proceeds to be served upon the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance for entry in the index of municipalities maintained by the commissioner as provided in section 2 of P.L.1978, c.184 (C.17:36-9).  Thereafter, the enforcing officer shall render to any insurer a certificate containing the information required by such ordinance, which shall also be filed with the municipal clerk of the municipality in which the fire damaged property is located, and the amounts stated in the certificate shall be a lien on the proceeds of the insurance policy until paid or otherwise discharged as provided for pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) or ordinance adopted pursuant thereto. The lien so filed shall expire: (a) upon completion of the restoration of the fire damaged property as defined by ordinance upon the production of an official certificate and on a form prescribed and certified by the municipality stating that further restoration is not required or that the cost of restoration of the fire damaged property has been paid; or (b) as provided for in section 14 of P.L.    , c.   (C.  ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 5.    (New section) No ordinance adopted pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be effective unless the ordinance provides for the release or return to the insured of any amounts subject to a lien to which it would otherwise be entitled to claim provided that the insured, including a new property owner, agrees with the municipality in writing to, within four months or 120 days, restore the fire damaged property to the same or improved condition that it was in prior to the fire or explosion, subject to any conditions the ordinance provides to guarantee the performance of the obligation including, but not limited to, an agreement to deposit proceeds in an escrow account or the provision of a performance bond or other adequate guarantee as may be provided by an ordinance adopted pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 6.    (New section) Any ordinance adopted pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall contain the procedures to effectuate the notices required or lien authorized by this section and otherwise withhold payment by an insurer of the proceeds of any insurance policy based upon a covered claim payment made for damage or loss to a building or other structure, caused by or arising out of any fire or explosion, not inconsistent with the terms hereof. 7.    (New section) Sections 3 through 24 of P.L.   , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not be deemed or construed to alter or impair the right of a municipality to acquire or enforce any lien against real property, or otherwise undertake, order,  arrange for or otherwise act to effectuate the restoration of the fire damaged property, but shall be in addition to any other power provided by law to acquire or enforce any such right. 8.    (New section)  If a lawsuit or arbitration is filed for a loss to the insured real property due to fire or explosion, notice of the lawsuit or arbitration shall be provided to the municipality, and the  enforcing officer and construction code official shall each be entitled to intervene in such proceeding as of right. 9.    (New section)  If the insured, including a new property owner, fails to agree with the municipality in writing to, within four months or 120 days, restore the fire damaged property to the same or improved condition that it was in prior to the damage caused by fire or explosion, or provide the guarantees set forth in section 5 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) or ordinance adopted pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) a municipality may escrow the amount withheld by the insurer, and to retain that amount.

STATEMENT This bill permits a municipality to place a lien on a fire-damaged propertys insurance proceeds in certain instances and requires fire and explosion insurance coverage for certain individuals. Under the bill, a municipality will be allowed to place a lien on a fire-damaged propertys insurance proceeds. A municipality that adopts an ordinance allowing these liens to be placed will be required to ensure that the ordinance provides for the release or return to the insured any amounts to which the insured would otherwise be entitled to claim, provided that the insured agrees with the municipality in writing to restore the fire damaged property to the same or improved condition that the premises was prior to the damage within four months or 120 days. Municipalities that adopt an ordinance to allow the municipality to place a lien on a fire-damage propertys insurance proceeds must include a procedure within the ordinance to withhold payment by the insurer of the proceeds. The bill additionally provides that, for municipalities who adopt the ordinance, if reasonable proof that the damaged or destroyed portions of the insured structure is not received by or shown to an authorized representative of the municipality within 120 days after the policy proceeds was received by the municipality, the municipality may retain and use the policy proceeds to secure, repair, or demolish the structure and property to comply with local code requirements and applicable ordinances of the municipality. The bill also provides that the owner of a business or owner of a rental unit or units will be required to maintain liability insurance for damage cause by fire or explosion in an amount that is no less than $500,000 for combined property damage and bodily injury to or death of one or more person in any one accident or occurrence.  Owners of a multifamily home that is four or fewer units, one of which is owner-occupied, shall also maintain similar liability insurance for damage caused by a fire or explosion in an amount that is no less than $300,000 for combined property damage and bodily injury to or death of one or more person in any one accident or occurrence.
