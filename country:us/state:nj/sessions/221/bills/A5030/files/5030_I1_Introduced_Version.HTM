municipality is hereby authorized to enact an ordinance empowering it to claim
against the proceeds of a policy of fire insurance or homeowners insurance
insuring the interest of an owner and issued on real property situated within
such municipality covering residential property and also other real property as
may be designated in the ordinance. Upon passage of such an ordinance, in
addition to other liens that may arise under P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill), the receipt by an insurance
company of a claim under a homeowners or fire insurance policy for a loss to
real property covered by the ordinance located within the municipality that is caused
by fire or explosion creates a statutory lien up to the amount of coverage
available for damages caused by fire or explosion, including any coverage for
debris removal in favor of the municipality in which the property is situated
for the purpose of effectuating the restoration of the fire damaged property, including
the securing, repairing, replacing, removing, or demolition the property or any
portion thereof as may be required, which shall, as to such coverage amount, be
prior to all other liens and claims except the claim of a mortgagee of record
named in the policy; provided, that the amount of the lien may not exceed the
policy limits of coverage for the real property plus debris removal, if any and
further; provided, however, that the lien created by this subsection does not
apply to proceeds payable under the policy for any losses other than those to
the real property insured, including loss of personal property and payments for
temporary housing and related living expenses.  Payment of any proceeds subject
to the lien shall be withheld by the insurer, notwithstanding the provisions of
section 1 of P.L.1978, c.184 (C.17:36-8).  The lien shall be separate and apart
from other liens and encumbrances which may arise under P.L.1978, c. 184.</p>

before the Legislature as this bill), within: (1) 90 days of a fire or
explosion; or (2) within 45 days of receipt of notice that an insurer or
insured will assert that the fire resulted in a total loss or of the insurer or
insured providing notice of a final settlement, whichever is later.  The
enforcing officer, utilizing such procedure as may be provided for by
ordinance, may determine to accept or deny an insurer or insureds
determination as to the estimated cost to restore fire damaged property or
assertion that the fire or explosion resulted in a total loss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If not determined to be
a total loss, the ordinance shall provide authority for the enforcing officer
to communicate with the construction code official as to the estimated cost
that would be required to restore the fire damaged property and provide
procedures for an insurer or insured to challenge either such estimate
determination, or a determination that a fire has not resulted in a total loss
or a cost estimate that exceeds amount the final settlement. Appeal of final
municipal determinations in either regard are to be brought in the Superior
Court Law Division, as defined in the ordinance, within 45 days of such
determination. Despite the pendency of any challenge to or appeal of such
determination, including to the Superior Court Law Division, the enforcing
officer may file the notice of lien as provided section 4 of P.L.    , c.

c.92 (C.40A:10A-1) is amended to read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  Except as provided
in subsection b. of this section, the owner of a business or the owner of a
rental unit or units shall maintain liability insurance for negligent acts and

than $500,000 for combined property damage and bodily injury to or death of one

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The owner of a
multifamily home which is four or fewer units, one of which is owner-occupied,
shall maintain liability insurance for negligent acts and omissions <u>and
damage caused by fire or explosion</u> in an amount of no less than $300,000
for combined property damage and bodily injury to or death of one or more

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2022, c.92, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     26.  This act shall take
effect on the 180th day next following enactment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill permits a
municipality to place a lien on a fire-damaged propertys insurance proceeds in
certain instances and requires fire and explosion insurance coverage for
certain individuals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a municipality
will be allowed to place a lien on a fire-damaged propertys insurance
proceeds. A municipality that adopts an ordinance allowing these liens to be
placed will be required to ensure that the ordinance provides for the release
or return to the insured any amounts to which the insured would otherwise be
entitled to claim, provided that the insured agrees with the municipality in
writing to restore the fire damaged property to the same or improved condition
that the premises was prior to the damage within four months or 120 days. 
Municipalities that adopt an ordinance to allow the municipality to place a
lien on a fire-damage propertys insurance proceeds must include a procedure
within the ordinance to withhold payment by the insurer of the proceeds. The
bill additionally provides that, for municipalities who adopt the ordinance, if
reasonable proof that the damaged or destroyed portions of the insured
structure is not received by or shown to an authorized representative of the
municipality within 120 days after the policy proceeds was received by the
municipality, the municipality may retain and use the policy proceeds to
secure, repair, or demolish the structure and property to comply with local code
requirements and applicable ordinances of the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
the owner of a business or owner of a rental unit or units will be required to
maintain liability insurance for damage cause by fire or explosion in an amount
that is no less than $500,000 for combined property damage and bodily injury to
or death of one or more person in any one accident or occurrence.  Owners of a
multifamily home that is four or fewer units, one of which is owner-occupied,
shall also maintain similar liability insurance for damage caused by a fire or
explosion in an amount that is no less than $300,000 for combined property
damage and bodily injury to or death of one or more person in any one accident
or occurrence.</p>
