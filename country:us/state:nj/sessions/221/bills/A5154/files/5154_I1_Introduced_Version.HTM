(2)   A grant by the State for lands to be acquired by a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization for a Blue Acres project may include up to 50 percent of the Blue Acres cost of acquisition of the lands by the qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization. (a)   A qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization shall not use as its matching share of the Blue Acres cost of acquisition of lands for a Blue Acres project any constitutionally dedicated moneys, as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-3), or any grant moneys obtained from a Green Acres bond act. (b)   To qualify to receive a grant from the Preserve New Jersey Blue Acres Fund, the board of directors or governing body of the applying tax exempt nonprofit organization shall: (i)    demonstrate to the commissioner that the organization qualifies as a charitable conservancy for the purposes of P.L.1979, c.378 (C.13:8B-1 et seq.); (ii)   demonstrate that the organization has the resources to match the grant requested; (iii)  agree to make and keep the lands accessible to the public, unless the commissioner determines that public accessibility would be detrimental to the lands or any natural resources associated therewith; (iv)  agree not to convey the lands except to the federal government, the State, a local government unit, or another qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization, for recreation and conservation purposes; and (v)   agree to execute and donate to the State at no charge a conservation restriction pursuant to P.L.1979, c.378 (C.13:8B-1 et seq.) on the lands to be acquired with the grant. l.     In addition to any other reporting requirements required by law, the department shall annually send a written report to the Chairperson of the Senate Environment and Energy Committee, the Assembly Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, and the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee, or their successors, identifying the projects funded with moneys pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of subsection j. of this section.  This report shall:  (1) identify the project type, location, and cost for each development project; and (2) identify the stewardship activities, including the location and cost for each stewardship activity, undertaken on lands administered by the Division of Fish and Wildlife and Division of Parks and Forestry pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of subsection j. of this section. (cf:  P.L.2019, c.136, s.3) 2.    Section 10 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-52) is amended to read: 10.  a.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 27 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-27) to the contrary, a grant by the State for lands acquired or developed for recreation and conservation purposes by a local government unit in a municipality eligible to receive State aid pursuant to P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178 et seq.) shall be for 75 percent of the cost of acquisition or development of the lands by the local government unit, except that the department may authorize an increase in the State's share of the cost up to 100 percent of the allowable funding cap established by the department upon a demonstration of special need or exceptional circumstances. b.    A local government unit or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization may use a grant or loan received pursuant to this act for recreation and conservation purposes for the construction of a community garden, provided that public access to the lands acquired for recreation and conservation purposes is not limited by the community garden. c.     A grant by the State to a local government unit that is not a municipality eligible to receive State aid pursuant to P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178 et seq.) for development of a completely inclusive playground, including the retrofit of an existing playground as a completely inclusive playground, by the local government unit shall be for 50 percent of the cost of development of the playground. (cf: P.L.2016, c.12, s.10) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides that 10 percent of the Green Acres funding provided for grants and loans to fund local government open space acquisition and development projects would be allocated as grants for the development of completely inclusive playgrounds by local government units. The Preserve New Jersey Act implements the constitutional dedication of corporation business tax (CBT) revenues for open space, farmland, and historic preservation.  For State fiscal years 2020 and after, the act provides that of the amount deposited each State fiscal year:  60 percent shall be used for State open space acquisition and development projects; 30 percent shall be used for grants and loans to fund local government open space acquisition and development projects; and 10 percent shall be used for grants to fund open space acquisition and development projects undertaken by qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organizations.  Currently, the Green Acres program requires all development projects to comply with all applicable federal and State requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and barrier free codes. This bill would provide that of the funding for local government open space acquisition and development projects, 10 percent would be allocated as grants for the development of completely inclusive playgrounds, including the retrofitting of existing playgrounds, by local government units.  The bill further provides that a grant by the State for development of a completely inclusive playground by a local government unit that is not an urban aid municipality would be for 50 percent of the cost of development of the playground. This bill would provide that a portion of Green Acres funds be specifically allocated for the development of completely inclusive playgrounds by counties and municipalities.
