<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 9 of P.L.1971,
c.137 (C.5:10-9) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.  a.  Upon the exercise of
the power of eminent domain, the compensation to be paid thereunder shall be
ascertained and paid in the manner provided in chapter 1 of Title 20 of the
Revised Statutes insofar as the provisions thereof are applicable and not
inconsistent with the provisions contained in this act.  The  authority may
join in separate subdivisions in one petition or complaint the descriptions of
any number of tracts or parcels of land or property to be condemned and the
names of any number of owners and other parties who may have an interest
therein and all such land or property included in said petition or complaint
may be condemned in a single proceeding;  provided, however, that separate
awards be made for each tract or parcel of land or property; and provided
further, that each of said tracts or parcels of land or property lies wholly in
or has a substantial part of its value lying wholly within the same county.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Upon the filing of such
petition or complaint or at any time thereafter  the authority may file with
the clerk of the county in which such property is  located and also with the
Clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by the authority
declaring that possession of one or more of the tracts  or parcels of land or
property described in the petition or complaint is thereby being taken by and
for the use of the authority.  The said declaration of taking shall be
sufficient if it sets forth (1) a description of each tract or parcel of land
or property to be so taken sufficient for the identification  thereof to which
there shall be attached a plan or map thereof; (2) a statement of the estate or
interest in the said land or property being taken; (3) a statement of the sum
of money estimated by the authority by resolution to be just compensation for
the taking of the estate or interest in each tract or parcel of land or
property described in said declaration; and (4) that, in compliance with the
provisions of the act, the authority has established and is maintaining a trust
fund as hereinafter provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Upon the filing of the
said declaration, the authority shall deposit with the Clerk of the Superior
Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration.  In
addition to the said deposits with the Clerk of the Superior Court the
authority at all times shall maintain a special trust fund on deposit with a
bank or trust company doing business in the State in an  account at least equal
to twice the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as
estimated compensation for all property described in  declarations of taking
with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid
to the persons entitled thereto or into court.  Said trust fund shall consist
of cash or securities readily convertible into cash constituting legal
investment for trust funds under the laws of the State.  Said trust fund shall
be held solely to secure and may be applied to the payment of just compensation
for the land or other property described in such declarations of taking.  The
authority shall be entitled to withdraw from said trust fund from time to time
so much as may then be in excess of twice the aggregate of the amount deposited
with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property
described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has
not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into
court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  Upon the filing of the
said declaration as aforesaid and depositing with the Clerk of the Superior
Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration, the
authority without other process or proceedings, shall be entitled to the
exclusive possession and use of each tract of land or property described in
said declaration and may forthwith enter into and take  possession of said land
or property, it being the intent of this provision that the proceedings for
compensation or any other proceedings relating to the taking of said land or
interest therein or other property shall not delay the taking of possession
thereof and the use thereof by the authority for the purpose or purposes for
which the authority is authorized by law to acquire or condemn such land or
other property or interest therein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The authority shall cause
notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit to be
served upon each party in interest named in the petition residing in the State,
either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at <b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>his<b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>the persons</u> residence,
if known, and upon each party in interest residing out of the State, by mailing
a copy thereof to <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>him<b><span

style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>the
persons</u> residence, if known. In the event that the residence of any such
party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at
least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in
which the land is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made
within 10 days after filing such declaration.  Upon the application of any
party in interest and after notice to other parties in interest, including the
authority, any judge of the superior court assigned to sit for said county may
order that the money deposited with  the Clerk of the Superior Court or any
part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or
on account of the just compensation  to be awarded in said proceeding; 
provided, that each such person shall have filed with the Clerk of the Superior
Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award in the condemnation
proceeding shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after notice as
herein provided and hearing, may determine <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>his<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>the
persons</u> liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part
thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally
determined shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom
the award is payable shall be entitled to recover from the authority the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     13.  Section 13 of P.L.1958,
c.34 (C.58:22-13) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     13.  Whenever the power of
condemnation is exercised by the department pursuant to this act, the
provisions of chapter 1 of Title 20 (Eminent Domain) of the Revised Statutes,
as amended and supplemented, shall be applicable and such power of condemnation
shall include the condemnation of public as well as privately owned property,
except as otherwise provided by this act.  Upon the institution of an action to
fix the compensation to be paid, or at any time thereafter, the department may
file with the Clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by
the department, declaring that the possession of 1 or more of the tracts or
parcels of property described in the petition is thereby being taken by and for
the use of the department.  The declaration of taking shall be sufficient if it
sets forth<u>:</u> (1) a description of each tract or parcel of property to be
taken; (2) a statement of the estate or interest in the said property being
taken; and (3) a statement of the sum of money estimated by the department to
be just compensation for the taking.  Upon the filing of said declaration, the
department shall deposit with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the
estimated compensation stated in said declaration.  Upon the filing of the
declaration and the depositing with the Clerk of the  Superior Court the amount
of the estimated compensation as stated in the declaration, the department,
without other process or proceedings<u>,</u> shall be entitled to the exclusive
possession and use of each tract or parcel of property described in the
declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said property,
it being the intent of this provision that the action to fix the compensation
to be paid or any other proceeding relating to the taking of such property or
entering therein shall not delay the taking of possession and the use thereof
by the department for purposes authorized by this act.  The department shall
not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which it
has taken possession of the property as herein provided.  The department shall
cause notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit
to be served upon each party to the action to fix the compensation to be paid,
who resides in this State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>his<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>the
persons</u> residence, and upon each such party who resides out of the State
by mailing copy thereof to <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>him<b><span

at <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>his<b><span

persons</u> residence.  In the event that the residence of any such party or
the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once
in the newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which
the property is located.  Such service, mailing or publishing shall be made
within 10 days after the filing of the declaration.  Upon the application of
any party in interest and after  notice to other parties in interest, including
the department, the Superior Court may direct that the money deposited with the
Clerk of the Superior Court  or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person
or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be
awarded in such action; provided, that each person shall have filed with the
Clerk of the Superior  Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award
in the action shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after such
notice as the court  prescribes and a hearing, may determine the liability, if
any, for the return of such difference or any part thereof and enter judgment
therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally determined by the court shall
exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award is
payable shall be entitled to recover from the department the difference between
the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at the
rate <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>of
6% per annum<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>] </span></b><u>fixed
and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of
P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32)</u> thereon from the date of the making of the
deposit.  If the amount  of the award shall be less than the amount so
deposited, the Clerk of the Superior Court shall return the difference between
the amount of the award and the deposit to the department unless the amount of
the deposit or any part thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in
which event the court, upon  application of the department and notice to all
parties interested in the award and affording them an opportunity to be heard,
shall enter judgment in favor of  the department for such difference against
the party or parties liable for the  return thereof.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill replaces the fixed
interest rate award in eminent domain cases with an interest rate based on just
compensation awards.  Under current law, interest rate awards in certain
eminent domain cases are either (1) fixed at 6 percent or (2) set at an
applicable legal rate.  This bill eliminates those fixed rates and provides
that the interest will be fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner
after final determination of compensation.  Under the bill, in making its
determination, the court may consider any relevant factors, including but not
limited to: prevailing commercial interest rates, the prime rate or rates, the
applicable legal rates of interest, and an appropriate interest rate on a just
compensation award that justly indemnifies the condemnee for the loss of the
use of the compensation to which the condemnee was entitled.</p>
