class=HangingAnActChar> concerning the design of primary election ballots,
supplementing Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, amending various parts of the
statutory law, and repealing R.S.19:34-52 and P.L.1981, c.71. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The Elections Clause of
the United States Constitution grants the State with the right and ability to
make laws concerning the time, place, and manner of elections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    State and Federal courts
have frequently deferred to the State Legislature to enact such laws and
balance the respective interests of the State, candidates for offices, and the
voters, a function for which the Legislature is uniquely fitted.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     As per the ruling of
Judge Quraishi of the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey, the bracketing structure used in New Jerseys primary election ballots
was primarily created by the combined effect of three statutes: R.S.19:23-24;
section 1 of P.L.1981, c.71 (C.19:23-26.1); and R.S.19:49-2.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The combined effect of
these three statutes created unique ballot conditions such as incongruous
separation, preferential placement for certain candidates based upon the
drawing of candidates for different offices, and improper placement of certain
candidates amongst candidates for different offices on the ballot.  These
conditions led to two legal challenges in federal district court, where
Plaintiffs asserted that the bracketing structure impermissibly burdened their
rights under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Prior to a decision
being reached in either of these cases, the leaders of the New Jersey State
Legislature committed to remedying the combined effect of these statutes and
pledged to design a new primary election ballot for use in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     In furtherance of this
commitment, the General Assembly convened the Select Committee on Ballot
Design, comprised of an equal number of members of both parties in the General
Assembly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The Select Committee on
Ballot Design met in a series of five public hearings to take testimony from
experts and the public alike in order to better understand the issue and
balance the interests of the many perspectives presented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The design of the new
primary election ballot, to be established by this act, P.L.    , c.   
(pending before the Legislature as this bill), took into consideration the
expertise of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the county clerks and
election officials, who are ultimately responsible for implementation of the
design;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  the National Conference
of State Legislatures, which provided the committee with expert testimony and
research concerning ballot design and other election matters, including the
relevant practices in other states;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  the Center for Civic
Design, which provided the committee with expert testimony, and whose research
and guidance on standardized and user-friendly ballot design principles are
publicly available; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  members of the public,
many of whom spoke in support of an office block ballot design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The new ballot design
for primary election ballots also seeks to further important government
interests, such as ensuring timely and orderly election processes, of which the
primary election is an integral part.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     As the most critical
stage in the electoral process is the instant before the vote is cast, the
design for the new primary election ballots seeks to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  ensure that voters can
understand the ballot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  maintain a manageable
ballot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  reduce voter confusion;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  provide voters with
information as to the policy positions and endorsements of the candidates
running for office; and</p>

may express their political opinions through the casting of their vote.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     The design of the new
primary ballot preserves the ability of political parties to make endorsements,
since party labels provide a shorthand designation of the views of party
candidates, and the identification of candidates with a particular party plays
a role in the process by which voters inform themselves for the exercise of the
franchise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.   This design also takes
into consideration the First Amendment rights of political parties and their
governing bodies, recognizing that primary elections are, at their core, a
function of the party and therefore not a public affair which may be overly
regulated by the State.  This principle has routinely been upheld by the United
States Supreme Court and courts in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.    This design seeks also
to preserve the First Amendment rights of candidates who wish to legitimately

that any candidates associate, while also safeguarding against abuses of the
candidate slogans <b><sup><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>1</span></sup></b><u>,
such as the use of misleading or false slogans which could be deceptive to a
reasonable voter</u><b><sup><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>1</span></sup></b>.</p>
