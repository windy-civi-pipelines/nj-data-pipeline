STATEMENT This bill requires that the definition of minority business enterprise (MBE) include persons of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent for State certification and assistance purposes and school board and local government contract set-aside purposes. Under current law, small businesses owned by persons of Middle Eastern and North African descent are not included in the various statutory definitions of minority businesses.  The exclusions of persons of Middle Eastern and North African descent in this definition has led to certain small business owners from being able to certify as a minority business enterprise.  This lack of certification by the State means certain small business owners do not qualify for the various programs and benefits afforded to minority business enterprises at the State and local level. The MENA communities in this State and on the federal level are categorized as white.   However, there is a lack of access in contracting and through daily life that many in the MENA community face.  Many people in the MENA community often compare their experiences to those in communities of color. This bill revises and clarifies that the various definitions of minority business enterprises include persons of Middle Eastern and North African descent.  This inclusion would allow those small business owners to benefit from the programs and financial assistance afforded to small businesses certified as minority businesses.
