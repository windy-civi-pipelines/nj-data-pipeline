Under the bill, failure of a municipality to comply with one of these three alternative requirements will result in the bills first alternative, a minimum lot size for development of a dwelling in each residential district at no more than one-quarter acre, to be applicable for the municipality, and would prohibit the municipality from enforcing any development regulation to the contrary. The bill provides that its provisions do not apply to dwellings located within historic districts or to residential lots that are subject to certain covenants or restrictions.
