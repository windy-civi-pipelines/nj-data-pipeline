style='line-height:150%;font-variant:small-caps'>An Act</span></b> authorizing
the creation of a debt of the State of New Jersey by the issuance of bonds of
the State in the aggregate principal amount of $150 million for the purpose of
providing financing for the purchase of development rights for proposed
warehouse sites; providing the ways and means to pay and discharge the
principal of and interest on the bonds; providing for the submission of this
act to the people at a general election; and making an appropriation therefor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b><i> by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  This act shall be known
and may be cited as the &quot;Warehouse Development Control Bond Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  The Legislature finds and
declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  The development of
warehouses within a host municipality often results in land use, traffic,
environmental, economic, fiscal, and social equity effects in the host
municipality, and may adversely impact the overall region in which the
warehouse is being proposed for development;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Municipalities are often
faced with a choice between the development of housing, which results in a
higher demand for schools and other government services without an equivalent
increase in property taxes, and warehouse development, which may negatively
impact the character of the municipality, as well as affecting the farming
areas, open space, recreation areas, and areas of historic and cultural
significance in the municipality;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Frequently, this choice
represents a Hobson's choice, with warehouse development representing the only
option that is fiscally viable for the municipality; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  Therefore, it is in the
interest of the State to offer municipalities a program through which the
municipality can purchase the development rights of a proposed warehouse site,
preserving the positive fiscal benefit of the real property to the
municipality, providing compensation to the landowner, and avoiding the
negative consequences associated with warehouse development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Bonds&quot; mean the
bonds authorized to be issued, or issued, under this act.</p>

the New Jersey Commission on Capital Budgeting and Planning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Commissioner&quot; means
the Commissioner of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Cost&quot; means the
expenses incurred in connection with: a purchase of development rights of a
proposed warehouse site; the execution of any agreements and franchises deemed
by the department to be necessary or useful and convenient in connection with
any purchase of development rights authorized by this act; the procurement or
provision of engineering, inspection, planning, legal, financial, or other
professional services, estimates, studies, reports, or advice, including the
services of a bond registrar or an authenticating agent; feasibility studies;
the issuance of bonds, or any interest or discount thereon; the administrative,
organizational, operating, or other expenses incident to the financing and
completing of any project authorized by this act; the establishment of a
reserve fund or funds for working capital, operating, maintenance, or
replacement expenses and for the payment or security of principal or interest
on bonds, as the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the
Department of the Treasury may determine; and reimbursement to any fund of the
State of moneys which may have been transferred or advanced therefrom to any
fund created by this act, or of any moneys which may have been expended
therefrom for, or in connection with, any project authorized by this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Department&quot; means
the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Government
securities&quot; means any bonds or other obligations which as to principal and
interest constitute direct obligations of, or are unconditionally guaranteed
by, the United States of America, including obligations of any federal agency,
to the extent those obligations are unconditionally guaranteed by the United
States of America, and any certificates or any other evidences of an ownership
interest in those obligations of, or unconditionally guaranteed by, the United
States of America or in specified portions which may consist of the principal
of, or the interest on, those obligations.</p>

that stores cargo, goods, or products of any type on a short-term or long-term
basis for later distribution to wholesale or retail customers, and includes,
but is not limited to, a distribution center, flex-warehouse, or any other type
of warehouse. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    The commissioner shall
adopt, pursuant to the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968 c.410
(C.52:14B&#8209;1 et seq.), rules and regulations necessary to implement the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  acquire the development
rights of a real property in the form of an easement that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  is recorded on the title
of that property;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  permanently restricts the
development of the property, and provides that any subdivision of a property in
agricultural use ensures that the resulting parcels are not lesser in size than
the minimum size required for qualification for farmland assessment pursuant to
the &quot;Farmland Assessment Act of 1964,&quot; P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et
seq.) plus one acre, and that the resulting parcels remain in agricultural use;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)  authorizes the landowner
to retain all other rights and responsibilities associated with the property,
including the ability to sell the property, provided that the terms of the sale
are consistent with the easement, and, if the property is a farm, to farm the
land without restriction and in the same manner as a farm that retains its
development rights and to construct or maintain one single-family home on the
farm or any subdivision thereof;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  demonstrate to the
department's satisfaction that the property of which the development rights are
to be purchased is a proposed warehouse site, provided that only a real property
that is subject to local property taxation shall be considered to be a proposed
warehouse site;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  provide matching funds of
a least 50 percent of the sale price of the development rights; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  not condemn or threaten
to condemn the site in order to incentivize the sale of development rights by
the landowner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  When making a valuation of
the development rights of a proposed warehouse site, a municipality may:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  use the difference
between the value of the undeveloped property and the value of the property, if
developed, or use the municipal average of the value of the development rights
of properties in the municipality, in order to calculate the value of the
development rights of the property, provided that the higher valuation from these
two methods of calculation is offered to the landowner; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  include the value of
avoided carbon dioxide emissions caused by the purchase of development rights
in the sale price.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  The department shall
develop an application process for grants issued pursuant to this act, and may
develop other eligibility criteria.  The grant program shall be voluntary and
open to every municipality in the State.  A municipality may contract with a
nonprofit organization or county to carry out the application process on the
municipality's behalf.  The department shall develop priority ranking criteria
for the award of grants.  The priority ranking criteria shall provide
additional priority to a municipality:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  that has a significant
watershed or other ecologically sensitive area within its borders;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  that has an above average
number of residents who rely on wells for drinking water or septic systems for
wastewater management; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  in which the construction
of a warehouse may otherwise adversely affect the environment or ecology of the
municipality or an adjoining municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  In order to secure the
matching funds for a grant issued pursuant to this section, a municipality may
use:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) donations from private
donors, including nonprofit organizations; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  any municipal or county
funds, including, but not limited to, moneys from a County Open Space,
Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust
Fund or a Municipal Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland
and Historic Preservation Trust Fund established pursuant to P.L.1997, c.24
(C.40:12-15.1 et seq.), moneys provided to the municipality or county through
the Green Acres program, or moneys that result from the State's participation
in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, provided that such use is consistent
with existing State and federal law.</p>

provisions of this act relating to the issuance of bonds, and shall determine
all matters in connection therewith, subject to the provisions of this act.  If
an issuing official is absent from the State or incapable of acting for any
reason, the powers and duties of that issuing official shall be exercised and
performed by the person authorized by law to act in an official capacity in the

payment of the principal thereof at maturity or earlier redemption date.  The
principal of and interest on the bonds shall be exempt from taxation by the
State or by any county, municipality or other taxing district of the State.</p>

manual or facsimile signature of the Secretary of State, or an Assistant
Secretary of State, and shall be countersigned by the facsimile signature of
the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the

approved by a majority of the legally qualified voters of the State voting
thereon at the election.  This recital shall be conclusive evidence of the
authority of the State to issue the bonds and their validity.  Any bonds
containing this recital shall, in any suit, action or proceeding involving
their validity, be conclusively deemed to be fully authorized by this act and

such rate or rates of interest as may be determined by the issuing officials,
which interest shall be payable semiannually; except that the first and last
interest periods may be longer or shorter, in order that intervening semiannual
payments may be at convenient dates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  The bonds shall be issued

as the issuing officials may prescribe, after notice of the sale, published at
least once in at least three newspapers published in this State, and at least
once in a publication carrying municipal bond notices and devoted primarily to
financial news, published in this State or in the city of New York, the first
notice to appear at least five days prior to the day of bidding.  The notice of
sale may contain a provision to the effect that any bid in pursuance thereof

separate fund, and shall be deposited in such depositories as may be selected
by the State Treasurer to the credit of the fund, which fund shall be known as
the &quot;Warehouse Development Control Bond Fund.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     15.  a.  The moneys in the
&quot;Warehouse Development Control Bond Fund&quot; are specifically dedicated

development rights of proposed warehouse sites, as set forth in section 5 of
this act.  However, no moneys in the fund shall be expended for those purposes,
except as otherwise authorized by this act, without the specific appropriation
thereof by the Legislature, but bonds may be issued as herein provided,
notwithstanding that the Legislature shall not have then adopted an act making
a specific appropriation of any of the moneys.  Any act appropriating moneys
from the &quot;Warehouse Development Control Bond Fund&quot; shall identify the
project to be funded by the moneys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  At any time prior to the
issuance and sale of bonds under this act, the State Treasurer is authorized to
transfer from any available moneys in any fund of the treasury of the State to
the credit of the &quot;Warehouse Development Control Bond Fund&quot; those
sums as the State Treasurer may deem necessary.  The sums so transferred shall
be returned to the same fund of the treasury of the State by the State
Treasurer from the proceeds of the sale of the first issue of bonds.</p>

officials evidence satisfactory to them of the loss, mutilation or destruction
of the bond or coupon, the ownership thereof, and security, indemnity and
reimbursement for expenses connected therewith, as the issuing officials may
require.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     17.  The accrued interest, if
any, received upon the sale of the bonds shall be applied to the discharge of a

authenticating, registering, legal or other services necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon them by the provisions of this act shall be paid from the
proceeds of the sale of the bonds by the State Treasurer, upon the warrant of

a direct obligation of the State of New Jersey, and the faith and credit of the
State shall no longer be pledged to the payment of the principal of, redemption
premium, if any, and interest on the bonds, and the bonds shall be secured
solely by and payable solely from moneys and government securities deposited in
trust with one or more trustees or escrow agents, which trustees and escrow
agents shall be trust companies or national or state banks having powers of a
trust company, located either within or without the State, as provided herein,
whenever there shall be deposited in trust with the trustees or escrow agents,
as provided herein, either moneys or government securities, including
government securities issued or held in book-entry form on the books of the
Department of Treasury of the United States, the principal of and interest on
which when due will provide money which, together with the moneys, if any,
deposited with the trustees or escrow agents at the same time, shall be
sufficient to pay when due the principal of, redemption premium, if any, and
interest due and to become due on the bonds on or prior to the redemption date
or maturity date thereof, as the case may be; provided the government
securities shall not be subject to redemption prior to their maturity other
than at the option of the holder thereof.  The State of New Jersey hereby
covenants with the holders of any bonds for which government securities or
moneys shall have been deposited in trust with the trustees or escrow agents as
provided in this section that, except as otherwise provided in this section,
neither the government securities nor moneys so deposited with the trustees or
escrow agents shall be withdrawn or used by the State for any purpose other
than, and shall be held in trust for, the payment of the principal of,
redemption premium, if any, and interest to become due on the bonds; provided
that any cash received from the principal or interest payments on the
government securities deposited with the trustees or escrow agents, to the extent
the cash will not be required at any time for that purpose, shall be paid over
to the State, as received by the trustees or escrow agents, free and clear of
any trust, lien, pledge or assignment securing the bonds; and to the extent the
cash will be required for that purpose at a later date, shall, to the extent
practicable and legally permissible, be reinvested in government securities
maturing at times and in amounts sufficient to pay when due the principal of,
redemption premium, if any, and interest to become due on the bonds on and
prior to the redemption date or maturity date thereof, as the case may be, and
interest earned from the reinvestments shall be paid over to the State, as
received by the trustees or escrow agents, free and clear of any trust, lien or
pledge securing the bonds.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein:  a.  the trustees or escrow agents shall, if so directed by the issuing
officials, apply moneys on deposit with the trustees or escrow agents pursuant
to the provisions of this section, and redeem or sell government securities so
deposited with the trustees or escrow agents, and apply the proceeds thereof to
(1) the purchase of the bonds which were refinanced by the deposit with the
trustees or escrow agents of the moneys and government securities and
immediately thereafter cancel all bonds so purchased, or (2) the purchase of
different government securities; provided however, that the moneys and
government securities on deposit with the trustees or escrow agents after the
purchase and cancellation of the bonds or the purchase of different government
securities shall be sufficient to pay when due the principal of, redemption
premium, if any, and interest on all other bonds in respect of which the moneys
and government securities were deposited with the trustees or escrow agents on
or prior to the redemption date or maturity date thereof, as the case may be;
and b. in the event that on any date, as a result of any purchases and
cancellations of bonds or any purchases of different government securities, as
provided in this sentence, the total amount of moneys and government securities
remaining on deposit with the trustees or escrow agents is in excess of the
total amount which would have been required to be deposited with the trustees
or escrow agents on that date in respect of the remaining bonds for which the
deposit was made in order to pay when due the principal of, redemption premium,
if any, and interest on the remaining bonds, the trustees or escrow agents shall,
if so directed by the issuing officials, pay the amount of the excess to the
State, free and clear of any trust, lien, pledge or assignment securing the
refunding bonds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     20.  Refunding bonds issued
pursuant to P.L.1985, c.74 as amended by P.L.1992, c.182 (C.49:2B-1 et seq.)

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     21.  To provide funds to meet
the interest and principal payment requirements for the bonds and refunding
bonds issued under this act and outstanding, there is appropriated in the order
following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  Revenue derived from the
collection of taxes under the &quot;Sales and Use Tax Act,&quot; P.L.1966, c.30
(C.54:32B-1 et seq.), or so much thereof as may be required; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  If, at any time, funds
necessary to meet the interest, redemption premium, if any, and principal
payments on outstanding bonds issued under this act are insufficient or not
available, there shall be assessed, levied and collected annually in each of
the municipalities of the counties of this State, a tax on the real and
personal property upon which municipal taxes are or shall be assessed, levied
and collected, sufficient to meet the interest on all outstanding bonds issued
hereunder and on the bonds proposed to be issued under this act in the calendar
year in which the tax is to be raised and for the payment of bonds falling due
in the year following the year for which the tax is levied.  The tax shall be
assessed, levied and collected in the same manner and at the same time as are
other taxes upon real and personal property.  The governing body of each
municipality shall cause to be paid to the county treasurer of the county in
which the municipality is located, on or before December 15 in each year, the
amount of tax herein directed to be assessed and levied, and the county
treasurer shall pay the amount of the tax to the State Treasurer on or before
December 20 in each year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If on or before December 31 in
any year, the issuing officials, by resolution, determine that there are moneys
in the General Fund beyond the needs of the State, sufficient to pay the
principal of bonds falling due and all interest and redemption premium, if any,
payable in the ensuing calendar year, the issuing officials shall file the
resolution in the office of the State Treasurer, whereupon the State Treasurer
shall transfer the moneys to a separate fund to be designated by the State
Treasurer, and shall pay the principal, redemption premium, if any, and interest
out of that fund as the same shall become due and payable, and the other
sources of payment of the principal, redemption premium, if any, and interest
provided for in this section shall not then be available, and the receipts for
the year from the tax specified in subsection a. of this section shall be
considered and treated as part of the General Fund, available for general
purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     22.  Should the State
Treasurer, by December 31 of any year, deem it necessary, because of the
insufficiency of funds collected from the sources of revenues as provided in
this act, to meet the interest and principal payments for the year after the
ensuing year, then the State Treasurer shall certify to the Director of the
Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury the amount
necessary to be raised by taxation for those purposes, the same to be assessed,
levied and collected for and in the ensuing calendar year.  The director shall,
on or before March 1 following, calculate the amount in dollars to be assessed,
levied and collected in each county as herein set forth.  This calculation
shall be based upon the corrected assessed valuation of each county for the
year preceding the year in which the tax is to be assessed, but the tax shall
be assessed, levied and collected upon the assessed valuation of the year in
which the tax is assessed and levied.  The director shall certify the amount to
the county board of taxation and the treasurer of each county.  The county
board of taxation shall include the proper amount in the current tax levy of
the several taxing districts of the county in proportion to the ratables as
ascertained for the current year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, entitled the
&quot;Warehouse Development Control Bond Act,&quot; authorizes the issuance of
$150 million in State general obligation bonds to be used to provide matching
grants to municipalities to pay for the cost of purchasing the development
rights of proposed warehouse sites.  The Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP) would establish procedures for the review and approval of, and
eligibility criteria for, the grants, pursuant to section 5 of the bill. 
Grants would be issued according to a priority system to be developed by the
DEP.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would establish
certain conditions on the purchase of development rights, as enumerated in
section 5 of the bill.  For example, a municipality would be required to
acquire the development rights of the property in the form of an easement that:
(a) is recorded on the title of that property; (b) permanently restricts the
development of the property, and provides that any subdivision of a property in
agricultural use ensures that the resulting parcels are not lesser in size than
the minimum size required for qualification for farmland assessment pursuant to
the &quot;Farmland Assessment Act of 1964,&quot; P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et
seq.) plus one acre, and that the resulting parcels remain in agricultural use;
and (c) authorizes the landowner to retain all other rights and
responsibilities associated with the property, including the ability to sell
the property, provided that the terms of the sale are consistent with the
easement, and, if the property is a farm, to farm the land without restriction
and in the same manner as a farm that retains its development rights and to
construct or maintain one single-family home on the farm or any subdivision
thereof.  The intent of allowing the subdivision of farmland for which an
easement against future development has been sold is to allow smaller farms to
be created with single-family housing to promote new or young farmers
purchasing land that otherwise would require too much capital.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
bond act is to be submitted to the people for approval at the general election
to be held at least 70 days after enactment and appropriates $5,000 to the
Department of State for expenses in connection with the publication of the
public question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The development of warehouses
within a host municipality often results in land use, traffic, environmental,
economic, fiscal, and social equity effects in the host municipality, and may
adversely impact the overall region in which the warehouse is being proposed
for development.  Municipalities are often faced with a choice between the
development of housing, which results in a higher demand for schools and other
government services without an equivalent increase in property taxes, and
warehouse development, which may negatively impact the character of the
municipality, as well as affecting the farming areas, open space, recreation
areas, and areas of historic and cultural significance in the municipality. 
Frequently, this choice represents a Hobson's choice, with warehouse
development representing the only option that is fiscally viable for the
municipality.  Thus, it is the intent of this bill to offer municipalities a
program through which the municipality can purchase the development rights of a
proposed warehouse site, preserving the positive fiscal benefit of the real
property to the municipality, providing compensation to the landowner, and avoiding
the negative consequences associated with warehouse development.</p>
