AJR202 ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION No. 202 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED OCTOBER 21, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ROSAURA "ROSY" BAGOLIE District 27 (Essex and Passaic) Assemblywoman  ALIXON COLLAZOS-GILL District 27 (Essex and Passaic) Assemblywoman  VERLINA REYNOLDS-JACKSON District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Murphy SYNOPSIS Designates month of March of each year as Amyloidosis Awareness Month. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution permanently designating March as Amyloidosis Awareness Month in New Jersey. Whereas, Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins, known as amyloid fibrils, build up in tissue, organs, or nerves; and Whereas, Amyloid is produced when abnormal proteins in the body misfold and collect together in various tissues and organs.  As the amyloid builds up, it starts to cause organ damage and impair quality of life; and Whereas, There are approximately 36 different types of amyloidosis, each due to a specific protein misfolding.  These proteins can become irregular due to genetic effects, as well as through acquired environmental factors; and Whereas, The four most common types of systemic amyloidosis are light chain (AL), inflammation (AA), dialysis-related (Aβ2M), and hereditary and old age (ATTR and wild-type transthyretin amyloid); and Whereas, Signs and symptoms vary depending on the type of the amyloidosis, which organs have been affected, and the degree to which function has been impaired.  They may also develop slowly, resemble other, less serious illnesses, and vary from person to person who have the same type of amyloidosis; and Whereas, Some of the signs and symptoms of amyloidosis include, but are not limited to, severe fatigue and weakness, shortness of breath, numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet, swelling of the ankles and legs, diarrhea, an enlarged tongue, and skin changes, such as thickening of the skin or easy bruising; and Whereas, An early and precise diagnosis of amyloidosis is important because it can help prevent further organ damage.  However since amyloidosis mimics the signs and symptoms of more-common diseases, it is often difficult to diagnose; and Whereas, Although health care providers administer imaging, urine, or blood tests, to diagnose amyloidosis, a tissue biopsy of the organ or organs affected by the disease is the most accurate way to confirm a diagnosis; and Whereas, There is no cure for amyloidosis.  Treatment for the disease varies greatly depending on a patients specific condition, and is provided to manage symptoms experienced by a patient and limit further production of amyloid protein; and Whereas, Treatment options involve the use of various heart medications, if the amyloidosis patient presents with cardiovascular symptoms, chemotherapy and other targeted drug therapies, and surgical measures and other medical procedures, including, but not limited to, autologous blood stem cell transplants, organ transplants, and kidney dialysis; and Whereas, The life expectancy of an amyloidosis patient can vary significantly.  Some factors that may determine longevity are: the type of amyloidosis; the patients age at diagnosis; the stage of disease or how far along the disease has progressed; which organs are effected; comorbid illness; and other health-related issues; and Whereas, Because it is difficult to diagnose, many individuals with amyloidosis go undiagnosed every year and, if left untreated, the medial length of survival for such individuals is less than three years; and Whereas, By annually honoring Amyloidosis Awareness Month, the State of New Jersey will educate the public about the signs and symptoms of amyloidosis, extend the life expectancy of those who may be unaware that they are suffering from the disease, and improve the quality of life of those who have been diagnosed with the amyloidosis; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The month of March of each year is designated as Amyloidosis Awareness Month in the State of New Jersey in order to educate the public about the signs and symptoms of amyloidosis, extend the life expectancy of those who may be unaware that they are suffering from the disease, and help improve the quality of life of those who have been diagnosed with amyloidosis. 2.  The Governor is requested to annually issue a proclamation calling upon public officials and the citizens of this State to observe Amyloidosis Awareness Month with appropriate activities and programs. 3.  This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution designates the month of March as Amyloidosis Awareness Month in the State of New Jersey in order to educate the public about the signs and symptoms of amyloidosis, extend the life expectancy of those who may be unaware that they are suffering from the disease, and help improve the quality of life of those who have been diagnosed with the amyloidosis.
