Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    N.J.S.18A:71B-40 is
amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     18A:71B-40.  a.     The
authority shall select an investment manager or managers to invest the funds of
the trust or the funds in accounts.  In making this selection, any investment
manager shall be subject to the &quot;prudent person&quot; standard of care
applicable to the Division of Investment in the Department of the Treasury
pursuant to subsection b. of section 11 of P.L.1950, c.270 (C.52:18A-89), and
the authority shall <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>consider
the impact of<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>select a manager or managers that charge the lowest possible</u> fees and
costs imposed by the manager or managers on yield to contributors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The authority may select
more than one investment manager and investment instrument for the program if
it is in the best interest of contributors and will not interfere with the
administration of the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The authority may
provide a contributor with a choice of investment managers or investment
instruments or both for the program if both of the following conditions exist:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the federal Internal
Revenue Service has provided guidance that providing a contributor with a
choice of investment managers or instruments under a State tuition program will
not cause the program to fail to qualify for favorable tax treatment under
section 529 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C.s.529; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the authority concludes
that a choice of investment managers or of investment instruments is in the
best interest of contributors and will not interfere with the administration of
the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.     If the authority
terminates the designation of an investment manager to hold accounts, and
accounts must be moved from that investment manager to another investment
manager, the authority shall select the investment manager and type of
investment instrument to which the balance of the account is moved, unless the
federal Internal Revenue Service provides guidance that allowing the
contributor to select among several investment managers or investment
instruments that have been selected by the authority would not cause a program
to cease to be a qualified State tuition program for the purposes of section
529 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.s.529.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     If the selection
process provided for in this section results in an investment manager other
than the Division of Investment, the authority shall provide for the orderly
transfer of accounts and shall ensure that all the rights of the contributors
and designated beneficiaries participating in the program as of the effective
date of P.L.2001, c.262 (C.18A:71B-64 et al.), are protected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes improvements
to the New Jersey Better Education and Savings Trust (NJBEST) program to assist
accountholders in saving for a college education.  The Higher Education Student
Assistance Authority, in selecting an investment manager for NJBEST accounts,
would be required to select the investment manager that charges the lowest
possible fees and costs imposed by the manager or managers on yield to
contributors.  State law currently requires the authority to, among other
criteria, consider the impact of fees and costs imposed by the manager on yield
to contributors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The minimum dollar amount held
in an NJBEST account that is required to be excluded when evaluating the
financial needs of a student would also be raised from $25,000 to $50,000.  Under
current law, the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority determines a
dollar amount of an NJBEST account that: (1) is not permitted to be considered
in evaluating the financial need of a student beneficiary enrolled in an
institution of higher education located in the State or be deemed a financial
resource or form of financial aid for purposes of determining the student
beneficiarys eligibility for any State scholarship or grant; and (2) may not
be used to reduce the amount of any scholarship, grant, or monetary assistance
awarded by the State to which the student beneficiary is entitled.  The
authority may not set this dollar amount at less than $25,000.  This bill would
increase the amount to $50,000, thereby authorizing the exclusion of a greater
amount of a NJBEST account from consideration in evaluating the student
beneficiarys financial need for purposes of determining eligibility for any
scholarship, grant or monetary assistance awarded by the State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The current income limitation
for taxpayers who wish to deduct contributions made to an NJBEST account would
be raised to $300,000 and permit a deduction of up to $15,000 in contributions
from the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year.  Under current law,
taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 or less may only deduct up to $10,000 in
contributions made during the taxable year.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Taxpayers with an annual gross
income of $150,000 or less who frequently deposit into their NJBEST accounts
would be eligible for grants of at least 10 percent of the initial deposit into
the account up to $1,000 and for an additional grant of at least $100 for each
year the taxpayer is enrolled in an automated investment plan except for the
year in which the initial deposit is made.  Currently, NJBEST accounts opened
by taxpayers with gross incomes of $75,000 or less is only eligible for a
one-time grant of up to $750 in a dollar-for-dollar match of the initial
deposit into the account.  In addition, taxpayers with a gross income of
$150,000 or less would be eligible for a one-time grant of up to $500 in a
dollar-for-dollar match of the initial deposit into an NJBEST account provided
that the funds used for the initial deposit originate from an out-of-state
account established pursuant to section 529 of the federal Internal Revenue
Code.  Grant funds received by the taxpayer would not be subject to State
income taxes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also creates the New
Jersey Better Education Savings and Trust (NJBEST) Advisory Council within the
Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA).  The advisory council

and reporting the extent to which the NJBEST program has made a college
education accessible and affordable to families across the State; and support
existing, and recommending new, Statewide initiatives encouraging families to
save for a college education by opening an NJBEST account.  The advisory

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides tax
credits against taxes otherwise due under the State corporate business tax and
the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act for employers that make matching
contributions to the NJBEST accounts of employees.  Employers would be allowed
a tax credit for the total amount of matching contributions made by the
taxpayer to the NJBEST accounts of employees during the taxable year.  To
qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer would report the names, addresses, and
account numbers of the NJBEST accountholders employed by the taxpayer who
received matching contributions during the taxable year and the amount of the
contributions made to employee accounts. </p>
