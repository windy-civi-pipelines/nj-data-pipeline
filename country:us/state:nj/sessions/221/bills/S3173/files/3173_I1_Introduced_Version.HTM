<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Authorized representative
means a group home residents court-appointed guardian of the person or, if
there is no guardian of the person, the person who holds a valid power of attorney
or is otherwise legally authorized to act as the representative of the group
home resident for the purposes of making decisions related to the residents
care and living arrangements.  Authorized representative does not include a
caregiver or any other person who is employed or contracted, on a paid or
unpaid basis, by the group home licensee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Common areas means the
living areas, dining areas, entrances, outdoor areas, stairwells, and any other
areas within a group home, except bathrooms, which are commonly and communally
accessible to all residents, and are not dedicated for private use by a
particular resident.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Division means the Division
of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Electronic monitoring device
means a camera or other electronic device that uses video, but not audio,
recording capabilities to monitor the activities taking place in the area where
the device is installed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Group home means a living
arrangement that is licensed by the division and is operated in a residence or
residences leased or owned by a licensee; which living arrangement either
provides the opportunity for multiple adults with developmental disabilities to
live together in a home, sharing in chores and the overall management of the
residence, or provides the opportunity for a single adult with developmental
disabilities and extreme behavioral difficulties to live more independently
while receiving full-time care, and in which on-site staff provides
supervision, training, or assistance, in a variety of forms and intensity, as
required to assist the individual or individuals as they move toward
independence.  Group home does not include a living arrangement that is
dedicated for use by children with developmental disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Licensee means an
individual, partnership, or corporation that is licensed by the division, and
is responsible for providing services associated with the operation of a group
home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Resident means an individual
with developmental disabilities, residing in a group home, who is eligible to receive
Individuals Supports Services - Tier C and Beyond provided by the Division of Developmental
Disabilities in the Department of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  A group home for
individuals with developmental disabilities receiving Individuals Supports
Services - Tier C and Beyond provided by the Division of Developmental
Disabilities in the Department of Human Services that does not have electronic
monitoring devices already installed in the group homes common areas shall be
required to install electronic monitoring devices in those common areas, upon
the collective request of the residents and the residents authorized
representatives, if all of the residents of the group home and their authorized
representatives agree to have such electronic monitoring devices installed and
expressly consent to the installation and use of such devices.  A licensee
shall not require current residents to consent to the installation and use of
electronic monitoring devices in the common areas as a condition of their
continued residency in the group home.  Each licensee operating a group home
that does not have electronic monitoring devices already installed in the
common areas shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) within six months after
the group home adopts an internal electronic monitoring policy pursuant to
section 3 of this act, take affirmative action to determine whether the
residents of the group home and their authorized representatives want and
consent to have electronic monitoring devices installed and used in the group
homes common areas pursuant to this section; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) ensure that all new
residents or their authorized representatives express written consent to the
use of the electronic monitoring devices in the group homes common areas prior
to their residency in the group home; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) annually provide written
notice to all residents and their authorized representatives informing them of
their right to request the installation and use of electronic monitoring
devices in the group homes common areas, as provided by this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  A group home that installs
and uses electronic monitoring devices in its common areas pursuant to the
agreement, request, and consent of the residents, as provided by this section,
shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) require each person
employed by the group home to provide express written consent to the use of the
electronic monitoring devices in the group homes common areas, as a condition
of the persons employment; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) ensure that a prominent
written notice is posted at the entrance and exit doors to the home informing
visitors that they will be subject to electronic video monitoring while present
in the home; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) ensure that the group home
allows those individuals who consent to the ongoing use of electronic
monitoring devices in the group homes common areas or their authorized
representatives to change their minds and withdraw their consent to the use of
electronic devices in a group homes common areas at any time after expressing
written consent to the use of such electronic monitoring devices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  An individuals refusal to
agree and consent to the use of electronic monitoring devices in a group homes
common areas or the withdrawal of their agreement and consent pursuant to
paragraph (3) of subsection b. of this section shall not be used as a basis to
prevent the timely placement of the individual in appropriate housing without
surveillance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  (1) Any electronic
monitoring devices installed pursuant to this section shall be unobstructed and
recording at all times, and any recordings produced by the devices shall be
retained by the program for a period of 90 days.  Each licensee shall inspect
the devices, and shall document the results of each inspection, on a weekly
basis.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) A resident or the
residents authorized representative shall be authorized, upon request
