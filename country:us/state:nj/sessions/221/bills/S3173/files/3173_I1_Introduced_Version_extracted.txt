(2)  Within 180 days after the publication of guidelines pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, each licensee shall develop and submit to the division a written internal policy specifying the procedures and protocols that are to be used by facility staff when installing and utilizing electronic monitoring devices as provided by this act. b.  An internal electronic monitoring policy established pursuant to this section shall: (1) describe the procedures and protocols that are to be used when obtaining consent from residents and facility staff for the use of electronic monitoring devices in a group homes common areas, as provided by section 2 of this act; and (2) describe the procedures and protocols that are to be used when a resident or the residents authorized representative express, in writing, their wish to withdraw their consent for the use of electronic monitoring devices in a group homes common areas, as provided by section 2;

shall not be required to remove the devices from service; and shall not be required to comply with the provisions of this act in order to continue utilizing the previously-installed devices.  However, to the extent that a group homes common areas do not contain electronic monitoring devices on the effective date of this act, the licensee shall comply with the provisions of section 2 of this act, as applicable, when installing and utilizing new electronic monitoring devices in such unmonitored areas. 6.  a.  Any licensee that fails to comply with the provisions of this act shall be subject to a penalty of $5,000 for the first offense, and a penalty of $10,000 for the second or subsequent offense, to be collected with costs in a summary proceeding, pursuant to the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), as well as an appropriate administrative penalty, the amount of which shall be determined by the division. b.  A group home licensee shall not be subject to penalties under this section, or to any other disciplinary action, for failing to comply with the requirements of section 2 of this act, as applicable, if the group home licensee establishes, through documentation or otherwise, that electronic monitoring devices were installed and being utilized in the group homes common areas, as of the effective date of this act, as provided by section 5 of this act, and that the group home is, therefore, exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 2 of this act, as appropriate. 7.  a.  The Commissioner of Human Services, in consultation with the assistant commissioner of the division, shall: (1)  annually prepare and submit to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1 et seq.), to the Legislature, a written report describing how this act has been implemented in the State.  Each annual report shall include, at a minimum: (a) a list of group homes that are currently using electronic monitoring devices in the common areas; (b) a list of group homes that have not installed electronic monitoring devices in the common areas; (c) to the extent known, a list of group homes that have failed to install and use electronic monitoring devices in the common areas upon the request of the residents, as provided by section 2 of this act, despite the licensees receipt of uniform resident consent authorizing such monitoring, and an indication of the penalties that were imposed under section 6 of this act in response to such failures; (d) a list of group homes that are exempt from compliance with the provisions of section 2 of this act, as provided by section 6 of this act; and (e) recommendations for legislative, executive, or other action that can be taken to improve compliance with the acts provisions, or to otherwise expand the consensual use of electronic monitoring devices in group homes; and (f) post, at a publicly accessible location on its Internet website, the various lists of group homes produced under paragraph (1) of this subsection, and annually update the website to ensure that each list contains the most current data reported pursuant to this subsection.  Each list posted online shall be searchable by location and by name of group home. b.  Within five years after the effective date of this act, the division shall prepare and submit to the Governor, and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature, a written report that: (1) identifies best practices for the installation and use of electronic monitoring devices under this act; (2) identifies best practices and provides recommendations regarding the obtaining of informed consent for electronic monitoring, as provided by this act; and (3) provides recommendations for the implementation of new legislation, policies, protocols, and procedures related to the use of electronic monitoring devices in group homes. c.  The Ombudsman for Individuals with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities and Their Families shall include, in each of the ombudsmans annual reports prepared pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2017, c.269 (C.30:1AA-9.3), a section evaluating the implementation of this act and providing recommendations for improvement. 8.  The Commissioner of Human Services, in consultation with the assistant commissioner of the division, shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this act. 9.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill provides certain requirements in association with the use of electronic monitoring devices (EMDs) at group homes for individuals with developmental disabilities who are eligible to receive Individuals Supports Services - Tier C and Beyond provided by the Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) in the Department of Human Services (DHS).  An EMD is a camera or other electronic device that uses video, but not audio, recording capabilities to monitor the activities taking place in the area where the device is installed. Specifically, the bill would allow group home residents or their authorized representatives to decide whether to allow for the installation and use of EMDs in the common areas of the group homes. The bill would require group homes, as defined in the bill, to install EMDs in the common areas, upon the agreement, request, and uniform consent of all residents. The DDD would be authorized to impose any additional consent, consent declination, or withdrawal of consent requirements as necessary. The bill includes a provision that grandfathers-in and exempts from the bills provisions group homes that have already installed, and are utilizing, EMDs as of the bills effective date. If a group homes common areas do not contain EMDs on the bills effective date, the licensee will be required to comply with the bill when installing new EMDs in unmonitored areas. Any recordings produced by an EMD in a group homes common areas and any consent forms, consent declination forms, withdrawal of consent, and notice of intent forms submitted under the bill are to be retained by the group home for a period of time to be determined by the DDD. Within 180 days after the bills effective date, each group home will be required to develop and submit to the division a written internal policy specifying the procedures and protocols that are to be used by program staff when installing and utilizing EMDs. Any residential program that fails to comply with the bills requirements will be subject to a financial penalty and an appropriate administrative penalty, in an amount to be determined by the DHS. The Commissioner of Human Services, in consultation with the assistant commissioner of the DDD, is to annually report to the Governor and Legislature on the implementation of the bills provisions. The bill further requires the DDD, within five years of the bills effective date, to provide the Governor and Legislature with a written report that identifies best practices for, and provides recommendations regarding the implementation of new legislation, policies, protocols, and procedures related to, the use of EMDs in group homes.
