<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides a tax credit
under the corporation business tax and the gross income tax for certain costs <span
style='color:black'>associated with the demolition of an abandoned commercial
building and the construction of a new commercial building in its place.  As
defined by the bill, commercial building means a building of at least 100,000
square feet that is used for commercial purposes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     Specifically,
the bill allows a taxpayer </span>who replaces an abandoned commercial building
in the State by demolishing the abandoned commercial building and constructing
a new commercial building in the same location to receive a corporation
business tax credit and gross income tax credit.<span style='color:black'>  The
amount of the tax credits provided by the bill may not exceed the lesser of:
(1) </span>25 percent of the total costs incurred by the taxpayer associated
with the <span style='color:black'>demolition of the abandoned commercial
building and the construction of the new commercial building</span>, or (2)
$500,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To qualify for a tax credit
allowed under the bill, a taxpayer would be required to apply to the Division
of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury (division) for a certification
that provides:  (1) that the demolition of the abandoned commercial building
and the construction of the new commercial building meet the requirements of
the bill; and (2) the amount of the tax credit.  The application would be
required to demonstrate that the abandoned commercial building was demolished, and
that a new commercial building was constructed in its place, prior to applying
for the tax credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black'>The
bill requires the division to adopt rules and regulations as are necessary to
implement the bills provisions.  The bill would also limit the cumulative
total of tax credits awarded pursuant to the bill to $5 million.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would
require, no later than one year after the expiration of the tax credits
provided pursuant to the bill, the division to prepare and submit to the
Governor, the State Treasurer, and the Legislature a report that, at a minimum,
summarizes the effectiveness of the tax credit in incentivizing the replacement
of abandoned commercial buildings with newly constructed commercial buildings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Construction of commercial
buildings throughout the State has increased exponentially during recent
years.  Many commercial buildings have been constructed on the States
farmland, which has adversely impacted the States farming sector. 
Construction of commercial buildings on farmland decreases the amount of land
in the State that is able to be used for farming purposes and, in many cases,
destroys prime soil, which is limited to areas where the soil naturally occurs
and, once destroyed, cannot be recreated.  Farmland is an important economic
and environmental resource for New Jersey and, for this reason, it is important
take steps to ensure farmland is used for farming purposes and not converted
into commercial buildings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lands currently used for
commercial purposes should continue to be used for commercial purposes.  For
this reason, abandoned commercial buildings should be replaced with newly
constructed commercial buildings at the same location.  This bill would encourage
the development of commercial buildings throughout the State while also
protecting the States farmland.</p>
