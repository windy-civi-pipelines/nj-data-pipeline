In addition, the bill upgrades the offense of knowingly producing, transmitting, or disseminating a false election advertisement that purports to be from a campaign for the purpose of impeding that campaign, by concealing the actual origin of the advertisement, from a disorderly persons offense to a crime of the third degree. A crime of the second degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of five to 10 years, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.  A crime of the third degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of 3 to 5 years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.
