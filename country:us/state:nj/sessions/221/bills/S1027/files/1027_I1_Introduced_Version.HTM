administer a program that makes one or more low-interest loans available to an
eligible small business for 100 percent of any otherwise unreimbursed costs to
the small business of: (1) an energy audit of any of the small businesss
buildings conducted by a contractor licensed by the board; and (2) the purchase

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Energy audit means an
on-site analysis or assessment of all the energy-using systems within a
building to determine the energy consumption characteristics of that building
for the purpose of identifying appropriate energy efficiency or conservation

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Low-interest loan means a
