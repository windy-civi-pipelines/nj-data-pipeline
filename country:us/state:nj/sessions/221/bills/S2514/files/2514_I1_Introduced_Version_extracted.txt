Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  Notwithstanding the provision of any law or regulation to the contrary, no asset of a pension, annuity, or other retirement fund administered by the State shall be invested in a debt or equity instrument of a corporation that lowers its annual worldwide effective income tax rate by 1/5 or more within three years predominately due to a shift in ownership or operations outside the United States of America. b.    The State Investment Council and the Director of the Division of Investment in the Department of the Treasury shall sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw any investment held in violation of subsection a. of this section within three years of the date of enactment of this section. c.     (1)  No later than sixty days after the date of enactment of this section, the Director of the Division of Investment shall file with the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1),  a  report detailing all investments held as of the date of enactment of this section that violate subsection a. of this section. (2) Until the date that all assets held in violation of subsection a. of this section are no longer held pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the Director of the Division of Investment shall file with the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), an annual report detailing all investments held in violation of subsection a. of this section.

STATEMENT This bill prohibits State administered pension fund investment in corporations shifting ownership or operations outside the U.S. for tax purposes (i.e. corporate inversion tactics).  The purpose of this bill is to prevent the States pension fund investment from supporting the domestic income generation activities of corporations willing to flee the U.S. to avoid tax liability. The bill prohibits the investment of State administered pension funds into a corporation shifting ownership or operations outside the U.S. if that shift lowers the corporations effective income tax rate by 20% or more within a three-year-period.  The bill requires the State to dispose of all investments held in violation of this prohibition within three years of the date of enactment. The bill also includes two reporting requirements: (i)    an initial report detailing the current investments in corporations using inversion tactics that is due within 60 days of the date of enactment; and (ii)   an annual report detailing the progress made in disposing of investments in corporations using inversion tactics. The annual reporting requirement expires upon the complete disposal of investment in corporations using inversion tactics.
