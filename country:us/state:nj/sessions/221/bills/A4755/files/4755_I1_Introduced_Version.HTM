<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 7 of P.L.1981,
c.167 (C.2C:20-7.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.    Fencing. a. Possession
of altered property.  Any dealer in property who knew or should have known that
the identifying features such as serial numbers and permanently affixed labels
of property in his possession have been removed or altered without the consent
of the manufacturer is guilty of possession of altered property.  It is a
defense to a prosecution under this subsection that a person lawfully possesses
the usual indicia of ownership in addition to mere possession.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) Dealing in stolen
property.  A person is guilty of dealing in stolen property if he traffics in,
or initiates, organizes, plans, finances, directs, manages or supervises
trafficing in stolen property<u>, including through the use of an online
platform via any electronic device or through a social media site</u>.  This
paragraph shall not apply to dealing in stolen property consisting of a
domestic companion animal, addressed in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Dealing in stolen
domestic companion animals.  A person is guilty of dealing in stolen domestic
companion animals if he trafficks in, or initiates, organizes, plans, finances,
directs, manages or supervises trafficking in stolen property consisting of a
domestic companion animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c. (1) For any violation of
this section, other than dealing in stolen domestic companion animals, the value
of the property involved in the violation shall be determined by the trier of
fact for the purpose of determining the grade of the offense, and the value of
the property involved in the violation may be aggregated in determining the
grade of the offense where the acts or conduct constituting a violation were
committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether from the same
person or several persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A violation of this
section for dealing in stolen domestic companion animals constitutes a crime of
the third degree.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    It is an affirmative
defense to a prosecution under this section that the actor:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Was unaware that the
property or service was that of another;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Acted under an honest
claim of right to the property or service involved or that he had a right to
acquire or dispose of it as he did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In addition to the
presumptions contained in subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:20-7, the following
presumptions are available in the prosecution for a fencing offense:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Proof of the purchase or
sale of property at a price substantially below its fair market value, unless
satisfactorily explained, gives rise to an inference that the person buying or
selling the property knew that it had been stolen;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Proof of the purchase or
sale of property by a dealer in that property, out of the regular course of
business, or without the usual indicia of ownership other than mere possession,
or the property or the job lot of which it is a part was bought, received,
possessed or controlled in broken succession of title, so that it cannot be
traced, by appropriate documents, in unbroken succession to the manufacturer,
in all cases where the regular course of business reasonably indicates records
of purchase, transfer or sale, unless satisfactorily explained, gives rise to
an inference that the person buying or selling the property knew that it had
been stolen; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Proof that a person
buying or selling property of the sort received obtained such property without
having ascertained by reasonable inquiry that the person from whom he obtained
it had a legal right to possess or control it gives rise to an inference that
such person knew that it had been stolen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2017, c.156, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  a.  A
person is guilty of fostering the sale of stolen property, a disorderly persons
offense, if the person:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   hosts, advertises, or
otherwise assists in the sale of stolen goods, including through an online platform;
and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) knows or reasonably should
know that the property was stolen.  The requisite knowledge is presumed in the
case of a person who undertook a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the
persons actions would result in the sale of stolen property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    As defined in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Online platform means any
public-facing Internet website, Internet web application, or computer or mobile
application, including a social networking website or publication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Sale means any sale,
transfer, exchange, barter, or offer for sale and distribution, in any manner
or by any means whatsoever, including, but not limited to, via an online
platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Stolen property shall have
