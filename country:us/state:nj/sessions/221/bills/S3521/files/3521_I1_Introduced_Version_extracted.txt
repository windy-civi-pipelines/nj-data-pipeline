STATEMENT This bill requires employers to provide any employee who serves as a State or local volunteer first responder in this State with one additional paid sick day per benefit year to use for healthcare diagnostic testing to prevent or diagnose any condition that may relate to the employee's duties as a volunteer first responder.  Under the bill, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, in consultation as necessary with other State agencies, is required to adopt rules and regulations to implement the bills provisions. The sponsor notes that there is growing concern across the State that volunteer emergency services organizations are unable to recruit an adequate number of volunteer first responders to meet the community's needs.  Volunteer first responders are crucial for maintaining the safety and well-being of the community.  When fewer people volunteer, municipalities are forced to hire paid personnel at the taxpayers' expense.  The sponsor believes that ensuring that volunteer first responders, who may have been exposed to hazardous conditions as a consequence of their volunteer service, have adequate time to undergo any recommended healthcare diagnostic testing will encourage volunteer recruitment and retention by allowing the volunteers to serve the community while meeting the responsibilities of the volunteers paid employment.
