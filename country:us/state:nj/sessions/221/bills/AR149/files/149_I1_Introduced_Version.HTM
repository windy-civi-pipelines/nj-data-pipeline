Addressing Members of the General Assembly All members of the General Assembly shall be addressed, and referred to, as State Representative. 2.    This resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution supplements the General Assembly Rules to require that all members of the General Assembly be addressed as State Representative.  State Representative is a gender-neutral term that provides all members of the General Assembly with the same title. Currently, members of the General Assembly are referred to as Assemblyman and Assemblywoman. The New Jersey State Constitution of 1947 refers to persons elected to the General Assembly as members, not as Assemblyman or Assemblywoman.  45 states and territories use the term representative for members of the lower body.  While other states and territories have other genderless titles for members of their lower house, only New Jersey, New York, Nevada, and California call their members Assemblyman and Assemblywoman.  New Jersey would be joining the large majority of states by choosing a genderless title for its General Assembly members.
