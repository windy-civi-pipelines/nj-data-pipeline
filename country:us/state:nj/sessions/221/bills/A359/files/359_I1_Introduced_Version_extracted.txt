If, as a result of such reapportionment, a disproportionate number of the total representatives of any one constituent district to a regional board are to be elected at a single annual school election, the commissioner shall have the power, on petition of a constituent district board of education, to alter the term of any member representing such constituent district by not more than one year, so as to temporarily apportion, as equally as possible over any given three-year period, the election of the members representing such constituent district. (cf: P.L.2017, c.45, s.2) 9.    Section 1 of P.L.1970, c.305 (C.18A:13-9.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    Whenever the board of education of a regional district shall, following the  taking of a Federal decennial census and the issuance of preliminary populations of the constituent districts pursuant to said census but prior to the issuance of the final populations of said districts and the [official promulgation] receipt by the Governor of said census in this State, determine that (a) said final populations and [official promulgation] receipt by the Governor of the census shall not be available in time for the next succeeding election of members of said board, (b) said preliminary figures  indicate that significant changes in the number of members to be allocated to  the constituent districts will result, and (c) the allocation of members among  the constituent districts on the basis of the present official census effective  in this State will result in inequitable representation, it may, by resolution  unanimously adopted and approved by the Commissioner of Education, provide  that, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, the  members to be next elected pursuant to article 7 of chapter 13 of Title 18A of  the New Jersey Statutes shall be elected at a special election to be held on a  day no later than 60 days after the [official promulgation] receipt by the Governor of said census in  this State as specified in said resolution. (cf: P.L.1970, c.305, s.1) 10.     Section 3 of P.L.1990, c.85 (C.52:27D-386) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in this act, "qualifying municipality" means a municipality which: a.     does not receive aid under P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178 et seq.); b.    has a population density that exceeds six times the State population density, according to the most recent State population and area estimates reported by the New Jersey Department of Labor, Division of Labor Market and Demographic Research, except that in the year of [promulgation] receipt by the Governor of a federal decennial census, the census figures shall be used; c.     has a population that exceeds 7,500 residents; and d.    is located in any of the five most densely populated counties, according to the most recent State population estimates reported by the New Jersey Department of Labor, Division of Labor Market and Demographic Research, except that in the year of [promulgation] receipt by the Governor of a federal decennial census, the census figures shall be used. (cf: P.L.1990, c.85, s.3) 11.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall be retroactive to July 1, 2021. STATEMENT This bill removes the requirement for promulgation by the Governor of the national census. Under current law, the governor is authorized to file in the office of the Secretary of State a copy of the bulletin issued by the director of the national census.  The filing is an official promulgation of the census. This bill removes that requirement. The director of the national census no longer issues a bulletin regarding the census.  The information is now available online directly from the Census Bureau and has already been published online by the Secretary of State.  Thus, the Governor has already made this information available and the promulgation requirement is no longer necessary.  This bill authorizes the Governor to issue a statement declaring the date on which the census was received.  The bill also states that whenever in any statute or regulation reference is made to promulgation of the federal decennial census, the same will mean and refer to the receipt by the Governor of the official federal decennial census.
