(2)  The separate form shall include two checkoff boxes as described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection for each individual included in the tax return and the information described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection a. and in subsection b. of this section.

(4)  One checkoff box shall allow an individual who files a tax return the choice to not have the department make the determination described in paragraph (3) of this subsection for the individual filing the tax return and any other individual included in that tax return who does not have minimum essential coverage. (5)  The State Treasurer, in consultation with the Department of Banking and Insurance, shall: (a)  develop language for the checkoff boxes described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection; (b)  develop language for the instructions for the State income tax return that includes a description of the effects of choosing the checkoff boxes described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, including the purposes for which the information disclosed under this section may be used; and (c)  ensure that the language developed under subparagraph (a) of this paragraph is as simple, clear, and easy to understand as possible. (6)  If an individual who files a tax return makes the election described in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the State Treasurer shall convey to the department all eligibility-relevant information contained on the return for all individuals included in that tax return. d.    [The State Treasurer shall waive the State shared responsibility tax imposed pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2018, c.31 (C.54A:11-3) applicable to months of the year that the tax return is filed for any taxpayer who chooses the checkoff box described in paragraph (3) of subsection c. of this section.  If the taxpayer fails to enroll in minimum essential coverage and maintain that coverage in each month following the enrollment period, the taxpayer shall be liable for any payments to which the taxpayer would have otherwise been subject.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). e.     [The State Treasurer shall coordinate the requirements of this subsection with the requirements of the "New Jersey Health Insurance Market Preservation Act," P.L.2018, c.31 (C.54A:11-1 et seq.)] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2022, c.39, s.6) 5.    P.L.2018, c.31 (C.54A:11-1 through C.54A:11-10) is repealed. 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill repeals the New Jersey Health Insurance Market Preservation Act which requires most individuals, other than those who qualify for certain exemptions, to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty.  Existing law requires every resident taxpayer of the State to obtain health insurance coverage that qualifies as minimum essential coverage.  This bill repeals that requirement. In addition, the bill removes a provision of existing law funding the New Jersey Health Insurance Premium Security Fund, in part, from the penalties collected from those who do not meet the States minimum essential coverage requirement.
