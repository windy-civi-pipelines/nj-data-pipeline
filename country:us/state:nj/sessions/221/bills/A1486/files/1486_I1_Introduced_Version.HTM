(cf: P.L.2022, c.69, s.1) 2.    Section 2 of P.L.1976, c.16 (C.19:23-45.1) is amended to read as follows: 2. a. The county commissioner of registration in each of the several counties shall cause a notice to be published in each municipality of their respective counties in a newspaper or newspapers circulating therein.  The notice to be so published shall be published once during each of the two calendar weeks next preceding the week in which the 55th day next preceding the primary election of a political party occurs. b. (1) The notice required to be published by the preceding paragraph shall inform the reader thereof that: (a) no voter, except a newly registered voter at the first primary at which the voter is eligible to vote, or a voter who has not previously voted in a primary election may vote in a primary election of a political party unless the voter was deemed to be a member of that party on the 55th day next preceding such primary election; (b) a voter who is listed to receive mail-in ballots for all future elections, pursuant to the provisions of section 3 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-3) or section 14 of P.L.2018, c.72 (C.19:63-3.1), and who is not affiliated with any political party shall not receive a mail-in ballot for a primary election.  Such unaffiliated mail-in voters shall receive a political party affiliation declaration form and information concerning how to affiliate with a political party, how to vote by mail in the primary election, and how to vote in person at a polling place on the day of a primary election.  Such an unaffiliated mail-in voter, who is not affiliated with any political party, may vote using a mail-in ballot in a primary election if the voter submits a political party affiliation declaration form to the municipal clerk or the county commissioner of registration and requests a mail-in ballot prior to the deadline in which a voter may apply in person to the county clerk for a mail-in ballot, pursuant to subsection d. of section 3 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-3); and (c) a voter who votes in the primary election of a political party, or who signs and files with the municipal clerk or the county commissioner of registration a declaration that the voter desires to vote in the primary election of a political party, or who indicates on a voter registration form the voter's choice of political party affiliation and submits the form to the commissioner of registration of the county wherein the voter resides, to the employees or agents of a public agency, as defined in subsection a. of section 15 of P.L.1974, c.30 (C.19:31-6.3), or a voter registration agency, as defined in subsection a. of section 26 of P.L.1994, c.182 (C.19:31-6.11) or to the Secretary of State, either on a paper form or an electronic form using the online voter registration system established under section 1 of P.L.2019, c.382 (C.19:31-6.4c), shall be deemed to be a member of that party until the voter signs and files with the municipal clerk or the commissioner of registration a declaration that the voter desires to vote in the primary election of another political party, at which time the voter shall be deemed to be a member of such other political party, or that the voter chooses not to be affiliated with any political party. (2) The notice shall also state the time and location where a person may obtain political party affiliation declaration forms or voter registration forms. (cf: P.L.2022, c.69, s.2) 3. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows an unaffiliated mail-in voter to vote using the mail-in ballot in a primary election if the voter submits a political party affiliation declaration form to the municipal clerk or the county commissioner of registration by 3 p.m. the day before the primary election, and requests the mail-in ballot by that deadline from the county clerk. Under current law, a voter is required to be deemed a member of a political party by the 55th day prior to a primary election in order to vote in a primary election of that political party.  However, unaffiliated voters, meaning voters who are not affiliated with any political party, are permitted to vote in person on primary election day and thereby affiliate with a political party by voting that day, while unaffiliated mail-in voters receive a political party affiliation declaration form and information concerning how to affiliate with a political party and how to vote in person at a polling place on the day of a primary election.
