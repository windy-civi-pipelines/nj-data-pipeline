that they must maintain as they receive for each mile of road that they must
maintain. </p>

Commissioner of Transportation (commissioner) to provide no less than $4
million per year in grants from the Local Aid Infrastructure Fund for boardwalk
projects in State Fiscal Years 2022 through 2031.  The Local Aid Infrastructure
Fund is a discretionary grant pool that the commissioner may award to projects
not covered by the other local aid program categories.  </p>
