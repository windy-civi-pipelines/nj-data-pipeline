The bill also amends the Local Budget Law, N.J.S.40A:4-1 et seq., to permit a local government unit to adopt a special emergency appropriation for the purchase, planting, and removal of trees and shrubbery following a natural disaster.  This authorization would allow the local government unit to issue special emergency notes to defray the costs of these expenses.  Under current law, special emergency notes are required to mature no later than five years after the issuance.
