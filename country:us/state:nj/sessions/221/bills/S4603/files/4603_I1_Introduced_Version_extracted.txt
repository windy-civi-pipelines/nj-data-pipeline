SCUTARI District 22 (Somerset and Union) SYNOPSIS Establishes requirements to develop protocols and training for reunification therapy; makes appropriation. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the development and oversight of reunification therapy services and supplementing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Children are sometimes estranged from their parents for a variety of reasons, including parental divorce and subsequent custodial conflict, substance abuse, criminal activity in the home, incarceration of a parent, or a history of abuse by a parent. b.    These cases may require involvement of the New Jersey Department of Children and Families as well as family courts. c.     When appropriate, a court may order reunification of a child with an estranged parent and recommend the use of therapy services by a licensed mental health professional. d.    Similarly, if a child is referred into the Childrens System of Care in the Department of Children and Families, a licensed mental health professional in the childrens system of care may begin reunification therapy. e.     Due to the complexity of the therapeutic intervention, mental health professionals must possess specific training and experience to appropriately provide reunification therapy. f.     Even when a licensed therapist holds training in family reunification, the therapist may not possess all the necessary verified knowledge, skills, and experience to provide therapy services, identifying when reunification would be in the best interest of the child and when it is not, causing significant harm and additional trauma to the child. g.    Safe and successful reunification therapy requires that the providing therapist practice in a manner that is mindful of the specific nuances and complexities that necessitated the separation of a parent and a child. h.    A lack of appropriate training and certification programs providing instruction for reunification therapy creates an unacceptable risk of a negative impact on the mental health and welfare of children and families overall. 2.    As used in this act: Department means the Department of Children and Families. Reunification therapy means a form of therapy to rebuild or reestablish a connection between a parent and child after a distinct period of separation caused by various circumstances, including, but not limited to, incarceration; addiction and subsequent treatment; physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; or as a result of a divorce. State-licensed mental health professional means a professional who meets the prerequisites required to provide reunification therapy services and is licensed by the requisite board in New Jersey in one of the following specialties: alcohol and drug counseling;
