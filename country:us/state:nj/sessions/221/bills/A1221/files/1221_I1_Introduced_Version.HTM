allocated to the parcel pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and
the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto, the
committee shall determine the value of the development easement by:</p>

number of fair market value appraisals as it deems appropriate to determine the
value for farmland preservation purposes of the pinelands development credits;</p>

easement values in counties, municipalities, and other areas (a) reasonably
contiguous to, but outside of, the pinelands area, which in the sole opinion of
the committee constitute reasonable development easement values in the
pinelands area for the purposes of this subsection, and (b) in the pinelands
area where pinelands development credits are or may be utilized, which in the
sole opinion of the committee constitute reasonable development easement values
in the pinelands area for the purposes of this subsection;</p>

to increase participation in the farmland preservation program by owners of
agricultural lands located in the pinelands area.</p>

acquisition of a development easement on farmland or fee simple title to
farmland by the State, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt
nonprofit organization using constitutionally dedicated moneys in whole or in
part may be conveyed in any manner.  All such pinelands development credits
shall be retired permanently.</p>
