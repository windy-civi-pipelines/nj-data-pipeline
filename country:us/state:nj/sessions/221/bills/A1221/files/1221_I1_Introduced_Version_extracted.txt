(2)   In prioritizing applications for funding submitted by local government units in the Highlands planning area, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), to acquire development easements on farmland in the Highlands planning area using moneys from the Garden State Farmland Preservation Trust Fund, the committee shall accord a higher weight to any application submitted by a local government unit to preserve farmland in a municipality in the Highlands planning area that has amended its development regulations in accordance with section 13 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-13) to establish one or more receiving zones for the transfer of development potential from the Highlands preservation area, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), than that which is accorded to comparable applications submitted by other local government units to preserve farmland in municipalities in the Highlands planning area that have not made such amendments to their development regulations. m.   Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-1 et seq.) to the contrary, for State fiscal years 2005 through 2009, the sum spent by the committee in each of those fiscal years for the acquisition by the committee of development easements and fee simple titles to farmland for farmland preservation purposes using moneys from the Garden State Farmland Preservation Trust Fund in each county of the State shall be not less, and may be greater if additional sums become available, than the average annual sum spent by the department therefor in each such county, respectively, for State fiscal years 2002 through 2004, provided there is sufficient and appropriate farmland within the county to be so acquired by the committee for such purposes. (cf: P.L.2019, c.136, s.9) 2.  Section 8 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-50) is amended to read as follows: 8.  a.  The State Treasurer shall establish a fund to be known as the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund and shall deposit all moneys received pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-47), paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2019, c.136 (C.13:8C-47.1), and any other moneys appropriated by law for deposit into the fund. Moneys in the fund shall be invested in permitted investments or shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in those depositories as the State Treasurer may select, and may be invested and reinvested in permitted investments or as other trust funds in the custody of the State Treasurer in the manner provided by law.  All interest or other income or earnings derived from the investment or reinvestment of moneys in the fund shall be credited to the fund. b.  (1) The moneys in the fund are specifically dedicated and shall be used for the same purposes as those set forth in section 37 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-37) and as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection.

(3)   Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) to the contrary, stewardship activities undertaken on farmland on which (a) the pinelands development credits have been acquired pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.), and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto, or the development rights have been acquired pursuant to a transfer of development rights program for the Highlands Region established pursuant to section 13 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-13), and (b) there is deed restriction approved by the committee, shall be eligible for funding pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. c.     Moneys in the fund shall not be expended except in accordance with appropriations from the fund made by law.  Any act appropriating moneys from the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund shall identify any particular project or projects to be funded by the moneys, and any expenditure for a project for which the location is not identified by municipality and county in the appropriation shall require the approval of the Joint Budget Oversight Committee, or its successor, except as permitted otherwise in accordance with the same exceptions as those specified in paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 23 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-23). d.    Unexpended moneys due to project withdrawals, cancellations, or cost savings shall be returned to the fund. e.     Notwithstanding the provisions of section 24 of P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-31) or section 38 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-38), or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, to the contrary, when the committee, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization seeks to acquire a development easement on, or fee simple title to, farmland using, in whole or in part, monies deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund, the Garden State Farmland Preservation Trust Fund established pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-20), or any other State monies provided for farmland preservation purposes, the value of the development easement, or fee simple title, as applicable, shall be determined by the following: (1) the procedure set forth in section 24 of P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-31); (2) a value determined in accordance with a formula, to be known as the Statewide Farmland Preservation Formula, which formula is established by rule or regulation adopted by the committee, pursuant to subsection f. of this section, and includes: (a) conducting or analyzing a sufficient number of fair market value appraisals of agricultural lands within the municipality in which the land is located, or the surrounding market area, or both, as the committee deems appropriate to determine the value of the land for farmland preservation; (b) considering farmland and development easement values in counties and municipalities reasonably contiguous to, but outside of, the municipality in which the land to be acquired is located, which in the sole opinion of the committee constitute reasonable farmland and development easement values for the purposes of this subsection; (c) considering the importance of preserving agricultural lands in the municipality and county in which the land is located; (d) considering the status and value of natural resources in the municipality and county in which the land is located, and in counties and municipalities that are reasonably contiguous to, but outside of, the municipality and county in which the land is located; (e) considering such other relevant factors as may be necessary to increase participation in the farmland preservation program by owners of agricultural lands located in the municipality and county in which the land is located, including, but not limited to, the rate of inflation, the quality of the agricultural soils, the size of the agricultural lands to be acquired, and the risk of conversion of the land from productive agriculture to nonagricultural use; and (f) providing additional value for the proximity of agricultural lands located adjacent to preserved agricultural lands, lands preserved for recreation and conservation purposes, aquifer recharge areas, lands subject to development or conservation easements, and lands whose conversion to nonagricultural use would lead to conflicting land uses, including, but not limited to, utility and roadway rights-of-way, military bases, and airports and associated airspace; and, if applicable, (3) (a) in the case of property located in the pinelands area, whenever the value of a development easement on farmland to be acquired is determined based upon the value of any pinelands development credits allocated to the parcel pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto, the value determined by the committee pursuant to subsection e. of section 38 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-38); or (b) in the case of property located in the Highlands Region, the value determined pursuant to subsection j. of section 38 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-38). The landowner shall be provided with the values determined pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, and if applicable, the value determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.  The higher of the values shall be utilized by the committee, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization as the basis for negotiation with the landowner with respect to the acquisition price.  A landowner may waive any of the requirements of this subsection and may agree to sell the lands for less than the values determined pursuant to this subsection. f.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the committee shall, immediately upon filing proper notice with the Office of Administrative Law, adopt rules and regulations to establish the Statewide Farmland Preservation Formula required pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection e. of this section.  The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be in effect for a period not to exceed three years after the date of the filing.  These rules and regulations shall thereafter be adopted, amended, or readopted by the committee in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2019, c.136, s.4) 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would establish a new process for the determination of the value of farmland, and development easements on farmland, to be acquired for farmland preservation purposes by the State Agriculture Development Committee (SADC), a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization using, in whole or in part, constitutionally dedicated Corporation Business Tax monies deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund, the Garden State Farmland Preservation Trust Fund, or any other State monies provided for farmland preservation purposes. This process would be used in addition to the appraisal processes in current law. Under this bill, the committee would adopt a formula, to be known as the Statewide Farmland Preservation Formula, that includes: (1) conducting or analyzing a sufficient number of fair market value appraisals of agricultural lands within the municipality in which the land is located, or the surrounding market area, or both; (2) considering farmland and development easement values in counties and municipalities reasonably contiguous to, but outside of, the municipality in which the land to be acquired is located; (3) considering the importance of preserving agricultural lands in the municipality and county in which the land is located; (4) considering the status and value of natural resources in the municipality and county in which the land is located, and in counties and municipalities that are reasonably contiguous to, but outside of, the municipality and county in which the land is located; (5)   considering such other relevant factors as may be necessary to increase participation in the farmland preservation program by owners of agricultural lands located in the municipality and county in which the land is located, including, but not limited to, the rate of inflation, the quality of the agricultural soils, the size of the agricultural lands to be acquired, and the risk of conversion of the land from productive agriculture to nonagricultural use; and (6) providing additional value for the proximity of agricultural lands located adjacent to preserved agricultural lands, lands preserved for recreation and conservation purposes, aquifer recharge areas, lands subject to development or conservation easements, and lands whose conversion to nonagricultural use would lead to conflicting land uses, including, but not limited to, utility and roadway rights-of-way, military bases, and airports and associated airspace. The SADC would adopt rules and regulations to establish the Statewide Farmland Preservation Formula, notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.  These rules and regulations would remain in effect for a period not to exceed three years after the date of the filing and thereafter be adopted, amended, or readopted in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. In addition, the bill would amend current law concerning how value is to be calculated when the value of the farmland to be acquired is determined based upon the value of any pinelands development credits allocated to the parcel pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto.  Under this bill, that value would include consideration of the rate of inflation. A landowner would be provided with the values determined pursuant to these different methods and the higher of the values would be used as the basis for negotiation with the landowner with respect to the acquisition price.

(2)   In prioritizing applications for funding submitted by local government units in the Highlands planning area, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), to acquire development easements on farmland in the Highlands planning area using moneys from the Garden State Farmland Preservation Trust Fund, the committee shall accord a higher weight to any application submitted by a local government unit to preserve farmland in a municipality in the Highlands planning area that has amended its development regulations in accordance with section 13 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-13) to establish one or more receiving zones for the transfer of development potential from the Highlands preservation area, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), than that which is accorded to comparable applications submitted by other local government units to preserve farmland in municipalities in the Highlands planning area that have not made such amendments to their development regulations. m.   Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-1 et seq.) to the contrary, for State fiscal years 2005 through 2009, the sum spent by the committee in each of those fiscal years for the acquisition by the committee of development easements and fee simple titles to farmland for farmland preservation purposes using moneys from the Garden State Farmland Preservation Trust Fund in each county of the State shall be not less, and may be greater if additional sums become available, than the average annual sum spent by the department therefor in each such county, respectively, for State fiscal years 2002 through 2004, provided there is sufficient and appropriate farmland within the county to be so acquired by the committee for such purposes. (cf: P.L.2019, c.136, s.9) 2.  Section 8 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-50) is amended to read as follows: 8.  a.  The State Treasurer shall establish a fund to be known as the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund and shall deposit all moneys received pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-47), paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2019, c.136 (C.13:8C-47.1), and any other moneys appropriated by law for deposit into the fund. Moneys in the fund shall be invested in permitted investments or shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in those depositories as the State Treasurer may select, and may be invested and reinvested in permitted investments or as other trust funds in the custody of the State Treasurer in the manner provided by law.  All interest or other income or earnings derived from the investment or reinvestment of moneys in the fund shall be credited to the fund. b.  (1) The moneys in the fund are specifically dedicated and shall be used for the same purposes as those set forth in section 37 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-37) and as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)   Of the moneys deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund:  (a) in State fiscal year 2017 through and including State fiscal year 2019, up to three percent shall be allocated by the committee on an annual basis for stewardship activities; and (b) commencing in State fiscal year 2020 and annually thereafter, up to four percent shall be allocated by the committee on an annual basis for stewardship activities. (3)   Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) to the contrary, stewardship activities undertaken on farmland on which (a) the pinelands development credits have been acquired pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.), and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto, or the development rights have been acquired pursuant to a transfer of development rights program for the Highlands Region established pursuant to section 13 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-13), and (b) there is deed restriction approved by the committee, shall be eligible for funding pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. c.     Moneys in the fund shall not be expended except in accordance with appropriations from the fund made by law.  Any act appropriating moneys from the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund shall identify any particular project or projects to be funded by the moneys, and any expenditure for a project for which the location is not identified by municipality and county in the appropriation shall require the approval of the Joint Budget Oversight Committee, or its successor, except as permitted otherwise in accordance with the same exceptions as those specified in paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 23 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-23). d.    Unexpended moneys due to project withdrawals, cancellations, or cost savings shall be returned to the fund. e.     Notwithstanding the provisions of section 24 of P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-31) or section 38 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-38), or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, to the contrary, when the committee, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization seeks to acquire a development easement on, or fee simple title to, farmland using, in whole or in part, monies deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund, the Garden State Farmland Preservation Trust Fund established pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-20), or any other State monies provided for farmland preservation purposes, the value of the development easement, or fee simple title, as applicable, shall be determined by the following: (1) the procedure set forth in section 24 of P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-31); (2) a value determined in accordance with a formula, to be known as the Statewide Farmland Preservation Formula, which formula is established by rule or regulation adopted by the committee, pursuant to subsection f. of this section, and includes: (a) conducting or analyzing a sufficient number of fair market value appraisals of agricultural lands within the municipality in which the land is located, or the surrounding market area, or both, as the committee deems appropriate to determine the value of the land for farmland preservation; (b) considering farmland and development easement values in counties and municipalities reasonably contiguous to, but outside of, the municipality in which the land to be acquired is located, which in the sole opinion of the committee constitute reasonable farmland and development easement values for the purposes of this subsection; (c) considering the importance of preserving agricultural lands in the municipality and county in which the land is located; (d) considering the status and value of natural resources in the municipality and county in which the land is located, and in counties and municipalities that are reasonably contiguous to, but outside of, the municipality and county in which the land is located; (e) considering such other relevant factors as may be necessary to increase participation in the farmland preservation program by owners of agricultural lands located in the municipality and county in which the land is located, including, but not limited to, the rate of inflation, the quality of the agricultural soils, the size of the agricultural lands to be acquired, and the risk of conversion of the land from productive agriculture to nonagricultural use; and (f) providing additional value for the proximity of agricultural lands located adjacent to preserved agricultural lands, lands preserved for recreation and conservation purposes, aquifer recharge areas, lands subject to development or conservation easements, and lands whose conversion to nonagricultural use would lead to conflicting land uses, including, but not limited to, utility and roadway rights-of-way, military bases, and airports and associated airspace; and, if applicable, (3) (a) in the case of property located in the pinelands area, whenever the value of a development easement on farmland to be acquired is determined based upon the value of any pinelands development credits allocated to the parcel pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto, the value determined by the committee pursuant to subsection e. of section 38 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-38); or (b) in the case of property located in the Highlands Region, the value determined pursuant to subsection j. of section 38 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-38). The landowner shall be provided with the values determined pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, and if applicable, the value determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.  The higher of the values shall be utilized by the committee, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization as the basis for negotiation with the landowner with respect to the acquisition price.  A landowner may waive any of the requirements of this subsection and may agree to sell the lands for less than the values determined pursuant to this subsection. f.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the committee shall, immediately upon filing proper notice with the Office of Administrative Law, adopt rules and regulations to establish the Statewide Farmland Preservation Formula required pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection e. of this section.  The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be in effect for a period not to exceed three years after the date of the filing.  These rules and regulations shall thereafter be adopted, amended, or readopted by the committee in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2019, c.136, s.4) 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would establish a new process for the determination of the value of farmland, and development easements on farmland, to be acquired for farmland preservation purposes by the State Agriculture Development Committee (SADC), a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization using, in whole or in part, constitutionally dedicated Corporation Business Tax monies deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund, the Garden State Farmland Preservation Trust Fund, or any other State monies provided for farmland preservation purposes. This process would be used in addition to the appraisal processes in current law. Under this bill, the committee would adopt a formula, to be known as the Statewide Farmland Preservation Formula, that includes: (1) conducting or analyzing a sufficient number of fair market value appraisals of agricultural lands within the municipality in which the land is located, or the surrounding market area, or both; (2) considering farmland and development easement values in counties and municipalities reasonably contiguous to, but outside of, the municipality in which the land to be acquired is located; (3) considering the importance of preserving agricultural lands in the municipality and county in which the land is located; (4) considering the status and value of natural resources in the municipality and county in which the land is located, and in counties and municipalities that are reasonably contiguous to, but outside of, the municipality and county in which the land is located; (5)   considering such other relevant factors as may be necessary to increase participation in the farmland preservation program by owners of agricultural lands located in the municipality and county in which the land is located, including, but not limited to, the rate of inflation, the quality of the agricultural soils, the size of the agricultural lands to be acquired, and the risk of conversion of the land from productive agriculture to nonagricultural use; and (6) providing additional value for the proximity of agricultural lands located adjacent to preserved agricultural lands, lands preserved for recreation and conservation purposes, aquifer recharge areas, lands subject to development or conservation easements, and lands whose conversion to nonagricultural use would lead to conflicting land uses, including, but not limited to, utility and roadway rights-of-way, military bases, and airports and associated airspace. The SADC would adopt rules and regulations to establish the Statewide Farmland Preservation Formula, notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.  These rules and regulations would remain in effect for a period not to exceed three years after the date of the filing and thereafter be adopted, amended, or readopted in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. In addition, the bill would amend current law concerning how value is to be calculated when the value of the farmland to be acquired is determined based upon the value of any pinelands development credits allocated to the parcel pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto.  Under this bill, that value would include consideration of the rate of inflation. A landowner would be provided with the values determined pursuant to these different methods and the higher of the values would be used as the basis for negotiation with the landowner with respect to the acquisition price.
