STATEMENT This bill establishes an affirmative defense to prosecution for crimes committed by a victim of human trafficking under certain circumstances. Under current law, it is a defense to a prosecution for the following crimes if the perpetrator of the offense is a victim of human trafficking: human trafficking; providing services, resources, or assistance with the knowledge that the services, resources, or assistance are intended to be used in furtherance of the commission of the crime of human trafficking; and prostitution and related offenses. This bill establishes an affirmative defense for human trafficking victims charged with any offense enumerated in Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes if: (1) during the time of the alleged commission of the offense, the defendant was a victim of human trafficking; and (2) the crime was committed as a direct result of the human trafficking offense that was committed against the defendant.  The bill further provides that a defendant who was a victim of human trafficking, may assert an affirmative defense under the bill even if there is the lack of a conviction for the underlying human trafficking offense committed against the defendant as a victim.
