Upon such recall the retired judge shall have all the powers of an administrative law judge and shall be paid a per diem allowance fixed by the Director/ Chief Administrative Law Judge. In addition the recalled judge shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses actually incurred by him in connection with his assignment and shall be provided with such facilities as may be required in the performance of his duties.  Such per diem compensation and expenses shall be paid by the State. Payment for services and expenses shall be made in the same manner as payment is made to the judges of the Office of Administrative Law from which he retired. (cf: P.L.2005, c.6, s.1) 9.    Sections 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 shall take effect immediately. Sections 1, 3, and 4 shall take effect upon enactment of an amendment to Article VI, Section VI, paragraph 3 of the Constitution (pending before the Legislature as Assembly Concurrent Resolution No.____ of this Legislative Session) increasing the mandatory retirement age for Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Superior Court from 70 to 72 years. Should the amendment not be approved by the voters of this State as provided in the Constitution within one year of being submitted to the electorate by the Legislature, sections 1, 3, and 4 of this act shall not take effect. STATEMENT This bill would amend various sections of the statutory law to reflect the new mandatory retirement age of 72 for Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Superior Court based on an amendment to the New Jersey Constitution. The bill would also increase the statutory mandatory retirement age for Judges of the Tax Court, Administrative Law Judges, Judges of the Division of Workers Compensation, and county prosecutors to 72. This bill has a bifurcated effective date since the retirement age for Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Superior Court Judges are set forth in the New Jersey Constitution. In this regard, those sections which pertain to the justices and judges, as well as Judges of the Tax Court (whose statutory salary, pension, and benefits are the same as those for Superior Court judges) would only take effect if the voters of this State approve a constitutional amendment increasing the mandatory retirement age from 70 to 72 within one year of such a proposed amendment being submitted to the voters (see bill sections 1, 3, and 4). Those sections of the bill which increase the retirement age for Administrative Law Judges, Judges of the Division of Workers Compensation, and county prosecutors from 70 to 72 would take effect immediately (see bill sections 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8). It is not the intent of the sponsor to make any other substantive changes to existing law other than to increase the mandatory retirement age, and thus the bill would not affect the current service eligibility requirements for retirement at age 70.

In addition the recalled judge shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses actually incurred by him in connection with his assignment and shall be provided with such facilities as may be required in the performance of his duties.  Such per diem compensation and expenses shall be paid by the State. Payment for services and expenses shall be made in the same manner as payment is made to the judges of the Office of Administrative Law from which he retired. (cf: P.L.2005, c.6, s.1) 9.    Sections 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 shall take effect immediately. Sections 1, 3, and 4 shall take effect upon enactment of an amendment to Article VI, Section VI, paragraph 3 of the Constitution (pending before the Legislature as Assembly Concurrent Resolution No.____ of this Legislative Session) increasing the mandatory retirement age for Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Superior Court from 70 to 72 years. Should the amendment not be approved by the voters of this State as provided in the Constitution within one year of being submitted to the electorate by the Legislature, sections 1, 3, and 4 of this act shall not take effect. STATEMENT This bill would amend various sections of the statutory law to reflect the new mandatory retirement age of 72 for Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Superior Court based on an amendment to the New Jersey Constitution. The bill would also increase the statutory mandatory retirement age for Judges of the Tax Court, Administrative Law Judges, Judges of the Division of Workers Compensation, and county prosecutors to 72. This bill has a bifurcated effective date since the retirement age for Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Superior Court Judges are set forth in the New Jersey Constitution. In this regard, those sections which pertain to the justices and judges, as well as Judges of the Tax Court (whose statutory salary, pension, and benefits are the same as those for Superior Court judges) would only take effect if the voters of this State approve a constitutional amendment increasing the mandatory retirement age from 70 to 72 within one year of such a proposed amendment being submitted to the voters (see bill sections 1, 3, and 4). Those sections of the bill which increase the retirement age for Administrative Law Judges, Judges of the Division of Workers Compensation, and county prosecutors from 70 to 72 would take effect immediately (see bill sections 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8). It is not the intent of the sponsor to make any other substantive changes to existing law other than to increase the mandatory retirement age, and thus the bill would not affect the current service eligibility requirements for retirement at age 70.
