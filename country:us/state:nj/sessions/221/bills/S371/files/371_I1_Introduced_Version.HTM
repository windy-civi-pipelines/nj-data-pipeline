the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    N.J.S.54A:5-1 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     54A:5-1.  New Jersey Gross
Income Defined.  New Jersey gross income shall consist of the following
categories of income:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Salaries, wages, tips,
fees, commissions, bonuses, and other remuneration received for services
rendered whether in cash or in property, and amounts paid or distributed, or
deemed paid or distributed, out of a medical savings account that are not
excluded from gross income pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1997, c.414
(C.54A:6-27).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Net profits from
business.  The net income from the operation of a business, profession or other
activity after provision for all costs and expenses incurred in the conduct
thereof, determined either on a cash or accrual basis in accordance with the
method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes but without
deduction of the amount of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   taxes based on income;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   a civil, civil
administrative, or criminal penalty or fine, including a penalty or fine under
an administrative consent order, assessed and collected for a violation of a
State or federal environmental law, an administrative consent order, or an
environmental ordinance or resolution of a local governmental entity, and any
interest earned on the penalty or fine, and any economic benefits having
accrued to the violator as a result of a violation, which benefits are assessed
and recovered in a civil, civil administrative, or criminal action, or pursuant
to an administrative consent order.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not
apply to a penalty or fine assessed or collected for a violation of a State or
federal environmental law, or local environmental ordinance or resolution, if
the penalty or fine was for a violation that resulted from fire, riot,
sabotage, flood, storm event, natural cause, or other act of God beyond the
reasonable control of the violator, or caused by an act or omission of a person
who was outside the reasonable control of the violator; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   treble damages paid to
the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to subsection a. of section
7 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11f) for costs incurred by the department in
removing, or arranging for the removal of, an unauthorized discharge upon the
failure of the discharger to comply with a directive from the department to
remove, or arrange for the removal of, a discharge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Net gains or income
from disposition of property.  Net gains or net income, less net losses,
derived from the sale, exchange or other disposition of property, including
real or personal, whether tangible or intangible as determined in accordance
with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes.  For the
purpose of determining gain or loss, the basis of property shall be the
adjusted basis used for federal income tax purposes, except as expressly
provided for under this act, but without a deduction for penalties, fines, or
economic benefits excepted pursuant to paragraph (2), or for treble damages excepted
pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A taxpayer's net gain or loss
on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a share of an S corporation shall
be calculated by increasing the adjusted basis of the share by an amount equal
to the shareholder's net losses and deductions in respect of the share allowed
and deducted from income for federal income tax purposes, not including any
personal net operating loss deductions, to the extent that such net losses were
not offset by the taxpayer's pro rata share of S corporation income otherwise
subject to taxation pursuant to subsection p. of this section in respect of
another S corporation, subject to rules of priority and assignment determined
by the director.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the tax year 1976, any taxpayer
with a tax liability under this subsection, or under the &quot;Tax on Capital
Gains and Other Unearned Income Act,&quot; P.L.1975, c.172 (C.54:8B-1 et seq.),
shall not be subject to payment of an amount greater than the amount he would
have paid if either return had covered all capital transactions during the full
tax year 1976; provided, however, that the rate which shall apply to any
capital gain shall be that in effect on the date of the transaction.  To the
extent that any loss is used to offset any gain under P.L.1975, c.172, it shall
not be used to offset any gain under the &quot;New Jersey Gross Income Tax
Act,&quot; N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The term &quot;net gains or
income&quot; shall not include gains or income derived from obligations which
are referred to in clause (1) or (2) of N.J.S.54A:6-14 of this act or from
securities which evidence ownership in a qualified investment fund as defined
in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.310 (C.54A:6-14.1).  The term &quot;net gains or
income&quot; shall not include gains or income derived from the sale or
assignment of a tax credit transfer certificate pursuant to section 7 of
P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-248) and section 10 of P.L.2014, c.63 (C.34:1B-251)
from any sale or assignment of a tax credit issued pursuant to an award of tax
credits approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority prior to July
1, 2018, regardless of when such sale or assignment occurs.  The term &quot;net
gains or net income&quot; shall not include gains or income from transactions
to the extent to which nonrecognition is allowed for federal income tax
purposes.  The term &quot;sale, exchange or other disposition&quot; shall not
include the exchange of stock or securities in a corporation a party to a
reorganization in pursuance of a plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities
in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization and
the transfer of property to a corporation by one or more persons solely in
exchange for stock or securities in such corporation if immediately after the
exchange such person or persons are in control of the corporation.  For
purposes of this clause, stock or securities issued for services shall not be
considered as issued in return for property.</p>

will, like other pension payments, they will qualify for the New Jersey pension
payment exclusion).  This bill also makes a technical change to the statute
governing the taxation of pay-outs, to specify the method used for determining
the taxable amount for New Jersey tax purposes will be the same as the method
used for federal tax purposes.</p>
