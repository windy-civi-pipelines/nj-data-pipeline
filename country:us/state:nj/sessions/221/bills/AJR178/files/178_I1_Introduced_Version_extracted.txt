STATEMENT This joint resolution urges the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to study the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for veterans. While serving their country, military members can come across various traumatic events through circumstances such as war zone deployment, training accidents, and military sexual trauma. Among veterans using health care provided by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, 23 percent had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at some point in their life.  PTSD can cause chemical changes in the bodys hormonal system and autonomic nervous system, as well as changes to brain activity and structure.  Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been effective in treating disruptions of brain structure and functions, making it a potential alternative treatment for PTSD. In 2017, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs announced it would offer HBOT as a treatment option for a small group of veterans with PTSD symptoms resistant to standard treatments.  Additionally, two evidence briefs on the use of HBOT to treat veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and PTSD in whom other treatments have not been successful were prepared for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.  On April 16, 2024, legislation establishing a pilot program at the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to furnish HBOT for veterans who have PTSD or TBI passed the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health by voice vote.  It is important that a study on the efficacy of HBOT be conducted to determine if the treatment will bring about beneficial changes for the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces who proudly serve the nation and risk their lives to protect our freedom.
