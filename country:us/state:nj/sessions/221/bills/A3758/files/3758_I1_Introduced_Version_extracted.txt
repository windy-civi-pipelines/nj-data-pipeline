A3758 ASSEMBLY, No. 3758 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 22, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  CAROL A. MURPHY District 7 (Burlington) SYNOPSIS Conforms Megans law to requirements of federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning sex offender registration and notification requirements and the sex offender Internet registry, amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law, and repealing section 3 of P.L.1994, c.128 and section 7 of P.L.2001, c.167. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  a.  When the Legislature originally enacted Megans Law in 1994, it found and declared that the dangers of recidivism posed by sex offenders and offenders who commit other predatory acts against children, and the dangers posed by persons who prey on others as a result of mental illness, require a system of registration that will permit law enforcement officials to identify and alert the public when necessary for the public safety, and that a system of registration of sex offenders and offenders who commit other predatory acts against children will provide law enforcement with additional information critical to preventing and promptly resolving incidents involving sexual abuse and missing persons. b.    A similar remedial purpose attended the 2001 enactment of the law authorizing the establishment of a sex offender Internet registry, as the Legislature found and declared that the public safety will be enhanced by making information about certain sex offenders contained in the sex offender central registry available to the public through the Internet, that knowledge of whether a person is a convicted sex offender at risk of re-offense could be a significant factor in protecting oneself and one's family members, or those in care of a group or community organization, from recidivist acts by the offender, and that the technology afforded by the Internet would make this information readily accessible to parents and private entities, enabling them to undertake appropriate remedial precautions to prevent or avoid placing potential victims at risk. c.     The Legislature hereby reaffirms and readopts the above findings and declarations by enacting this law intended to conform the provisions of New Jerseys Megans Law to the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (hereinafter SORNA), P.L.109-248.  Under the SORNA scheme, information about all persons convicted of or acquitted by reason of insanity for a sex offense committed as an adult would be made available to the public through the Internet for the duration of the persons registration obligations under the law.  Additionally, SORNA affords states the discretion to make information about juvenile sex offenders and those convicted of certain less serious sex offenses available on the Internet.  In consideration of the circumstances of youthful sex offenders and the interest in rehabilitation, this legislation imposes registration requirements upon these offenders but does not include information about juvenile sex offenders on the Internet registry unless the juvenile was tried as an adult for the sex offense committed. d.    Basing an offenders registration obligations solely on the sex offense committed which gives rise to the registration obligation, rather than utilizing a risk-based classification, allows a more expedient process, as the classification of an offender may take place at the time of sentencing, thereby eliminating a potential gap in time between a registrants release from custody or relocation and actual notification while awaiting completion of the risk-based tier classification process.  The uniform classification of sex offenders based solely on the offense committed also enables New Jersey to provide this information for inclusion in the National Sex Offender Registry, thereby avoiding a 10 percent reduction annually in the State allocated share of federal Edward Byrne law enforcement grant funding, and allows New Jersey to exchange this information with other states when registered sex offenders relocate to or from, or travel to this State.  The Internet publication scheme envisioned by SORNA provides the public with identifying information about a greater number of sex offenders than under the current law, and employs geographically-based Internet searches and electronic notification rather than the cumbersome and resource-intensive process of hand-delivery of notification fliers.  These changes are intended to continue to promote public safety by providing the public with access to relevant information about those who commit sex offenses, to enable responsible organizations and individuals to take appropriate precautions to protect themselves and those in their care from the risk posed by sex offenders, through a more efficient, uniform and fiscally prudent system of registration and notification. e.     A primary characteristic of offense-based offender classification is uniformity.  In 2007, the Legislature noted questions concerning whether Megans Law is consistently applied in the 21 counties, and expressed an intent to make the laws application more uniform and equitable.  Concerns were raised that offenders would move from county to county, or relocate to a particular county, either to avoid receiving a final tier classification or to seek to obtain a lower classification, thereby delaying, avoiding, or reducing the scope of community notification or Internet publication.  Basing registration obligations solely on the sex offense committed provides a uniform classification scheme that will be applied consistently, regardless of the registrants county of residence. From a national perspective, this uniformity reflects that, in our mobile society, sex offender registration and notification can be more effective if the requirements of the law are consistent from state to state and cannot be evaded by moving between jurisdictions to take advantage of potential gaps and loopholes.  The national standards established under SORNA enable jurisdictions to track registered sex offenders seamlessly, with consistent and uniform classification and treatment. f.     Accordingly, consistent with the authority provided in Article IV, Section VII, paragraph 12 of the New Jersey Constitution, this legislation revises the scope, manner, and format of the disclosure to the general public of information pertaining to the identity, specific and general whereabouts, physical characteristics, and criminal history of persons found to have committed a sex offense.  The Legislature finds and declares that sex offender registration and the provision of public access to sex offender registry information in conformance with the requirements of SORNA is intended solely for the protection of the public, and is not intended to impose additional criminal punishment upon any person required to register under this act. 2.    Section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a. (1)  The following persons shall register as provided in subsections c. and d. of this section: (a)   A person who has been convicted [, adjudicated delinquent] or found not guilty by reason of insanity for commission of a sex offense or attempt or conspiracy to commit a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of this section [shall register as provided in subsections c. and d. of this section.]; (b)   A person who has been adjudicated delinquent for commission of a sex offense or attempt or conspiracy to commit a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of this section; (c)   A person who is convicted after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) of a crime other than a sex offense and was convicted after the effective date of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-1 et al.) of a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of this section but was not previously required to register pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2); and (d)   A person who was convicted of a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of this section after the effective date of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-1 et al.) but prior to the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and is currently serving the sentence imposed for that conviction and who was not previously required to register pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2).

(cf: P.L.2001, c.167, s.8) 16.    The following sections are repealed: Section 3 of P.L.1994, c.128 (C.2C:7-8); and Section 7 of P.L.2001, c.167 (C.2C:7-18). 17.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the sixth month following enactment, provided however, that the Attorney General, Superintendent of State Police, Commissioner of Corrections, Commissioner of Human Services, Executive Director of the Juvenile Justice Commission, Chairman of the State Parole Board, Administrative Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts, county prosecutors, and chief law enforcement officers of local police departments and forces may take such anticipatory action in advance as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this act. STATEMENT This bill revises New Jerseys Megans Law in response to requirements of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), enacted as part of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. SORNA created standards for state sex offender registration and community notification.  In response to SORNA, this bill revises the scope, manner, and format of the disclosure to the general public of information pertaining to the identity, specific and general whereabouts, physical characteristics, and criminal history of persons found to have committed a sex offense. Under the SORNA scheme, information about adult sex offenders would be made available to the public through the Internet for the duration of the persons registration obligations under the law.  In consideration of the circumstances of juvenile sex offenders and the interest in their rehabilitation, this bill requires them to register but does not include their information on the Internet registry unless the juvenile was tried as an adult. Under the bills provisions, the offender will be classified as a 15-year, 25-year, or lifetime registrant based upon the offense committed.  This bill, as does current law, requires sex offenders to verify their addresses with the appropriate law enforcement agency.  The SORNA verification requirements implemented under this bill are based upon the offenders classification as a 15-year, 25-year, or lifetime registrant.  A 15-year registrant will be required to verify his or her address with the appropriate law enforcement agency every 365 days; a 25-year registrant, every 180 days.  A lifetime registrant is required to verify his or her address every 90 days. Under current law, New Jersey uses a risk-based tier classification process.  The county prosecutors conduct a risk assessment for each convicted sex offender to determine the offenders risk of committing future offenses; the offenders tier classification for purposes of registration and the type of notification to the community are based upon the risk assessment.  SORNA, however, bases the offenders obligation to register upon the sex offense committed, which allows a more expedient process.  This bill requires that the offender be classified at the time of sentencing, which eliminates a potential gap in time between a registrants release from custody or relocation and actual notification while awaiting completion of the risk-based tier classification process.  The bill also requires the information to be provided to the National Sex Offender Registry and to be exchanged with other states when registered sex offenders relocate to or from or travel to this State.  Utilizing a system of offense-based classification also permits New Jersey to avoid a 10 percent reduction annually in the State allocated share of federal Edward Byrne law enforcement grant funding. The Internet publication scheme envisioned by SORNA, which this bill implements, provides the public with information about a greater number of sex offenders than the information provided under current law.  SORNA employs geographically-based Internet searches and electronic notification rather than the cumbersome and resource-intensive process of hand-delivery of notification fliers.  This bill provides for a more efficient, uniform, and fiscally prudent system of registration and notification that promotes public safety by: (1) providing access to relevant information about sex offenders, and (2) enabling responsible organizations and individuals to take appropriate precautions to protect themselves and those in their care from the risk posed by sex offenders. The bill requires offenders to notify law enforcement of any international travel at least 21 days in advance.  Any offender who fails to notify law enforcement or provides false information concerning international travel is guilty of a crime of the third degree. In 2007, the Legislature noted questions concerning whether Megans Law is consistently applied in the 21 counties.  The system of registration and notification created in this bill provides for a more uniform and consistent classification scheme, regardless of the registrants county of residence.  Sex offender registration and notification will be more effective in todays mobile society if laws are consistent among the states and other jurisdictions and cannot be evaded by moving between jurisdictions to take advantage of potential time gaps and loopholes.

A3758 ASSEMBLY, No. 3758 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 22, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  CAROL A. MURPHY District 7 (Burlington) SYNOPSIS Conforms Megans law to requirements of federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning sex offender registration and notification requirements and the sex offender Internet registry, amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law, and repealing section 3 of P.L.1994, c.128 and section 7 of P.L.2001, c.167. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  a.  When the Legislature originally enacted Megans Law in 1994, it found and declared that the dangers of recidivism posed by sex offenders and offenders who commit other predatory acts against children, and the dangers posed by persons who prey on others as a result of mental illness, require a system of registration that will permit law enforcement officials to identify and alert the public when necessary for the public safety, and that a system of registration of sex offenders and offenders who commit other predatory acts against children will provide law enforcement with additional information critical to preventing and promptly resolving incidents involving sexual abuse and missing persons. b.    A similar remedial purpose attended the 2001 enactment of the law authorizing the establishment of a sex offender Internet registry, as the Legislature found and declared that the public safety will be enhanced by making information about certain sex offenders contained in the sex offender central registry available to the public through the Internet, that knowledge of whether a person is a convicted sex offender at risk of re-offense could be a significant factor in protecting oneself and one's family members, or those in care of a group or community organization, from recidivist acts by the offender, and that the technology afforded by the Internet would make this information readily accessible to parents and private entities, enabling them to undertake appropriate remedial precautions to prevent or avoid placing potential victims at risk. c.     The Legislature hereby reaffirms and readopts the above findings and declarations by enacting this law intended to conform the provisions of New Jerseys Megans Law to the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (hereinafter SORNA), P.L.109-248.  Under the SORNA scheme, information about all persons convicted of or acquitted by reason of insanity for a sex offense committed as an adult would be made available to the public through the Internet for the duration of the persons registration obligations under the law.  Additionally, SORNA affords states the discretion to make information about juvenile sex offenders and those convicted of certain less serious sex offenses available on the Internet.  In consideration of the circumstances of youthful sex offenders and the interest in rehabilitation, this legislation imposes registration requirements upon these offenders but does not include information about juvenile sex offenders on the Internet registry unless the juvenile was tried as an adult for the sex offense committed. d.    Basing an offenders registration obligations solely on the sex offense committed which gives rise to the registration obligation, rather than utilizing a risk-based classification, allows a more expedient process, as the classification of an offender may take place at the time of sentencing, thereby eliminating a potential gap in time between a registrants release from custody or relocation and actual notification while awaiting completion of the risk-based tier classification process.  The uniform classification of sex offenders based solely on the offense committed also enables New Jersey to provide this information for inclusion in the National Sex Offender Registry, thereby avoiding a 10 percent reduction annually in the State allocated share of federal Edward Byrne law enforcement grant funding, and allows New Jersey to exchange this information with other states when registered sex offenders relocate to or from, or travel to this State.  The Internet publication scheme envisioned by SORNA provides the public with identifying information about a greater number of sex offenders than under the current law, and employs geographically-based Internet searches and electronic notification rather than the cumbersome and resource-intensive process of hand-delivery of notification fliers.  These changes are intended to continue to promote public safety by providing the public with access to relevant information about those who commit sex offenses, to enable responsible organizations and individuals to take appropriate precautions to protect themselves and those in their care from the risk posed by sex offenders, through a more efficient, uniform and fiscally prudent system of registration and notification. e.     A primary characteristic of offense-based offender classification is uniformity.  In 2007, the Legislature noted questions concerning whether Megans Law is consistently applied in the 21 counties, and expressed an intent to make the laws application more uniform and equitable.  Concerns were raised that offenders would move from county to county, or relocate to a particular county, either to avoid receiving a final tier classification or to seek to obtain a lower classification, thereby delaying, avoiding, or reducing the scope of community notification or Internet publication.  Basing registration obligations solely on the sex offense committed provides a uniform classification scheme that will be applied consistently, regardless of the registrants county of residence. From a national perspective, this uniformity reflects that, in our mobile society, sex offender registration and notification can be more effective if the requirements of the law are consistent from state to state and cannot be evaded by moving between jurisdictions to take advantage of potential gaps and loopholes.  The national standards established under SORNA enable jurisdictions to track registered sex offenders seamlessly, with consistent and uniform classification and treatment. f.     Accordingly, consistent with the authority provided in Article IV, Section VII, paragraph 12 of the New Jersey Constitution, this legislation revises the scope, manner, and format of the disclosure to the general public of information pertaining to the identity, specific and general whereabouts, physical characteristics, and criminal history of persons found to have committed a sex offense.  The Legislature finds and declares that sex offender registration and the provision of public access to sex offender registry information in conformance with the requirements of SORNA is intended solely for the protection of the public, and is not intended to impose additional criminal punishment upon any person required to register under this act. 2.    Section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a. (1)  The following persons shall register as provided in subsections c. and d. of this section: (a)   A person who has been convicted [, adjudicated delinquent] or found not guilty by reason of insanity for commission of a sex offense or attempt or conspiracy to commit a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of this section [shall register as provided in subsections c. and d. of this section.]; (b)   A person who has been adjudicated delinquent for commission of a sex offense or attempt or conspiracy to commit a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of this section; (c)   A person who is convicted after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) of a crime other than a sex offense and was convicted after the effective date of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-1 et al.) of a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of this section but was not previously required to register pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2); and (d)   A person who was convicted of a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of this section after the effective date of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-1 et al.) but prior to the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and is currently serving the sentence imposed for that conviction and who was not previously required to register pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2).

(cf: P.L.2001, c.167, s.8) 16.    The following sections are repealed: Section 3 of P.L.1994, c.128 (C.2C:7-8); and Section 7 of P.L.2001, c.167 (C.2C:7-18). 17.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the sixth month following enactment, provided however, that the Attorney General, Superintendent of State Police, Commissioner of Corrections, Commissioner of Human Services, Executive Director of the Juvenile Justice Commission, Chairman of the State Parole Board, Administrative Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts, county prosecutors, and chief law enforcement officers of local police departments and forces may take such anticipatory action in advance as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this act. STATEMENT This bill revises New Jerseys Megans Law in response to requirements of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), enacted as part of the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. SORNA created standards for state sex offender registration and community notification.  In response to SORNA, this bill revises the scope, manner, and format of the disclosure to the general public of information pertaining to the identity, specific and general whereabouts, physical characteristics, and criminal history of persons found to have committed a sex offense. Under the SORNA scheme, information about adult sex offenders would be made available to the public through the Internet for the duration of the persons registration obligations under the law.  In consideration of the circumstances of juvenile sex offenders and the interest in their rehabilitation, this bill requires them to register but does not include their information on the Internet registry unless the juvenile was tried as an adult. Under the bills provisions, the offender will be classified as a 15-year, 25-year, or lifetime registrant based upon the offense committed.  This bill, as does current law, requires sex offenders to verify their addresses with the appropriate law enforcement agency.  The SORNA verification requirements implemented under this bill are based upon the offenders classification as a 15-year, 25-year, or lifetime registrant.  A 15-year registrant will be required to verify his or her address with the appropriate law enforcement agency every 365 days; a 25-year registrant, every 180 days.  A lifetime registrant is required to verify his or her address every 90 days. Under current law, New Jersey uses a risk-based tier classification process.  The county prosecutors conduct a risk assessment for each convicted sex offender to determine the offenders risk of committing future offenses; the offenders tier classification for purposes of registration and the type of notification to the community are based upon the risk assessment.  SORNA, however, bases the offenders obligation to register upon the sex offense committed, which allows a more expedient process.  This bill requires that the offender be classified at the time of sentencing, which eliminates a potential gap in time between a registrants release from custody or relocation and actual notification while awaiting completion of the risk-based tier classification process.  The bill also requires the information to be provided to the National Sex Offender Registry and to be exchanged with other states when registered sex offenders relocate to or from or travel to this State.  Utilizing a system of offense-based classification also permits New Jersey to avoid a 10 percent reduction annually in the State allocated share of federal Edward Byrne law enforcement grant funding. The Internet publication scheme envisioned by SORNA, which this bill implements, provides the public with information about a greater number of sex offenders than the information provided under current law.  SORNA employs geographically-based Internet searches and electronic notification rather than the cumbersome and resource-intensive process of hand-delivery of notification fliers.  This bill provides for a more efficient, uniform, and fiscally prudent system of registration and notification that promotes public safety by: (1) providing access to relevant information about sex offenders, and (2) enabling responsible organizations and individuals to take appropriate precautions to protect themselves and those in their care from the risk posed by sex offenders. The bill requires offenders to notify law enforcement of any international travel at least 21 days in advance.  Any offender who fails to notify law enforcement or provides false information concerning international travel is guilty of a crime of the third degree. In 2007, the Legislature noted questions concerning whether Megans Law is consistently applied in the 21 counties.  The system of registration and notification created in this bill provides for a more uniform and consistent classification scheme, regardless of the registrants county of residence.  Sex offender registration and notification will be more effective in todays mobile society if laws are consistent among the states and other jurisdictions and cannot be evaded by moving between jurisdictions to take advantage of potential time gaps and loopholes.
