(pending before the Legislature as this bill), 2[shall renew automatically]2 upon filing of the necessary renewal forms with the commission, and payment of any renewal fees required by the commission 2, provided the commission determines that the qualifications set forth in this subsection and any applicable regulations promulgated by the commission have been satisfied2. The commission shall issue a license pursuant to this subsection only if the permit holder at Monmouth Park and the thoroughbred and standardbred permit holders at Meadowlands Racetrack schedule at least the minimum number of race dates required in section 30 of this act, P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-156), and it is satisfied that the authority has entered into a participation agreement with each and every other person, partnership, association, corporation, or authority or the successor in interest to such person, partnership, association, corporation or authority that: (1)   held a valid permit to hold or conduct a race horse meeting within this State in the calendar year 2000 2or holds a current, valid permit to hold or conduct a race horse meeting within this State2; (2)   has complied with the terms of such permit; and (3)   is in good standing with the commission and the State of New Jersey.

[Notwithstanding any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, a permit holder subject to a participation agreement entered into prior to the effective date of P.L.2011, c.26 shall have made progress since the signing of that agreement toward establishing the permit holder's share of the 15 off-track wagering facilities authorized pursuant to section 10 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-136), provided that any facility that has not received a license under section 7 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-133) on the effective date of this act, P.L.2011, c.205 shall be subject to a cash deposit, a bond, or an irrevocable letter of credit to be posted or deposited by the permit holder in the amount of $1 million for each facility in the permit holder's share that remains to be licensed, which deposit shall be paid to the commission within 180 days of the effective date of this act, P.L.2011, c.205.  A permit holder making a deposit or posting a bond, or irrevocable letter of credit, in connection with one or more of the off-track wagering facilities in the permit holder's share that remain to be established shall obtain the license and make substantial progress in the commission's judgment pursuant to the progress benchmarks issued by the commission and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority under subsection e. of this section toward establishing the off-track wagering facility or facilities within one year of making the deposit, or posting the bond, or irrevocable letter of credit, and if so the deposit, bond, or irrevocable letter of credit shall be returned to the permit holder at the end of the one-year period, or the amount deposited or posted shall be forfeited and distributed by the commission to the representative horsemen's organization in this State for use in establishing an off-track wagering facility or facilities under paragraph (2) of this subsection.  Any facility that has not been licensed on the effective date of this act, P.L.2011, c.205, and for which a deposit, bond, or irrevocable letter of credit is not made or posted, and any facility for which a deposit, bond, or irrevocable letter of credit is made or posted which has not been licensed and made progress toward establishment within one year of making such deposit or posting the bond, or irrevocable letter of credit, shall no longer be considered as part of the permit holder's share, and shall be available to be established by a horsemen's organization in this State as provided by paragraph (2) of this subsection.  However, if the commission finds that a permit holder is making progress toward obtaining an off-track wagering license and establishing an off-track wagering facility according to specified benchmarks developed by the commission, the commission may allow a permit holder to retain its share of the off-track wagering facilities to be established, provided the permit holder continues to make progress on an annual basis.  For the purposes of this section, a permit holder shall be deemed to have made progress toward establishing its share of off-track wagering facilities, and shall not be subject to a cash deposit or be required to post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit as set forth in this section, if it has entered into an agreement, in connection with good faith negotiations over the sale or lease of a racetrack under the permit holder's control, to transfer allocated off-track wagering licenses or facilities to an individual or entity that is a bona fide prospective purchaser or lessee, or has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that the execution of such an agreement is imminent based upon the portions of such an agreement agreed upon in principle by the parties as evidenced by a memorandum of understanding or similar accord, or has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commission that negotiations concerning such an agreement have been unsuccessful and the permit holder has plans for soliciting new sources of interest or entering into new negotiations that, in the judgment of the commission, have a reasonable likelihood of resulting in a successful conclusion. (2)   The commission is authorized to issue a license or licenses to any horsemen's organization in this State, for the establishment of one or more of the remaining off-track wagering facilities in partnership with other horsemen's organizations in this State, the authority, or private investors, in accordance with all applicable provisions of the "Off-Track and Account Wagering Act," P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-127 et seq.).  Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, a representative standardbred horsemen's organization shall have the right to establish the off-track wagering facilities not established by the permit holder at Freehold Raceway as provided under paragraph (1) of this subsection, and to receive any deposit, bond, or irrevocable letter of credit forfeited by that permit holder for the establishment of one or more of those off-track wagering facilities, except that if a representative standardbred horsemen's organization does not make application therefor, or fails to make progress in establishing the facility or facilities as provided herein, any amounts received shall be returned as provided in this paragraph and the facility or facilities shall be available to be established in accordance with subsection c. of this section.  A horsemen's organization shall make progress on an annual basis in establishing an off-track wagering facility from the date the organization is eligible to apply for an initial license pursuant to this subsection, provided that any facility that has not received a license under section 7 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-133) within a reasonable timeframe from the date the horsemen's organization became eligible to apply for its initial license shall no longer be considered eligible to be established by a horsemen's organization under this paragraph, and shall be available to be established by a well-suited entity pursuant to subsection c. of this section. When a horsemen's organization under this paragraph has received the sum of $1 million as provided under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the horsemen's organization shall have one year from the date the funds are allocated to it by the commission to obtain a license and make substantial progress in establishing the off-track wagering facility or facilities, provided that, if the horsemen's organization fails to make progress within that year, in the commission's judgment pursuant to the progress benchmarks issued by the commission and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority under subsection e. of this section, the horsemen's organization shall be liable to return to the commission the funds allocated to it in their entirety at the end of the one-year period, and the commission shall return such funds to the permit holder originally making the deposit, or posting the bond or irrevocable letter of credit, to be used for capital improvements at the permit holder's racetrack.] c.     [With respect to any licenses that remain to be issued under paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section, the commission is also authorized to issue a license to a well-suited entity to permit off-track wagering at a specified facility, upon application of the entity and in accordance with the provisions of this act and the provisions of section 14 of P.L.1940, c.17 (C.5:5-34).  A license issued pursuant to this act shall be valid for a period of one year and, if the licensed entity is not a permit holder in this State, the license shall be contingent upon the licensee showing simulcast New Jersey races and allowing wagering thereon at the off-track wagering facility, subject to the rules and regulations of the commission, and shall be issued only if the permit holders schedule at least the minimum number of race dates required in section 30 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-156).  In assessing the qualifications of an entity to establish and conduct an off-track wagering facility, the commission shall apply substantially similar standards and criteria to those applied to the authority, its assignees, and other permit holders and licensees in the State. These standards and criteria shall enable the commission to determine by clear and convincing evidence in the opinion of the commission that the person or persons applying for licensure on behalf of the entity are well-suited to receive licensure, and shall include, but may not be limited to: (1)   proof of financial resources sufficient to enable the entity to establish and conduct a quality off-track wagering facility or facilities with appropriately staffed and managed operations; (2)   evidence of good character, honesty, competency and integrity; (3)   the absence of a conviction for a crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude; and (4)   any additional standards and criteria the commission may establish by rule or regulation in accordance with this act.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.              , c.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). d. [(1) The commission, in consultation with the State Treasurer, shall develop a process by which the commission will accept bids for each off-track wagering license to be awarded under this act, P.L.2001, c.199.  An off-track wagering licensee and an entity interested in establishing an off-track wagering facility and being licensed as an off-track wagering licensee shall be eligible to submit a bid.  The bidding process shall include procedures for the establishment of a minimum bid threshold, for the selection of a successful bidder and, when the successful bidder is not yet licensed as an off-track wagering licensee, for the awarding of a bid to that successful bidder subject to its eligibility to be licensed as an off-track wagering licensee in compliance with the provisions of this act, P.L.2001, c.199.  As part of the bidding process, and in addition to submitting a monetary bid, a bidder shall submit to the commission a conceptual plan of the off-track wagering facility the bidder intends to establish, which shall include, but may not be limited to, a description of the proposed facility and the amenities it would offer, and its proposed or intended location.  In selecting a successful bidder, the commission shall consider and balance the following:  (a) the monetary value of the bid in comparison to other bids submitted; (b) the level of quality of the proposed facility and amenities in striving to be a first-rate experience for the customer that includes the provision of first-class dining facilities; (c) the potential of the proposed facility and amenities to generate greater interest in the horse racing industry and the sport of horse racing in the State; and (d) the proximity of the bidder's proposed or intended location for the off-track wagering facility and its impact on other planned or existing off-track wagering facilities and racetracks in the State.  For the purposes of this act, P.L.2001, c.199, a successful bid shall be conditional upon the successful bidder's compliance with all the provisions of this act, P.L.2001, c.199, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the commission. (2)   The commission shall consider the amount of a successful bid pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection as a license fee in connection with the issuance of an initial license to an off-track wagering facility licensee.  The initial license fee need not be uniform for all off-track wagering facility licenses, and may vary depending on the results of the bidding process for each license. The proceeds generated by the initial license fee shall be distributed as follows:  50% to the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association for programs designed to aid the horsemen, and 50% to the Standardbred Breeders' and Owners' Association of New Jersey for programs designed to aid the horsemen.]  (Deleted by amendment, P.L.                 , c.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). e.     [The commission shall, in consultation with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, develop progress benchmarks, within three months of the effective date of P.L.2011, c.26, for each off-track wagering licensee to follow for the timely and expeditious establishment of each off-track wagering facility.  Such benchmarks shall provide that a permit holder shall be deemed to have made progress toward establishing its share of off-track wagering facilities if it has entered into an agreement, in connection with good faith negotiations over the sale or lease of a racetrack under the permit holder's control, to transfer allocated off-track wagering licenses or facilities to an individual or entity that is a bona fide prospective purchaser or lessee, or has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that the execution of such an agreement is imminent based upon the portions of such an agreement agreed upon in principle by the parties as evidenced by a memorandum of understanding or similar accord, or has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commission that negotiations concerning such an agreement have been unsuccessful and the permit holder has plans for soliciting new sources of interest or entering into new negotiations that, in the judgment of the commission, have a reasonable likelihood of resulting in a successful conclusion. The failure of a licensee to meet the benchmarks shall constitute a basis for the denial by the commission of the renewal of the off-track wagering license, except that the licensee shall have the right to appeal the commission's decision.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.                 , c.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). f.     Nothing in P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-127 et seq.) shall be construed to limit the ability of a horsemens organization to enter into or enforce a participation agreement or any other partnership agreement with a horse racing permit holder for the operation of an off-track wagering facility pursuant to a valid license issued pursuant to P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-127 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2011, c.205, s.1) 1[4.] 3.1    Section 5 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-131) is amended to read as follows: 5. a.  At the time of filing an application for an off-track wagering license, the applicant shall submit to the commission a non-refundable filing fee in an amount established by regulation by the commission, and a certification in a form prescribed by the commission which specifies, but is not limited to, the following information: (1)  a plan depicting the proposed facility and improvements thereon, including information about the size, seating capacity, parking and services to be provided at the facility; (2)  the location of the proposed facility, and relevant demographic or other information concerning the municipality and surrounding area where the proposed facility is to be located; (3)  the number of permanent and part-time jobs expected to be created at the proposed facility, and gross revenues expected to be generated by the facility; (4)  the fire evacuation plan for the proposed facility; (5)  the type of food and beverages available, which shall include the provision of first-class dining facilities; and (6)  such other information as the commission may require. b.   The applicant shall file a separate application and certification for each proposed off-track wagering facility. c.   The commission shall charge each off-track wagering licensee [an annual] a reasonable fee in connection with the renewal of the off-track wagering license, and shall establish by regulation procedures 2, conditions,2 and [conditions] forms necessary for renewal of licenses issued under this act.  The amount of the [annual] license renewal fee shall be used by the commission to cover commission expenses associated with implementation of the provisions of this act, P.L.2001, c.199, and shall reasonably reflect those costs. 2[1The commission shall not establish or enforce any requirements for the renewal of an off-track wagering license other than the submission of the necessary forms and payment of a reasonable fee established pursuant to this subsection.1]2 d.   The commission shall by regulation establish the maximum hours of operation of off-track wagering facilities. e. (1) Notwithstanding R.S.33:1-42, priority for the service of alcoholic beverages for on-premise consumption at an off-track wagering facility shall be given to a Class C plenary retail consumption licensee, by an agreement or contract with the off-track wagering licensee, pursuant to the provisions of R.S.33:1-1 et seq. in accordance with such procedures as established by statute and by regulation of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control.  When a Class C plenary retail consumption license or licensee is available in the municipality, the authority shall not hold a license to provide alcoholic beverages at an off-track wagering facility.  However, when a Class C plenary retail consumption licensee or license is not available in the municipality, the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control shall issue a special concessionaire permit to the authority for the provision of alcoholic beverages at the off-track wagering facility and, if the off-track wagering license is held by an off-track wagering licensee other than the authority, the director may issue a non-transferable special license to provide alcoholic beverages at the off-track wagering facility pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)  The Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control may issue one special license to an individual, corporation, or other type of legal entity to serve alcoholic beverages at an off-track wagering facility located in the municipality where a Class C plenary retail consumption licensee was not available to provide alcoholic beverages at the off-track wagering facility pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.  The license shall authorize the sale of alcoholic beverages for immediate consumption on the premises of the off-track wagering facility.  The director may issue not more than 15 licenses pursuant to this paragraph.  Furthermore, licenses issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the following requirements: (a)  No person who would fail to qualify as a licensee under Title 33 of the Revised Statutes shall be permitted to hold an interest in a special license under the provisions of this paragraph; (b)  Licenses shall be subject to the provisions of Title 33 of the Revised Statutes and rules and regulations promulgated by the director, to the extent those provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of this act; (c)  No license issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be transferred to any other premises; (d) Application for the initial issuance and renewal of each license shall be made to the director on an annual basis.  The fee for the initial issuance of the license shall be the average sale price for the three most recent sales of plenary retail consumption licenses in the municipality where the license is being issued during the preceding five years.  If the off-track wagering facility is located within the boundaries of two or more municipalities, the highest average sale price of the two or more municipalities shall be used.  If less than three plenary retail consumption licenses have been sold in the municipality or municipalities, as the case may be, within the previous five years, the director shall obtain an appraisal, at the applicant's expense, to determine the appropriate fee for the license.  The appraisal process shall include an examination of previous transactions in the municipality or municipalities, as the case may be, and shall reflect what a willing buyer, under no pressure to buy, would pay a willing seller, under no pressure to sell, for a plenary retail consumption license in that municipality or municipalities, as the case may be.

(2)   The commission is authorized to issue a license or licenses to any horsemen's organization in this State, for the establishment of one or more of the remaining off-track wagering facilities in partnership with other horsemen's organizations in this State, the authority, or private investors, in accordance with all applicable provisions of the "Off-Track and Account Wagering Act," P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-127 et seq.).  Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, a representative standardbred horsemen's organization shall have the right to establish the off-track wagering facilities not established by the permit holder at Freehold Raceway as provided under paragraph (1) of this subsection, and to receive any deposit, bond, or irrevocable letter of credit forfeited by that permit holder for the establishment of one or more of those off-track wagering facilities, except that if a representative standardbred horsemen's organization does not make application therefor, or fails to make progress in establishing the facility or facilities as provided herein, any amounts received shall be returned as provided in this paragraph and the facility or facilities shall be available to be established in accordance with subsection c. of this section.  A horsemen's organization shall make progress on an annual basis in establishing an off-track wagering facility from the date the organization is eligible to apply for an initial license pursuant to this subsection, provided that any facility that has not received a license under section 7 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-133) within a reasonable timeframe from the date the horsemen's organization became eligible to apply for its initial license shall no longer be considered eligible to be established by a horsemen's organization under this paragraph, and shall be available to be established by a well-suited entity pursuant to subsection c. of this section. When a horsemen's organization under this paragraph has received the sum of $1 million as provided under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the horsemen's organization shall have one year from the date the funds are allocated to it by the commission to obtain a license and make substantial progress in establishing the off-track wagering facility or facilities, provided that, if the horsemen's organization fails to make progress within that year, in the commission's judgment pursuant to the progress benchmarks issued by the commission and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority under subsection e. of this section, the horsemen's organization shall be liable to return to the commission the funds allocated to it in their entirety at the end of the one-year period, and the commission shall return such funds to the permit holder originally making the deposit, or posting the bond or irrevocable letter of credit, to be used for capital improvements at the permit holder's racetrack.] c.     [With respect to any licenses that remain to be issued under paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section, the commission is also authorized to issue a license to a well-suited entity to permit off-track wagering at a specified facility, upon application of the entity and in accordance with the provisions of this act and the provisions of section 14 of P.L.1940, c.17 (C.5:5-34).  A license issued pursuant to this act shall be valid for a period of one year and, if the licensed entity is not a permit holder in this State, the license shall be contingent upon the licensee showing simulcast New Jersey races and allowing wagering thereon at the off-track wagering facility, subject to the rules and regulations of the commission, and shall be issued only if the permit holders schedule at least the minimum number of race dates required in section 30 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-156).  In assessing the qualifications of an entity to establish and conduct an off-track wagering facility, the commission shall apply substantially similar standards and criteria to those applied to the authority, its assignees, and other permit holders and licensees in the State. These standards and criteria shall enable the commission to determine by clear and convincing evidence in the opinion of the commission that the person or persons applying for licensure on behalf of the entity are well-suited to receive licensure, and shall include, but may not be limited to: (1)   proof of financial resources sufficient to enable the entity to establish and conduct a quality off-track wagering facility or facilities with appropriately staffed and managed operations; (2)   evidence of good character, honesty, competency and integrity; (3)   the absence of a conviction for a crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude; and (4)   any additional standards and criteria the commission may establish by rule or regulation in accordance with this act.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.              , c.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). d. [(1) The commission, in consultation with the State Treasurer, shall develop a process by which the commission will accept bids for each off-track wagering license to be awarded under this act, P.L.2001, c.199.  An off-track wagering licensee and an entity interested in establishing an off-track wagering facility and being licensed as an off-track wagering licensee shall be eligible to submit a bid.  The bidding process shall include procedures for the establishment of a minimum bid threshold, for the selection of a successful bidder and, when the successful bidder is not yet licensed as an off-track wagering licensee, for the awarding of a bid to that successful bidder subject to its eligibility to be licensed as an off-track wagering licensee in compliance with the provisions of this act, P.L.2001, c.199.  As part of the bidding process, and in addition to submitting a monetary bid, a bidder shall submit to the commission a conceptual plan of the off-track wagering facility the bidder intends to establish, which shall include, but may not be limited to, a description of the proposed facility and the amenities it would offer, and its proposed or intended location.  In selecting a successful bidder, the commission shall consider and balance the following:  (a) the monetary value of the bid in comparison to other bids submitted; (b) the level of quality of the proposed facility and amenities in striving to be a first-rate experience for the customer that includes the provision of first-class dining facilities; (c) the potential of the proposed facility and amenities to generate greater interest in the horse racing industry and the sport of horse racing in the State; and (d) the proximity of the bidder's proposed or intended location for the off-track wagering facility and its impact on other planned or existing off-track wagering facilities and racetracks in the State.  For the purposes of this act, P.L.2001, c.199, a successful bid shall be conditional upon the successful bidder's compliance with all the provisions of this act, P.L.2001, c.199, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the commission. (2)   The commission shall consider the amount of a successful bid pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection as a license fee in connection with the issuance of an initial license to an off-track wagering facility licensee.  The initial license fee need not be uniform for all off-track wagering facility licenses, and may vary depending on the results of the bidding process for each license.

The failure of a licensee to meet the benchmarks shall constitute a basis for the denial by the commission of the renewal of the off-track wagering license, except that the licensee shall have the right to appeal the commission's decision.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.                 , c.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). f.     Nothing in P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-127 et seq.) shall be construed to limit the ability of a horsemens organization to enter into or enforce a participation agreement or any other partnership agreement with a horse racing permit holder for the operation of an off-track wagering facility pursuant to a valid license issued pursuant to P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-127 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2011, c.205, s.1) 1[4.] 3.1    Section 5 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-131) is amended to read as follows: 5. a.  At the time of filing an application for an off-track wagering license, the applicant shall submit to the commission a non-refundable filing fee in an amount established by regulation by the commission, and a certification in a form prescribed by the commission which specifies, but is not limited to, the following information: (1)  a plan depicting the proposed facility and improvements thereon, including information about the size, seating capacity, parking and services to be provided at the facility; (2)  the location of the proposed facility, and relevant demographic or other information concerning the municipality and surrounding area where the proposed facility is to be located; (3)  the number of permanent and part-time jobs expected to be created at the proposed facility, and gross revenues expected to be generated by the facility; (4)  the fire evacuation plan for the proposed facility; (5)  the type of food and beverages available, which shall include the provision of first-class dining facilities; and (6)  such other information as the commission may require. b.   The applicant shall file a separate application and certification for each proposed off-track wagering facility. c.   The commission shall charge each off-track wagering licensee [an annual] a reasonable fee in connection with the renewal of the off-track wagering license, and shall establish by regulation procedures 2, conditions,2 and [conditions] forms necessary for renewal of licenses issued under this act.  The amount of the [annual] license renewal fee shall be used by the commission to cover commission expenses associated with implementation of the provisions of this act, P.L.2001, c.199, and shall reasonably reflect those costs. 2[1The commission shall not establish or enforce any requirements for the renewal of an off-track wagering license other than the submission of the necessary forms and payment of a reasonable fee established pursuant to this subsection.1]2 d.   The commission shall by regulation establish the maximum hours of operation of off-track wagering facilities. e. (1) Notwithstanding R.S.33:1-42, priority for the service of alcoholic beverages for on-premise consumption at an off-track wagering facility shall be given to a Class C plenary retail consumption licensee, by an agreement or contract with the off-track wagering licensee, pursuant to the provisions of R.S.33:1-1 et seq. in accordance with such procedures as established by statute and by regulation of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control.  When a Class C plenary retail consumption license or licensee is available in the municipality, the authority shall not hold a license to provide alcoholic beverages at an off-track wagering facility.  However, when a Class C plenary retail consumption licensee or license is not available in the municipality, the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control shall issue a special concessionaire permit to the authority for the provision of alcoholic beverages at the off-track wagering facility and, if the off-track wagering license is held by an off-track wagering licensee other than the authority, the director may issue a non-transferable special license to provide alcoholic beverages at the off-track wagering facility pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)  The Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control may issue one special license to an individual, corporation, or other type of legal entity to serve alcoholic beverages at an off-track wagering facility located in the municipality where a Class C plenary retail consumption licensee was not available to provide alcoholic beverages at the off-track wagering facility pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.  The license shall authorize the sale of alcoholic beverages for immediate consumption on the premises of the off-track wagering facility.  The director may issue not more than 15 licenses pursuant to this paragraph.  Furthermore, licenses issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the following requirements: (a)  No person who would fail to qualify as a licensee under Title 33 of the Revised Statutes shall be permitted to hold an interest in a special license under the provisions of this paragraph; (b)  Licenses shall be subject to the provisions of Title 33 of the Revised Statutes and rules and regulations promulgated by the director, to the extent those provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of this act; (c)  No license issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be transferred to any other premises; (d) Application for the initial issuance and renewal of each license shall be made to the director on an annual basis.  The fee for the initial issuance of the license shall be the average sale price for the three most recent sales of plenary retail consumption licenses in the municipality where the license is being issued during the preceding five years.  If the off-track wagering facility is located within the boundaries of two or more municipalities, the highest average sale price of the two or more municipalities shall be used.  If less than three plenary retail consumption licenses have been sold in the municipality or municipalities, as the case may be, within the previous five years, the director shall obtain an appraisal, at the applicant's expense, to determine the appropriate fee for the license.  The appraisal process shall include an examination of previous transactions in the municipality or municipalities, as the case may be, and shall reflect what a willing buyer, under no pressure to buy, would pay a willing seller, under no pressure to sell, for a plenary retail consumption license in that municipality or municipalities, as the case may be. One half of the amount of the application fee for the initial issuance of the license shall be paid upon the issuance of the license and the other half of that amount shall be paid one year later. The director shall establish an annual fee for the license which shall not exceed the fee which may be imposed by a municipality for a plenary retail consumption license pursuant to R.S.33:1-12, a portion of which shall be paid by the director to the New Jersey Racing Commission for the funding of horse breeding incentive programs; (e)  The fee for the initial issuance of the license shall be distributed in the following manner: (i)   Twenty-five percent shall be paid to the municipality where the off-track wagering facility is located and if the off-track wagering facility is located within the boundaries of two or more municipalities, the fee shall be divided equally among those municipalities; (ii)  Twenty-five percent shall be paid to the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control; (iii) Fifty percent shall be paid to the New Jersey Racing Commission for the funding of horse breeding incentive programs; (f)  The individual corporation or entity holding the license shall not be entitled to sell a license issued pursuant to this paragraph, and the license shall expire upon the closure of the off-track wagering facility; (g)  The director shall not issue a special concessionaire permit for any off-track wagering facility or premises which is eligible to obtain a license to serve alcoholic beverages under the provisions of this paragraph; and (h)  Pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the director shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this paragraph. (3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to allow the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control to issue a special concessionaire permit or a special license described in paragraph (2) of this subsection to the authority pursuant to this act, P.L.2001, c.199, or to issue a special license to any individual, corporation, or other type of legal entity to serve alcoholic beverages in a municipality that prohibits the retail sale of alcoholic beverages within its boundaries. f.    Persons under the age of 18 years shall not be permitted in any off-track wagering facility, except in dining areas if accompanied by a parent or guardian. g.   The commission shall by regulation establish minimum standards for off-track wagering facilities [and timelines for their establishment and completion], including, but not limited to, standards for quality, size, seating capacity, the provision of first-class dining facilities, and parking and services to be provided [, as well as expected dates of construction, renovations and opening].  The failure of an off-track wagering licensee to meet these standards shall be sufficient cause for the commission to revoke [,] 2[or] ,2 suspend [or refuse to renew] 2, or  refuse to renew2 a license pursuant to the provisions of section 8 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-134). h.   Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, an off-track wagering facility shall be a permitted use in all commercial and industrial districts of a municipality. i.    In evaluating an application for an off-track wagering license, the commission shall consider the proximity of the applicant's proposed site to other planned or existing off-track wagering facilities and to racetracks in this State.  If, in the opinion of the commission, the establishment of the facility at its proposed location would be inimical to the interests of another planned or established off-track wagering facility, or to a State racetrack, the commission shall require the applicant to consider alternative sites for the proposed facility. (cf: P.L.2011, c.26, s.4) 1[5.] 2[4.1  Section 8 of P.L.2001, c.199 (C.5:5-134) is amended to read as follows: 8.  a.  The commission shall have full power to prescribe rules, regulations and conditions under which all off-track wagering licenses are issued [and renewed] in the State, including requiring an annual audit of the off-track wagering licensee's books and records pertaining to off-track wagering, and to revoke [,] or suspend [or refuse to renew] a license if in the opinion of the commission the revocation [of,] or suspension of [or refusal to renew] such license is in the public interest; provided, however, that such rules, regulations and conditions shall be uniform in their application. b.    The commission shall have no right or power to determine who shall be officers, directors or employees of any off-track wagering facility, or the salaries thereof; provided, however, that the commission may compel the discharge of any official or employee of the licensee at the off-track wagering facility who: (1) fails or refuses for any reason to comply with the rules or regulations of the commission; (2) fails or refuses for any reason to comply with any of the provisions of this act; (3) fails to establish by clear and convincing evidence in the opinion of the commission good character, honesty, competency and integrity; or (4) has been convicted of a crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude.
