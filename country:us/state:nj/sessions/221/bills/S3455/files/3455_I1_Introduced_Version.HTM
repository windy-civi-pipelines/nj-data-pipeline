<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e. (1) Notwithstanding
R.S.33:1-42, priority for the service of alcoholic beverages for on-premise
consumption at an off-track wagering facility shall be given to a Class C
plenary retail consumption licensee, by an agreement or contract with the
off-track wagering licensee, pursuant to the provisions of R.S.33:1-1 et seq.
in accordance with such procedures as established by statute and by regulation
of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control.  When a Class C plenary retail
consumption license or licensee is available in the municipality, the authority
shall not hold a license to provide alcoholic beverages at an off-track
wagering facility.  However, when a Class C plenary retail consumption licensee
or license is not available in the municipality, the Director of the Division
of Alcoholic Beverage Control shall issue a special concessionaire permit to
the authority for the provision of alcoholic beverages at the off-track
wagering facility and, if the off-track wagering license is held by an
off-track wagering licensee other than the authority, the director may issue a
non-transferable special license to provide alcoholic beverages at the
off-track wagering facility pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The Director of the
Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control may issue one special license to an
individual, corporation, or other type of legal entity to serve alcoholic
beverages at an off-track wagering facility located in the municipality where a
Class C plenary retail consumption licensee was not available to provide
alcoholic beverages at the off-track wagering facility pursuant to paragraph
(1) of this subsection.  The license shall authorize the sale of alcoholic
beverages for immediate consumption on the premises of the off-track wagering
facility.  The director may issue not more than 15 licenses pursuant to this
paragraph.  Furthermore, licenses issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be
subject to the following requirements:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   No person who would fail
to qualify as a licensee under Title 33 of the Revised Statutes shall be
permitted to hold an interest in a special license under the provisions of this
paragraph;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Licenses shall be
subject to the provisions of Title 33 of the Revised Statutes and rules and
regulations promulgated by the director, to the extent those provisions are not
inconsistent with the provisions of this act;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   No license issued
pursuant to this paragraph shall be transferred to any other premises;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Application for the
initial issuance and renewal of each license shall be made to the director on
an annual basis.  The fee for the initial issuance of the license shall be the
average sale price for the three most recent sales of plenary retail
consumption licenses in the municipality where the license is being issued
during the preceding five years.  If the off-track wagering facility is located
within the boundaries of two or more municipalities, the highest average sale
price of the two or more municipalities shall be used.  If less than three
plenary retail consumption licenses have been sold in the municipality or
municipalities, as the case may be, within the previous five years, the
director shall obtain an appraisal, at the applicant's expense, to determine the
appropriate fee for the license.  The appraisal process shall include an
examination of previous transactions in the municipality or municipalities, as
the case may be, and shall reflect what a willing buyer, under no pressure to
buy, would pay a willing seller, under no pressure to sell, for a plenary
retail consumption license in that municipality or municipalities, as the case
may be. One half of the amount of the application fee for the initial issuance
of the license shall be paid upon the issuance of the license and the other
half of that amount shall be paid one year later.  The director shall establish
an annual fee for the license which shall not exceed the fee which may be
imposed by a municipality for a plenary retail consumption license pursuant to
R.S.33:1-12, a portion of which shall be paid by the director to the New Jersey
Racing Commission for the funding of horse breeding incentive programs;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   The fee for the initial
issuance of the license shall be distributed in the following manner:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    Twenty-five percent
shall be paid to the municipality where the off-track wagering facility is
located and if the off-track wagering facility is located within the boundaries
of two or more municipalities, the fee shall be divided equally among those municipalities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   Twenty-five percent
shall be paid to the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii) Fifty percent shall be
paid to the New Jersey Racing Commission for the funding of horse breeding
incentive programs;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   The individual
corporation or entity holding the license shall not be entitled to sell a
license issued pursuant to this paragraph, and the license shall expire upon
the closure of the off-track wagering facility;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   The director shall not
issue a special concessionaire permit for any off-track wagering facility or
premises which is eligible to obtain a license to serve alcoholic beverages
under the provisions of this paragraph; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)   Pursuant to the
&quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.),
the director shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of
this paragraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) Nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to allow the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage
Control to issue a special concessionaire permit or a special license described
in paragraph (2) of this subsection to the authority pursuant to this act,
P.L.2001, c.199, or to issue a special license to any individual, corporation,
or other type of legal entity to serve alcoholic beverages in a municipality
that prohibits the retail sale of alcoholic beverages within its boundaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Persons under the age
of 18 years shall not be permitted in any off-track wagering facility, except
in dining areas if accompanied by a parent or guardian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The commission shall by

as well as expected dates of construction, renovations and opening<b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     In evaluating an
application for an off-track wagering license, the commission shall consider
the proximity of the applicant's proposed site to other planned or existing

opinion of the commission, the establishment of the facility at its proposed
location would be inimical to the interests of another planned or established
off-track wagering facility, or to a State racetrack, the commission shall
require the applicant to consider alternative sites for the proposed facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, off-track
wagering licenses are first issued to horse racing permit holders.  Licensees
are required to meet certain New Jersey Racing Commission rules and timelines
for the establishment, construction, and operation of off-track wagering
facilities.  Violation of racing commission rules and regulations are grounds
for the commission to revoke, suspend, or deny a renewal of a license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides for the
automatic renewal, without conditions, of an off-track wagering license. As
long as a licensee files the appropriate forms and pays all relevant fees to
the commission, their license will continue to be renewed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill removes the
provisions which allow for the denial of a license renewal.  However, the bill
allows the racing commission to continue to suspend or revoke a license for
noncompliance with the commissions rules.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law also provides for
a preference system for the award of a license forfeited by a horse racing
permit holder, first to a horsemens organization and then to any other
well-suited entity.  This bill removes these provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows for the racing
commission to use its discretion to establish the timeframe for renewal of
license, rather than the fixed annual renewal under current law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies that
nothing in the off-track and wagering account law would limit the ability of
horsemens organizations to enter into agreements with horse racing permit
holders for the operation of off-track wagering facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also removes the
limitations on when a simulcasting facility can accept future wagers on horse
races that the facility will not be receiving a simulcast transmission of, or
displaying.  The facility will be allowed to accept wagers on future races any
time the facility is open to the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill reduces the timeframe
required for unpaid cash vouchers to lapse from three years to one year.  The
cash value of the lapsed voucher is divided equally between the permitholder at
the location where the voucher was purchased and the purse account at the same
location.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill reduces the
number of thoroughbred races required to be held annually at the Meadowlands
Racetrack and Monmouth Park from 50 to 25, with the written consent of the New
Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association.</p>
