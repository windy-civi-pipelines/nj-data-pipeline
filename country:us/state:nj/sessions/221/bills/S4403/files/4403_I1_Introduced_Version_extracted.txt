S4403 SENATE, No. 4403 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 19, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  LINDA R. GREENSTEIN District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Establishes rebuttable presumption that homicide occurred in this State if body of homicide victim was found in this State. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning jurisdiction of certain homicide prosecutions and amending N.J.S.2C:1-3. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. N.J.S.2C:1-3 is amended to read as follows: 2C:1-3.  Territorial applicability. a.     Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person may be convicted  under the law of this State of an offense committed by his own conduct or the  conduct of another for which he is legally accountable if: (1)   Either the conduct which is an element of the offense or the result which is such an element occurs within this State; (2)   Conduct occurring outside the State is sufficient under the law of this  State to constitute an attempt to commit a crime within the State; (3)   Conduct occurring outside the State is sufficient under the law of this  State to constitute a conspiracy to commit an offense within the State and an  overt act in furtherance of such conspiracy occurs within the State; (4)   Conduct occurring within the State establishes complicity in the commission of, or an attempt, or conspiracy to commit, an offense in another jurisdiction which also is an offense under the law of this State; (5)   The offense consists of the omission to perform a legal duty imposed by the law of this State with respect to domicile, residence or a relationship to a person, thing or transaction in the State; or (6)   The offense is based on a statute of this State which expressly prohibits conduct outside the State, when the conduct bears a reasonable relation to a legitimate interest of this State and the actor knows or should know that his conduct is likely to affect that interest. b.    Subsection a.(1) does not apply when either causing a specified result or a purpose to cause or danger of causing such a result is an element of an offense and the result occurs or is designed or likely to occur only in another jurisdiction where the conduct charged would not constitute an offense, unless a legislative purpose plainly appears to declare the conduct criminal regardless of the place of the result. c.     Except as provided in subsection g., subsection a. (1) does not apply when causing a particular result is an element of an offense and the result is caused by conduct occurring outside the State which would not constitute an offense if the result had occurred there, unless the actor purposely or knowingly caused the result within the State. d.    When the offense is homicide, either the death of the victim or the bodily impact causing death constitutes a "result," within the meaning of subsection a.(1) and if the body of a homicide victim is found within the State, [it may be inferred] there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such result occurred within the State. e.     This State includes the land and water, including the waters set forth in N.J.S.40A:13-2 and the air space above such land and water with respect to which the State has legislative jurisdiction.  It also includes any territory made subject to the criminal jurisdiction of this State by compacts between it and another state or between it and the Federal Government. f.     Notwithstanding that territorial jurisdiction may be found under this section, the court may dismiss, hold in abeyance for up to six months, or, with the permission of the defendant, place on the inactive list a criminal prosecution under the law of this State where it appears that such action is in  the interests of justice because the defendant is being prosecuted for an offense based on the same conduct in another jurisdiction and this State's interest will be adequately served by a prosecution in the other jurisdiction. g.    When the result which is an element of an offense consists of inflicting a harm upon a resident of this State or depriving a resident of this State of a benefit, the result occurs within this State, even if the conduct occurs wholly outside this State and any property that was affected by the offense was located outside this State. (cf: P.L.2003, c.184, s.1) 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes a rebuttable presumption that a homicide occurred in this State if the body of the homicide victim is found in this State. Current law provides that if the body of a homicide victim is found in New Jersey, it may be inferred that the homicide occurred in New Jersey. Thus, current law sets out a permissive inference in determining which state has jurisdiction to prosecute the homicide. In a criminal case, an inference is a deduction or conclusion which may lead the jury to draw from facts that have been established by the evidence.  By contrast, a rebuttable presumption provides that if a jury finds a basic fact (for example, that a homicide victims body was found in the State), that finding must give rise to the existence of a presumed fact (i.e., that the homicide occurred in this State), unless the presumption is rebutted with other evidence.
