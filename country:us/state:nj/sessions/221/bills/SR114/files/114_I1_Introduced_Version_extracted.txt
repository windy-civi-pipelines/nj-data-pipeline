SR114 SENATE RESOLUTION No. 114 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED OCTOBER 7, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  PARKER SPACE District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) SYNOPSIS Supports work of pregnancy resource centers and condemns harassment of pregnancy resource centers by AG. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Senate Resolution supporting the work of pregnancy resource centers and condemning the harassment of pregnancy resource centers by the Attorney General. Whereas, A woman has the inalienable right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term; and Whereas, The New Jersey Law Against Discrimination forbids discrimination and harassment based on certain protected characteristics, which includes pregnancy; and Whereas, A pregnant woman is therefore entitled to receive information and care to support her pregnancy, such as alternatives to abortion, parenting education, medical treatment from licensed health care professionals, counseling, and maternal and baby goods offered by providers of these goods and services; and Whereas, In this State and nationwide, pregnancy resource centers are non-profit organizations, many of which are faith-based, that are mission-driven, rather than profit-driven, to provide pregnant women with the care and support they need, often at little to no cost; and Whereas, In 2022, pregnancy resource centers in this State provided over $3.6 million in resources, including material goods and services, to over 23,000 women, men, and children; and Whereas, These resources included more than 8,000 free pregnancy tests, more than 6,000 free ultrasound examinations, more than 2,000 free screenings for sexually transmitted diseases, more than 9,000 free packs of diapers, more than 75,000 free sets of baby clothes, 55 free car seats, 172 free strollers, 38 free cribs, and more than 1,000 free containers of formula; and Whereas, Despite providing significant value to pregnant women and the community at large, pregnancy resource centers are under attack in this State by the Attorney General, Matthew J. Platkin, and by politically motivated Attorneys General in numerous other states; and Whereas, Attorney General Platkin is part of a group of 16 state Attorneys General, led by the Attorney General of California, that has launched a coordinated nationwide campaign of intimidation and harassment aimed at pregnancy resource centers under the guise of consumer protection; and Whereas, In an open letter dated October 23, 2023, co-signed by Attorney General Platkin, this group of Attorneys General makes sweeping allegations that broadly accuse pregnancy resource centers of engaging in deceptive and misleading conduct; and Whereas, Although there have been no complaints filed by any client of a pregnancy resource center in this State, Attorney General Platkin has issued investigative subpoenas to certain pregnancy resource centers allegedly for the purpose of investigating false advertising but which are actually a misuse of the law enforcement powers of his office; and Whereas, These subpoenas require the pregnancy resource centers to turn over, among other things, ten years worth of documents concerning their board members, employees, volunteers, donors, advertisements, and informational materials; and Whereas, The overbroad and unduly burdensome nature of these subpoenas appear to be a deliberate attempt to target and silence organizations that offer alternatives to abortion; and Whereas, Attorney General Platkins actions demonstrate a clear bias toward allowing only a pro-abortion narrative to dominate the public discourse; and Whereas, Pregnancy resource centers offer their services and donated material resources, including medical services under the care of licensed health care professionals, without regard to a persons religious affiliation or ability to pay; and Whereas, It is thus in the interest of this State to protect the valuable support that pregnancy resource centers provide; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This House supports and applauds the work of pregnancy resource centers in this State. 2.  This House condemns Attorney General Platkin for his harassment of pregnancy resource centers in this State. 3.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the Governor and the Attorney General. STATEMENT This resolution expresses support for the work of pregnancy resource centers in this State, and condemns Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin for his politically motivated harassment of pregnancy resource centers. A pregnancy resource center is typically a faith-based non-profit organization, which offers pregnant women information and care to support their pregnancy, such as alternatives to abortion, parenting education, medical treatment from licensed health care professionals, counseling, and maternal and baby goods, often at little or no cost.  Pregnancy resource centers offer their services and donated goods without regard to a persons religious affiliation or ability to pay. In 2022, pregnancy resource centers in this State provided over $3.6 million in goods and services to over 23,000 people, including women, men, and youth, which included more than 8,000 free pregnancy tests, more than 6,000 free ultrasound examinations, more than 2,000 free screenings for sexually transmitted diseases, more than 9,000 free packs of diapers, more than 75,000 free sets of baby clothes, 55 free car seats, 172 free strollers, 38 free cribs, and more than 1,000 free containers of formula. Despite their significant value to pregnant women and the community at large, pregnancy resource centers are under attack by the Attorney General as part of a coordinated nationwide campaign of intimidation and harassment under the guise of consumer protection. Although there have been no complaints filed by any client of a pregnancy resource center in this State, Attorney General Platkin has issued investigative subpoenas to certain pregnancy resource centers in an apparent misuse of the law enforcement powers of his office.  The overbroad and unduly burdensome nature of these subpoenas appear to be a deliberate attempt to target and silence organizations that offer alternatives to abortion.
