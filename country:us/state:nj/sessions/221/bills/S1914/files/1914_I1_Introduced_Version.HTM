In any case where a person who owns or leases a motor vehicle knows that the operator's license or reciprocity privilege of the person he permits to operate the motor vehicle is suspended or revoked for any violation of R.S.39:4-50 or section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a), the person also shall be subject to the following penalties: for a first or second offense, a fine of $1,000, imprisonment for not more than 15 days, or both; and for a third or subsequent offense, a fine of $1,000, imprisonment for not more than 15 days, or both, and forfeiture of the right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for a period of 90 days; i.     If the violator's driver's license to operate a motor vehicle has been suspended pursuant to section 9 of P.L.1985, c.14 (C.39:4-139.10) or for failure to comply with a time payment order, the violator shall be subject to a maximum fine of $100 upon proof that the violator has paid all fines and other assessments related to the parking violation that were the subject of the Order of Suspension, or if the violator makes sufficient payments to become current with respect to payment obligations under the time payment order; j.     If a person is convicted for a second or subsequent violation of this section and the second or subsequent offense involves a motor vehicle moving violation, the term of imprisonment for the second or subsequent offense shall be 10 days longer than the term of imprisonment imposed for the previous offense. For the purposes of this subsection, a "motor vehicle moving violation" means any violation of the motor vehicle laws of this State for which motor vehicle points are assessed by the chief administrator pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1982, c.43 (C.39:5-30.5). (cf: P.L.2009, c.332, s.1). 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases the prison time for persons who are convicted of a motor vehicle offense during a period when their drivers license is suspended for a third or subsequent DUI offense or for a third or subsequent refusal to take a chemical or breathalyzer test when stopped for a suspected DUI offense. Under current law, a person found guilty for a third or subsequent time of operating a motor vehicle while the persons license is suspended is subject to imprisonment in the county jail for a period of 10 days.  This bill would increase that term of imprisonment to a period of not less than 30 days or more than 180 days in those cases where the violators drivers license is suspended for a third or subsequent driving under the influence (DUI) offense or for refusing to take a breathalyzer or chemical test when stopped for a suspected DUI offense. The other penalties remain substantially the same as those for anyone convicted of driving during a period when their drivers license is suspended for a third or subsequent time:  a fine of $1,000 and the revocation of the violators motor vehicle registration privilege when the violations leading to the suspension are for the same offense.
