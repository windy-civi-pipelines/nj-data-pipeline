STATEMENT This FY 2024 supplemental appropriation provides $3.6 million to the Department of Human Services to increase the adult medical day care Medicaid per diem rate by four percent from $89.55 to $93.10.  Adult medical day care services provide medically necessary services in an ambulatory care setting to individuals who are nonresidents of the facility, and who, due to their physical or cognitive impairment, require such services in order to live in the community. Under the annual Appropriations Act, the adult medical day care per diem rate was increased from $78.50 to $82 in FY 2021, from $82 to $86.10 in FY 2022, and from $86.10 to the current rate, $89.55, in FY 2024. Prior to these increases, the per diem rate was static at $78.50 since FY 2012. Despite these rate changes, the financial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have forced many providers of adult medical day care services to close their centers due to a reduction in income.  It is the sponsors goal that this additional funding will stabilize these essential service providers in order to ensure that New Jerseys most vulnerable residents can access the medical supports they need to continue to thrive in a community setting.
