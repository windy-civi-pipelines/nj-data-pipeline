STATEMENT This bill allows a water public utility, as that term is defined in the bill, to provide a wireless communications service provider with non-discriminatory access to any water tower owned or controlled by the water public utility for the installation of wireless communications equipment.  Consistent with federal law, a water public utility may deny a wireless communications service provider access to its water tower, on a non-discriminatory basis, where there is insufficient space and for reasons of safety and structural integrity of the water tower based on generally accepted engineering principles. The bill provides that, in approving a water public utilitys tariff, the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) is to consider 50 percent of any rental income received by the water public utility for the leasing of space on its water tower to a wireless communications service provider as above the line income. The BPU is to consider the remainder of that rental income as below the line income.
