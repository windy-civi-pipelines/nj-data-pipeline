affordable housing and supplementing P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The current shortage of
affordable housing in this State has forced many low and moderate income New
  Jersey residents to live in market rate housing they cannot afford but must
occupy rather than face homelessness.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    After paying rent, these
struggling families and individuals are frequently left with less money than
needed to meet other basic household obligations.  Late or partial payments, as
well as missed payments made up in subsequent months, are often the result. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     These undesirable but
unavoidable decisions negatively affect many households credit reports and
inevitably lead to lower-credit scores for these New Jersey residents.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Access to housing with
affordable rents would remedy a major cause of the financial difficulties
experienced by lower-income persons, leave them with more income to meet their
basic expenses, and help them to restore their credit standing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Those households
fortunate enough to obtain tenant-based housing subsidies, or access to
cost-controlled housing units, generally after years spent on waiting lists,
are often rejected by landlords based upon inadequate credit assessments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     These credit
assessments overlook the totality of the circumstances that confronted the
particular family or individual in question, fail to recognize that the credit
issues are generated by the very problem that affordable housing would resolve,
disregard the limited choices available to affected households, and discount
their best efforts to deal with those challenges.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Available reports,
studies and data demonstrate that, because of past and present discriminatory
practices, and the persistence of structural and intentional racism, unregulated
and unlimited use of tenant screening criteria, including those such as credit
scores and reports, and other forms of credit analysis, have disparately
impacted African-Americans, other people of color, the disabled, and other
protected classes, and have also been used as a pretext to accomplish otherwise
prohibited discrimination against members of those classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    It is in the interest of
the public to ensure that low- and moderate-income persons are not unfairly
denied the opportunity to obtain housing they can afford and desperately need. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     It is also in the
public interest to establish, in relation to housing subsidy and affordable
housing programs, fair and just standards and guidelines for credit evaluation
and the use of credit scores, credit reports, and related assessments of
creditworthiness or fitness to be a tenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    For the purposes of
P.L.      , c.     (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      Ability
to pay rent means: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      a.   for
federal, State or local voucher holders, or applicants for project-based deep
subsidy units, that the gross monthly household income of the affordable
housing applicant is equal to or exceeds 2.5 times the share or portion of the
total monthly rent that the tenant shall be required to pay; multipliers based
upon the total rent for the dwelling unit, including both the tenants share of
the rent and the subsidized portion of the rent, shall not be permitted; and </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      b.   for
all other dwelling units limited to occupancy by low or moderate income
households, that the gross monthly household income of the affordable housing
applicant is equal to or exceeds 2 times the amount of the monthly rent the
household will be required to pay; provided, however, that the required amount
of income needed if the applicant is certified as income eligible for a
particular dwelling unit pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Uniform Housing
Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage
Finance Agency</span> <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>shall be in accordance
with those provisions, or, in the case of an applicant with a disability, shall
be the amount required in order to provide a reasonable accommodation pursuant
to the &quot;Law Against Discrimination,&quot; P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et
seq.), the federal &quot;Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,&quot; (42 U.S.C.
s.3601 et seq.) or other applicable statute or regulation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      Affordable
housing applicant means a low or moderate income household that possesses a
State or federal tenant-based housing subsidy; or a household that applies to
lease any rental dwelling unit that is restricted to occupancy by low or
moderate income households pursuant to any State or federal affordable housing
or subsidy program, including but not limited to the &quot;Fair Housing
Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), and any low or moderate
income housing mandated pursuant to a court order or settlement.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      Credit
or other risk score or assessment means a number or other form of rating that
is derived from an algorithm, computer application, model, or other process
that is based in whole or in part on credit information, court records or
similar data, and which purports to characterize or categorize a persons
creditworthiness, fitness to be a tenant, or other position or status.  The
term includes but is not limited to FICO or other credit scores, tenant scores,
insurance scores or other enumerations.  The term also includes the use of

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would supplement the
&quot;Law Against Discrimination,&quot; P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), to
establish guidelines for determining the creditworthiness of applicants seeking
to rent affordable housing units.  The critical shortage of affordable housing
in New Jersey has forced many low- and moderate-income households to reside in
market-rate housing they cannot afford but must occupy to avoid homelessness. 
These struggling families and individuals are frequently left with less money
than needed to meet other basic household obligations.  Late or partial
payments, as well as missed payments made up in subsequent months, are often
the result.  These undesirable but unavoidable decisions negatively affect the
households credit reports and inevitably lead to lower-credit scores.  As a
result, many in the State are coping with damaged credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Except in the specific
circumstances provided in the bill, the bill would prohibit landlords from
considering credit scores and other risk scores or assessments when determining
the creditworthiness of a rental housing applicant who is the holder of a State
or federal tenant-based housing subsidy.  The bill provides that the
consideration of negative credit history for such rental housing applicants
would only be permitted if the tenant has, within the previous three years and
while in receipt of a rental subsidy, failed on two or more occasions to pay
the unsubsidized tenant share of the monthly rent in accordance with a rental
agreement.  Prior to making the decision to deny such an applicant, the bill
would require the landlord to conduct an individualized assessment of the
specific facts and circumstances surrounding the failures to pay.  After a
review of the circumstances, the holder of the State or federal tenant-based
housing subsidy would still be deemed creditworthy if the tenant has a bona
fide reason for late rental payments.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Regarding other applicants for
affordable rental housing who do not hold State or federal tenant-based housing
subsidies, the bill would only permit the landlord to assess the applicants
creditworthiness if the landlord also conducts an individualized assessment of
the applicants income, employment, payment, and credit history.  The
individualized assessment would include, at a minimum, an evaluation of the
following factors: employment history and wage history, especially the amount
of household income in relation to the cost of living in the region; rent or
mortgage and utility payment history; health history, including any health
issues affecting other members of the applicant household; the need for a reasonable
accommodation in the case of a household which includes a person with a
disability; and the extent to which the household attempted and was able to
develop a budget or payment plan that enabled it to meet most of its expenses
most of the time, keeping payments of expenses as close to current as was
reasonably possible, and considering the occurrence of unanticipated problems,
and emergencies or other factors that significantly affected the household's
ability to adhere to any such budget.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill would
require that, for the purposes of evaluating the creditworthiness of an
affordable housing applicant, there would be a rebuttable presumption that the
applicant household is creditworthy if (1) the applicant household has
demonstrated an ability to pay rent, as defined in the bill, (2) a member of
the household has a history of regular employment or has been in receipt of
another source of regular income, and (3) despite a household income that in
the past was, for a period of time, below the self-sufficiency level or was
otherwise inadequate to meet its basic needs, the household made a good faith
effort to meet its regular rent or mortgage obligations and other household
expenses, and was able to do so most of the time.  An affordable housing
applicant who has completed a credit counseling or debt management course
certified by the Department of Community Affairs would also be presumed
creditworthy, provided that the applicant household has demonstrated an ability
to pay rent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill further directs that,
if a landlord denies a rental housing application from an affordable housing
applicant, approves an application with conditions that exceed reasonable
conditions routinely imposed upon a prospective tenant, or takes any other adverse
action, then the landlord would be required to provide a written notice of the
adverse action to the applicant.  <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The adverse
action notice would disclose any screening information about the applicant
accessed by the landlord, and append any screening report that the landlord
accessed.  The adverse action notice would include the findings as to each of
the factors that are required for consideration in the individualized
assessment.  An adverse action notice that does not include a specific finding
as to each factor or that does not consider the facts and circumstances
relevant to the particular applicant would be deemed presumptively invalid and
would not be considered to constitute a lawful basis upon which to take adverse
action against an applicant.  The bill requires the notices to be printed in
both the English and Spanish languages and given to the applicants.  In any
county in which the Language Access Plan of the Department of Community of
Affairs indicates that five percent or more of the residents primary language
is any language other than English or Spanish, all written notices in that
county would also be printed in that additional language.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     The
bill requires each landlord that denies, or takes any adverse action against,
any applicant for creditworthiness reasons to submit to the Attorney General,
on an annual basis, a report that contains the following information for the
preceding 12-month reporting period:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     (1)

Civil Rights would be authorized by the bill to prohibit the landlord from

investigation of the claim.</p>
