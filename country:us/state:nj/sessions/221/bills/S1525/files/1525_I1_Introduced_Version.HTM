STATEMENT This bill decreases the penalty for certain parole violations committed by an adult parolee. Under the bill, the term of re-incarceration for certain technical parole violations by a parolee who is 26 year of age or older would be reduced from 12 months to 9 months. Currently, only young adult parolees, ages 18 to 25, are subject to re-incarceration for a period of nine months for certain parole violations. Under current Department of Corrections regulations, adult parolees may have their parole revoked and be sentenced to 12 months re-incarceration if they fail to: (1) report to their parole officer; (2) comply with a special condition of parole; or (3) refrain from using a controlled dangerous substance or analog (CDS). This 12-month period may be increased or decreased by up to three months in the case of an adult inmate if, in the opinion of a two-member board panel, the circumstances of the parole violation and the characteristics and past record of the adult inmate warrant an adjustment. Under the bill, the period of re-incarceration would be reduced from 12 to nine months for failure to report to the parole officer or for failure to comply with a special condition of parole.  The period also would be reduced for failure to refrain from using a CDS if a two-member board panel determines the parolee is addicted to the CDS.
