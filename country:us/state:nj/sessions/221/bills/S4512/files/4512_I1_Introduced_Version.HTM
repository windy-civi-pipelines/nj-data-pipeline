According to the National Children's Alliance, the national accrediting organization for child advocacy centers, there are now more than [770] 900 centers nationwide and 21 centers in New Jersey, and, as of 2009, there were over 900 multidisciplinary teams throughout the United States. f.  In order to ensure the effective, efficient, and consistent delivery of services to the survivors of child abuse and neglect and their families, it is necessary to establish [a certification] an annual progress review program for the State's child advocacy centers and multidisciplinary teams to qualify for available funding through the provisions of P.L.2017, c.90 (C.9:6-8.107 et seq.). g.  Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to create a [certification] an annual progress review program for the State's child advocacy centers and multidisciplinary teams through the adoption and implementation of guidelines of practice consistent with the accreditation standards developed by the National Children's Alliance, or its successor.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.90, s.7) 7.  (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  The National Childrens Alliance estimates that 25 percent of cases seen at child advocacy centers involved a youth who either engaged in or was impacted by problematic sexual behavior.  In New Jersey, regional diagnostic and treatment centers report this represents between 15 and 30 percent of all cases treated by the centers. b.  In these cases, both the youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior require access to treatment and services to promote their healing and prevent future problematic behaviors. c.  In February 2022, the Problematic Sexual Behavior Workgroup was established in coordination with the Department of Children and Families and various stakeholders including, but not limited to, State governmental agencies, child advocacy centers, regional diagnostic and treatment centers, law enforcement agencies, and victim advocacy groups. d.  The Workgroup was tasked with creating a framework to address the need for youth involved in cases of problematic sexual behavior to have access to appropriate medical and mental health services by instituting a Statewide coordinated response to such cases. e.  Over the course of a year, the workgroup met regularly collecting research, speaking with other states, conducting surveys of professionals involved in, and families impacted by, problematic sexual behavior, and published a report describing the framework it created for a Statewide response to cases involving problematic sexual behavior. f.  The framework included creating a problematic sexual behavior program to provide oversight of the Statewide response to problematic sexual behavior cases and the establishment of the Child Treatment Assistance Fund. g.  The fund received an initial $2.5 million from the Department of Children and Families to cover medical and mental health expenses for youth referred to medical and mental health services through the program. h.  Additional monies were allocated to the fund through the States Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025 budgets to support the creation of specialized positions throughout the State to provide information on, and refer children and families to, available medical and mental health services for youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior. i.  The framework created by the workgroup also recommended: creating a screening and referral process by which cases involving youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families; establishing a specialized assessment team within the State Central Registry to refer youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families to treatment and other appropriate services; providing regular training in evidence-based treatment and prevention modalities for mental health providers; and providing training, support and technical assistance to the professionals and stakeholders involved in the Statewide response to cases involving problematic sexual behavior. j.  Since the publication of the Workgroups report, the Department of Children and Families and the Child Advocacy Center-Multidisciplinary Team Advisory Board established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2107, c.90 (C.9:6-8.19) have worked to implement its recommendations and institute a sustainable referral and treatment process for youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behaviors and their families. k.  Therefore, it is the Legislatures intent to codify the efforts of the department and the board to ensure that the framework created by the Problematic Sexual Behavior Workgroup to treat and provide services to youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families is permanently established in law and supported by the current and all future administrations. 8.  (New section)  a.  There is established, in but not of the Department of Children and Families, the Problematic Sexual Behavior Program.  The program shall be administered by the New Jersey Childrens Alliance and funded by the Department of Children and Families.  The purpose of the program is to: (1) institute a Statewide, coordinated response to reports of problematic sexual behavior referred to the program by the Sexual Contact Between Youth Screening and Referral Team established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and (2) address the need for youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families to have access to appropriate medical and mental health services. b.  The program shall: (1) screen and refer youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behaviors and their families to, and provide information on, available medical, mental health, and other appropriate services and resources pursuant to section 8 of P.L.; c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (2) develop, approve, and provide for training in evidence-based treatment and prevention modalities for mental health providers who will treat youth who engage in or are impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families; and (3) provide support, technical assistance, and training on evidencebased prevention, intervention, and response relating to problematic sexual behavior to specialized care coordinators, community leaders, stakeholders, and social services professionals who may come into contact with or provide services to youth who engage in or are impacted by problematic sexual behavior. c.  (1) The program shall select specialized care coordinators to ensure coverage of the northern, central, and southern regions of the State and provide care coordination services, upon request, to youth who engage in or are impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families.  The number of specialized care coordinators selected by the program shall be based on the determined needs of residents for services relating to, and the number of reports of, problematic sexual behavior in each of the regions. (2) The care coordination services provided by a specialized care coordinator to youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families shall include: (a) services to assess and determine the level of service needs for, and referrals to, available medical and mental health care services; and (b) providing information on and referral to other appropriate services and community-based resources. (3)  A specialized care coordinator shall be assigned to provide care coordination services to a youth who engages in or is impacted by problematic sexual behavior and the youths family until such time all requested services have been arranged for and engaged in by the youth and the youths family. 9.  (New section)  a.  The program shall form a Sexual Contact Between Youth Screening and Referral Team, consisting of State Central Registry representatives, to conduct a telephone assessment of and determine whether a report of child abuse or neglect received by the State Central Registry involves problematic sexual behavior, and whether the report warrants a referral to the Problematic Sexual Behavior Program established pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  The program shall: (1) establish criteria to determine whether a potential report of problematic sexual behavior received by the registry shall be screened and referred by the program for available medical and mental health care services pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of subsection c. of section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (2) create procedures to facilitate coordination of, and information sharing on, referrals made pursuant to subsection a. of this section between the team, relevant county prosecutors offices, consistent with N.J.A.C.3A:10-5.1, and specialized care coordinators; (3) institute a process for continued communication between a specialized care coordinator and a county prosecutors office allowing for the care coordinator or the prosecutors office, when appropriate, to refer a report of problematic sexual behavior back to the team for additional review; and (4) develop standards to facilitate the payment of medical and mental health care services provided to youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behaviors pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and their families who may not otherwise have access to such services. 10.  (New section)  There is established in the Department of Children and Families a fund to be known as the "Child Treatment Assistance Fund."  The fund, administered by the board and in coordination with the department, shall be the repository of monies appropriated to cover the cost of the medical and mental health services provided through the program established pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) to youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families. 11.  (New section)  The board and the Department of Children and Families shall promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act. 12.  (New section)  There is appropriated $8,500,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Children and Families to effectuate the purposes of this act as follows: a.  $5,000,000 for the administration of the "Child Treatment Assistance Fund" established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.   (C.)

Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  Section 1 of P.L.2017, c.90 (C.9:6-8.107) is amended to read as follows: 1.  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  Child advocacy centers are child-friendly centers where a multidisciplinary team of law enforcement, child protective services, prosecutors, mental health and medical professionals, and victim witness and family advocates can provide a coordinated response to the investigation, treatment, prosecution, and prevention of child abuse and neglect. b.  Child advocacy centers and multidisciplinary teams are designed to ease the stress experienced by survivors of child abuse and neglect, and their families, throughout the investigation process and improve methods of responding to acts of child abuse and neglect. c.  Child advocacy centers and multidisciplinary teams reduce the trauma suffered by children who have been abused or neglected by employing forensic interviewers specifically trained to work with survivors of child abuse and neglect. d.  The centers and teams also assist child abuse and neglect survivors and their families in obtaining judicial, medical, therapeutic, and victim advocacy services, and enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement, prosecutors, and child protective services professionals when investigating child abuse and neglect. e.  The number of child advocacy centers in the United States has grown dramatically since 1986 when the first center was established. According to the National Children's Alliance, the national accrediting organization for child advocacy centers, there are now more than [770] 900 centers nationwide and 21 centers in New Jersey, and, as of 2009, there were over 900 multidisciplinary teams throughout the United States. f.  In order to ensure the effective, efficient, and consistent delivery of services to the survivors of child abuse and neglect and their families, it is necessary to establish [a certification] an annual progress review program for the State's child advocacy centers and multidisciplinary teams to qualify for available funding through the provisions of P.L.2017, c.90 (C.9:6-8.107 et seq.). g.  Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to create a [certification] an annual progress review program for the State's child advocacy centers and multidisciplinary teams through the adoption and implementation of guidelines of practice consistent with the accreditation standards developed by the National Children's Alliance, or its successor.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.90, s.7) 7.  (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  The National Childrens Alliance estimates that 25 percent of cases seen at child advocacy centers involved a youth who either engaged in or was impacted by problematic sexual behavior.  In New Jersey, regional diagnostic and treatment centers report this represents between 15 and 30 percent of all cases treated by the centers. b.  In these cases, both the youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior require access to treatment and services to promote their healing and prevent future problematic behaviors. c.  In February 2022, the Problematic Sexual Behavior Workgroup was established in coordination with the Department of Children and Families and various stakeholders including, but not limited to, State governmental agencies, child advocacy centers, regional diagnostic and treatment centers, law enforcement agencies, and victim advocacy groups. d.  The Workgroup was tasked with creating a framework to address the need for youth involved in cases of problematic sexual behavior to have access to appropriate medical and mental health services by instituting a Statewide coordinated response to such cases. e.  Over the course of a year, the workgroup met regularly collecting research, speaking with other states, conducting surveys of professionals involved in, and families impacted by, problematic sexual behavior, and published a report describing the framework it created for a Statewide response to cases involving problematic sexual behavior. f.  The framework included creating a problematic sexual behavior program to provide oversight of the Statewide response to problematic sexual behavior cases and the establishment of the Child Treatment Assistance Fund. g.  The fund received an initial $2.5 million from the Department of Children and Families to cover medical and mental health expenses for youth referred to medical and mental health services through the program. h.  Additional monies were allocated to the fund through the States Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025 budgets to support the creation of specialized positions throughout the State to provide information on, and refer children and families to, available medical and mental health services for youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior. i.  The framework created by the workgroup also recommended: creating a screening and referral process by which cases involving youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families; establishing a specialized assessment team within the State Central Registry to refer youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families to treatment and other appropriate services; providing regular training in evidence-based treatment and prevention modalities for mental health providers; and providing training, support and technical assistance to the professionals and stakeholders involved in the Statewide response to cases involving problematic sexual behavior. j.  Since the publication of the Workgroups report, the Department of Children and Families and the Child Advocacy Center-Multidisciplinary Team Advisory Board established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2107, c.90 (C.9:6-8.19) have worked to implement its recommendations and institute a sustainable referral and treatment process for youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behaviors and their families. k.  Therefore, it is the Legislatures intent to codify the efforts of the department and the board to ensure that the framework created by the Problematic Sexual Behavior Workgroup to treat and provide services to youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families is permanently established in law and supported by the current and all future administrations. 8.  (New section)  a.  There is established, in but not of the Department of Children and Families, the Problematic Sexual Behavior Program.  The program shall be administered by the New Jersey Childrens Alliance and funded by the Department of Children and Families.  The purpose of the program is to: (1) institute a Statewide, coordinated response to reports of problematic sexual behavior referred to the program by the Sexual Contact Between Youth Screening and Referral Team established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and (2) address the need for youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families to have access to appropriate medical and mental health services. b.  The program shall: (1) screen and refer youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behaviors and their families to, and provide information on, available medical, mental health, and other appropriate services and resources pursuant to section 8 of P.L.;

and (3) provide support, technical assistance, and training on evidencebased prevention, intervention, and response relating to problematic sexual behavior to specialized care coordinators, community leaders, stakeholders, and social services professionals who may come into contact with or provide services to youth who engage in or are impacted by problematic sexual behavior. c.  (1) The program shall select specialized care coordinators to ensure coverage of the northern, central, and southern regions of the State and provide care coordination services, upon request, to youth who engage in or are impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families.  The number of specialized care coordinators selected by the program shall be based on the determined needs of residents for services relating to, and the number of reports of, problematic sexual behavior in each of the regions. (2) The care coordination services provided by a specialized care coordinator to youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families shall include: (a) services to assess and determine the level of service needs for, and referrals to, available medical and mental health care services; and (b) providing information on and referral to other appropriate services and community-based resources. (3)  A specialized care coordinator shall be assigned to provide care coordination services to a youth who engages in or is impacted by problematic sexual behavior and the youths family until such time all requested services have been arranged for and engaged in by the youth and the youths family. 9.  (New section)  a.  The program shall form a Sexual Contact Between Youth Screening and Referral Team, consisting of State Central Registry representatives, to conduct a telephone assessment of and determine whether a report of child abuse or neglect received by the State Central Registry involves problematic sexual behavior, and whether the report warrants a referral to the Problematic Sexual Behavior Program established pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  The program shall: (1) establish criteria to determine whether a potential report of problematic sexual behavior received by the registry shall be screened and referred by the program for available medical and mental health care services pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of subsection c. of section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (2) create procedures to facilitate coordination of, and information sharing on, referrals made pursuant to subsection a. of this section between the team, relevant county prosecutors offices, consistent with N.J.A.C.3A:10-5.1, and specialized care coordinators; (3) institute a process for continued communication between a specialized care coordinator and a county prosecutors office allowing for the care coordinator or the prosecutors office, when appropriate, to refer a report of problematic sexual behavior back to the team for additional review; and (4) develop standards to facilitate the payment of medical and mental health care services provided to youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behaviors pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and their families who may not otherwise have access to such services. 10.  (New section)  There is established in the Department of Children and Families a fund to be known as the "Child Treatment Assistance Fund."  The fund, administered by the board and in coordination with the department, shall be the repository of monies appropriated to cover the cost of the medical and mental health services provided through the program established pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) to youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families. 11.  (New section)  The board and the Department of Children and Families shall promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act. 12.  (New section)  There is appropriated $8,500,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Children and Families to effectuate the purposes of this act as follows: a.  $5,000,000 for the administration of the "Child Treatment Assistance Fund" established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.   (C.) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and b.  $3,5000,000 to fund the: (1) Statewide coordinated response to reports of problematic sexual behavior; (2) positions of specialized care coordinators selected by the program pursuant to subsection c. of section 7 of P.L.    , c.   (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (3) training of mental health providers, in evidence-based treatment and prevention modalities pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.    , c.   , (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (4) provision of support, technical assistance, and training on evidencebased prevention, intervention, and response relating to problematic sexual behavior to specialized care coordinators, community leaders, stakeholders, and social services professionals pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.    , c.   (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and (5) data collection, analysis, and reporting of information concerning problematic sexual behavior in the State. 13.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment, except that the Commissioner of Children and Families may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill expands the responsibilities of the Child Advocacy Center-Multidisciplinary Team Advisory Board (the board) established in P.L.2017, c.90 (C.9:6-8.107 et seq.) and establishes the Problematic Sexual Behavior Program (the program).
