be made to satisfy a financial commitment for services or expenses that would
otherwise have been paid from another public or private source, including, but
not limited to, Medicaid or private insurance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires a business
that has been awarded an economic development subsidy by a State public body
and is found to be in violation of the States environmental laws to forfeit a
portion of the economic development subsidy provided to the business or provide
a payment to the State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that if the
Commissioner of Environmental Protection determines that a recipient business
is responsible for an environmental incident, the business is required to
forfeit the economic development subsidy or provide a payment to the State
equal to the greater of: (1) 20 percent of the economic development subsidies
awarded to the business recipient for the tax year in which a determination is
made under the bill or (2) the total costs to address the environmental
incident.  Under the bill, these costs include, but are not limited to, costs
of environmental remediation necessary to contain and remediate the impact of
the incident, housing relocation costs for impacted residents, the installation
of air filtration and fire suppression systems within impacted buildings or
structures, and the costs of psychological or mental health counseling for
impacted residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
commissioner, in consultation with the State Treasurer and the chief executive
officer of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA), and any other
State officials the commissioner deems appropriate, to determine the amount of
costs necessary to address the environmental incident.  The bill requires the
commissioner to provide written notice to the recipient business of the amount
of the economic development subsidies to be forfeited or the payment to be made
to the State.  The bill directs the State Treasurer, in consultation with the
chief executive officer of the EDA, to provide a written notice to the
recipient business certifying the amount of economic development subsidies to
be forfeited or payment to be made to the State.  A recipient business may
choose to either forfeit economic development subsidies or make a payment to
the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires any payments
received by the State to be deposited into a new Environmental Incident
Recovery Fund established by the bill and appropriated to provide reimbursement
payments to residents of communities impacted by an environmental incident for
costs incurred to address the environmental incident.  The bill provides that
if a recipient business fails to forfeit its economic subsidy or provide a
payment to the State, the recipient business is required to forfeit all
economic development subsidies awarded to the recipient business and its
affiliates until the requirements of the bill are satisfied.  The bill also
requires future economic development subsidy agreements entered into by the
authority to include a provision specifying that a recipient business is
subject to the provisions of the bill.</p>
