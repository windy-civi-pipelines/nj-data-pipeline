STATEMENT This bill enacts Anthony Marucas Law. Under the bill, a law enforcement officer is required to successfully complete an approved educational program to administer an epinephrine auto-injector device for the emergency administration of epinephrine and provide the officers employing entity with a copy of a certificate of completion of an approved educational program. The bill provides that a police department or force employing law enforcement officers is to make available to each law enforcement officer, at a minimum, a one-dose supply of an epinephrine auto-injector device which may be used by the law enforcement officer while in the performance of official duties.  In addition, pursuant to the bills provisions an epinephrine auto-injector device is to be made available in all vehicles or medical supply kits, consistent with any standards, protocols, or guidelines established by the Commissioner of Health pursuant to regulation. Anthony Maruca tragically died at the age of 23 as a result of anaphylactic shock brought on by a food allergy.  Law enforcement officers were present at the scene but were unable to render meaningful assistance because the officers were not supplied with an epinephrine auto-injector device.  If the officers were equipped with an epinephrine auto-injector, it likely would have saved Anthonys life and spared his family the trauma of losing a loved one.  The sponsor hopes that this bill will aid in preventing additional deaths by providing law enforcement with a lifesaving resource.
