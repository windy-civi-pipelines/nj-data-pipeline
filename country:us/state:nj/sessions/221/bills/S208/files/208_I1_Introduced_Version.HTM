processes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Reuse means the return of a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  Not more than 180
days after the date of enactment of this act, each producer in the State shall,
either individually or as part of a collective group of producers, develop a
packaging product stewardship plan, in consultation with the department, and
submit the plan to the commissioner for approval.  The purposes of the
stewardship plan shall be to:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   ensure that
participating producers remain responsible for managing and facilitating the

public sector involvement in the life-cycle management of packaging waste.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    To the extent
practicable, a packaging product stewardship plan adopted pursuant to this
section shall utilize existing solid waste collection and recycling
infrastructure in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A stewardship plan
adopted pursuant to this section shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   identify, and provide
contact information for, each producer participating in the plan;</p>

list of the packaging products that are covered by the plan, including, as
applicable, the brand names of any such packaging products;</p>

or distributed in the State.  The term expressly includes:  primary, secondary,
and tertiary packaging; service packaging, including carry-out bags, bulk goods
bags, take-out bags, home delivery food service packaging, and prescription
bottles, which are designed and intended to be filled at the point of sale;
beverage containers; ancillary elements that are attached to another product
and that serve a packaging function; and any other product, whether constituted
of paper, plastic, glass, metal, a mixture thereof, or any other material,
which serves a packaging function.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of a stewardship
plan is to:  1) ensure that participating producers remain responsible for
managing and facilitating the collection, transportation, reuse, and recycling
or disposal of all discarded packaging products in the State, in accordance
with environmentally sound management practices; 2) encourage participating
producers to increase the post-consumer content in packaging products and
reduce the amount of waste generated from discarded packaging products; 3)
prioritize and promote the reuse and recycling of discarded packaging products;
and 4) otherwise minimize public sector involvement in the life-cycle
management of packaging waste.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To the extent practicable, a
packaging product stewardship plan is to provide for the use of existing solid
waste collection and recycling infrastructure in the State.  The stewardship
plan is also to provide for all of the costs associated with the collection,
transportation, reuse, and recycling or disposal of discarded packaging
products to be borne by participating producers.  The bill requires the
department and participating producers to jointly develop a method to ensure
the provision of prompt payment to counties and municipalities, recycling and
other solid waste collection and disposal facilities, and other appropriate
entities that provide services pursuant to the plan.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each packaging product
stewardship plan that is adopted pursuant to the bill is to identify, and
provide contact information for, each producer participating in the plan, and
is to also include a comprehensive list of the packaging products that are
covered by the plan.  Each plan is additionally required to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    identify the means,
methods, processes, procedures, systems, and strategies that will be used by
participating producers to:  a) reduce, through product design modifications
and program innovation, the amount of material used for each packaging product
and the amount of waste resulting from use of each packaging product; b)
facilitate and promote the prompt and efficient collection of discarded
packaging products throughout the State in a manner that is as, or more,
convenient for consumers than the other collection programs available prior to
the implementation of the packaging product stewardship plan; c) transport
discarded packaging products to authorized storage and recycling facilities;
and d) facilitate the reuse of discarded packaging products for alternate
second-life purposes, the processing and recycling of used packaging products
that cannot be reused for alternate second-life purposes, and the proper
end-of-life disposal, in accordance with environmentally sound management
practices, of discarded packaging products that cannot be reused or recycled;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    identify performance
goals for a minimum post-consumer recycled material content rate and a minimum
recycling rate for packaging products, and describe how such goals will be met
or exceeded;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)    describe the ways in
which existing municipal solid waste collection and recycling infrastructure
will be used to implement the stewardship plan or, if existing infrastructure
will not be used, provide an explanation as to why it is necessary to establish
a separate infrastructure, as well as a description of how the separate
infrastructure system will function, and an indication of the date by which the
separate infrastructure system is expected to be placed into operation;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4)    describe the ways in which
the producer or stewardship organization will work with existing waste haulers,
recyclers, and counties and municipalities throughout the State to effectuate
the collection, transportation, reuse, recycling, and other disposal of
packaging products, in accordance with environmentally sound management
practices, and identify the name and location of all authorized recyclers that
will be directly utilized pursuant to the plan; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5)    certify that the
participating producers will use open, competitive, and fair procurement
practices when directly entering into contractual agreements with
municipalities and other service providers, pursuant to the stewardship plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6)    describe the means and
methods that will be used by participating producers to finance the collection,
transportation, reuse, and recycling or other environmentally sound disposal of
discarded packaging products under the stewardship plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7)    identify the process
that was used, during the development of the stewardship plan, to receive,
consider, and implement the comments of various stakeholders, as well as the
nature of stakeholder comments received during the plan development period, and
describe the extent to which the stakeholders comments were incorporated into
the stewardship plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8)  describe the means and
methods that will be used by participating producers to facilitate public
outreach, education, and communication with respect to the stewardship plan, in
accordance with the bills provisions;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9)    describe how the
stewardship plan will be administered, and identify the staff members who will
be responsible for ensuring proper administration of the plan; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10)  include any other
information the commissioner deems appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The performance goals
established in a stewardship plan are to provide, at a minimum, for all
single-use packaging products to be composed of at least 75 percent
post-consumer content by January 1, 2027; all single-use packaging products to
be readily recyclable or compostable by January 1, 2030; and all single-use
plastic packaging to be reduced to the maximum extent practicable, or by at
least 25 percent, by January 1, 2030.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A stewardship plan adopted
pursuant to the bill may not be implemented without the prior approval of the
Commissioner of Environmental Protection (commissioner).  Not more than 120
days after the commissioner receives a completed packaging product stewardship
plan, the commissioner will be required to approve, conditionally approve, or
disapprove the plan and provide written notice of the determination to the
participating manufacturers.  If the commissioner does not provide written
notice of such determination within this 120-day timeframe, the plan will be
deemed to have been approved.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the plan is approved,
participating producers will be required to implement the plan within 90 days
after receipt of the commissioners notice or the expiration of the 120-day
timeframe set for the determination, as the case may be, or within another
timeframe agreed to by the commissioner.  If the plan is conditionally
approved, the commissioners written notice is to specify the conditions that
are to be satisfied in order for the plan to be deemed approved and implemented
under the bill, and the participating producers will be required to implement the
conditionally approved plan, in accordance with the conditions stated in the
notice, either within 90 days after receipt of the commissioners notice or
within another timeframe agreed to by the commissioner.  If the plan is
disapproved, the commissioners written notice is to be accompanied by a
detailed statement describing the reasons for disapproval.  Not more than 30
days after receipt of the notice of disapproval, the participating producers
will be required to submit a revised plan to the commissioner, who will be
required to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove of the revised plan
in accordance with the bills provisions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 90 days after approving
a packaging product stewardship plan, or any revisions thereto, the department
will be required to post the plan on the departments Internet website,
together with a list identifying the producers participating in the plan and
the packaging products covered thereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a packaging
product stewardship plan to be reviewed and updated by the participating
manufacturers, and resubmitted to the department, at least once every five
years.  However, the bill also authorizes the commissioner, at any time, to
review a previously approved stewardship plan and order modifications to the
plan in order to ensure that it is being implemented in accordance with the
bills provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Producers<span
style='color:black'> implementing a packaging product stewardship plan will be
required to engage in public outreach, to address public questions and
concerns, and to provide consumers with educational and informational materials
related to the stewardship plan and the services that are available
thereunder.  </span>Participating producers will also be authorized to provide
educational and informational materials to retailers regarding the
implementation of the stewardship plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Eighteen months after the
bills effective date, a producer will be prohibited from selling, offering for
sale, importing, or distributing any packaging product in the State unless the
producer is engaged in the implementation of, or has fully implemented, a
packaging product stewardship plan in accordance with the bill.  The bill
further provides that, if a producer violates the terms and conditions of an
approved packaging product stewardship plan in which the producer is
participating, the commissioner may order the producer to stop selling,
offering for sale, distributing, or importing for sale or distribution, any
packaging products in the State.   The bill also establishes various civil and
administrative penalties for persons who violate the provisions of the bill,
any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto, any stewardship plan
approved thereunder, or any order issued by the commissioner in enforcing the
bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Producers participating in an
approved stewardship plan will be required to submit an annual report to the
department describing the actions being undertaken by participating producers
pursuant to the plan, and evaluating the plans costs and effectiveness.  <span
style='color:black'>The commissioner will be required to post each annual
report on the departments Internet website, and will be further required to
prepare, and post on the departments Internet website, a summary report
describing the progress that is being made under each stewardship plan, as well
as any corrective action that has been ordered by the commissioner under the
bill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     The
bill specifies that any actions undertaken by producers under the bill will not
be deemed to constitute a violation of any State law relating to antitrust,
restraint of trade, unfair trade practices, or the regulation of trade or
commerce, so long as the action is necessary to plan for or implement the
organized collection or recycling of packaging products pursuant to the bills
provisions.  However, this exemption from liability will not apply to</span>
any agreement that establishes or affects the price of a product or that
restricts the output or production of a product or the geographic area or
customers to which a product will be sold.</p>
