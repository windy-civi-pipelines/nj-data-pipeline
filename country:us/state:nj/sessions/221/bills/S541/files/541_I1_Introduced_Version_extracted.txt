The bill provides that if the denial of access is due to the second exception, the owner would be required to restore access to the occupant as soon as is practicable. During the period of time in which access is denied, the owner would be prohibited from destroying, removing, or otherwise disposing of the personal property before the occupant is afforded access to the personal property. The bill further provides that an owner would be required to notify an occupant in writing within seven days of making the determination that the occupants personal property has been destroyed or otherwise rendered permanently inaccessible due to fire, flood, or other peril; recommendation or order of law enforcement, fire personnel, or any other government entity; or any other circumstances beyond the control of the owner. Under the bill, the notice would be required to be delivered in person or sent by verified mail or electronic mail to the last known address of the occupant.
