A Senate Resolution respectfully urging the United States Congress to pass the Safe and Open Streets Act. Whereas, The Safe and Open Streets Act, currently pending in Congress as S.3492 and H.R.6926, aims to make it a federal crime to purposely obstruct, delay, or affect commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by blocking a public road or highway; and Whereas, Participants in protests throughout the country have resorted to intentionally blocking roads and highways across the country in order to promote the cause for which they support or are protesting; and Whereas, Anti-Israel protests in places such as New York City and Los Angeles have created significant delays and major disruptions to the cities; and Whereas, Protests blocking streets and highways not only disrupt the free flow of commerce, but also create hazardous conditions for those blocking and travelling along the streets and highways; and Whereas, Blocked streets and highways may delay emergency personnel in responding to a crisis or cause disciplinary action to be taken against a worker for being late to work; and Whereas, Protests disrupting the use of public roads and highways require a significant law enforcement response to disperse the crowd and make appropriate arrests; and Whereas, Requiring a major law enforcement response diverts resources of law enforcement away from protecting local citizens; and Whereas, Without the action of the United States Congress and the President, protestors who block the roadway will continue to harm law-abiding people; and Whereas, Protestors need to face consequences significant enough to deter the trend of blocking major roadways, such as the penalties prescribed in the Safe and Open Streets Act; and Whereas, It is imperative that Congress and the President enact the Safe and Open Streets Act in order to address the use of protests to disrupt the free flow of commerce and to protect individuals from the danger of occupying public road ways; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House respectfully urges the United States Congress to pass the Safe and Open Streets Act. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the President of the United States, Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Majority and Minority Leaders for the United States House of Representatives, and each member of the United States Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution urges Congress to pass the Safe and Open Streets Act. The Act, which is currently pending in Congress as S.3492 and H.R.6926, criminalizes the blocking of a public road or highway.  Specifically, the Act makes it a crime to, in any way or degree, purposely obstruct, delay, or affect commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by blocking a public road or highway, or to attempt or conspire to do so. The Safe and Open Streets Act is in response to the increasing use of blocking roadways and highways by protestors across the United States.  In wake of the Israeli-Palestine conflict, there have been numerous reports of anti-Israel protests blocking roadways and highways in places such as Los Angeles and New York City.  These protests are not only dangerous for motorists traversing the roadways, but also for the individuals occupying the roadways.  Further, the blocking of roadways requires law enforcement agencies to divert resources to respond to the protest and negatively influences the free flow of commerce throughout the country. The Safe and Open Streets Act provides an avenue for individuals who purposely block roadways or highways to face the consequences of those actions.
