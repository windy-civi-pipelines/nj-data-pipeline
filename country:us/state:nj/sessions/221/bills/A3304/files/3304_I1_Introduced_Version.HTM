<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.43:21-16 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43:21-16. (a) (1) Whoever
makes a false statement or representation, knowing it to be false, or knowingly
fails to disclose a material fact, to obtain or increase or attempts to obtain
or increase any benefit or other payment under this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.),
or under an employment security law of any other state or of the federal
government, either for himself or for any other person, shall be liable to a
fine of 25% of the amount fraudulently obtained, to be recovered in an action
at law in the name of the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability
Insurance of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development of the State of
New Jersey or as provided in subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-14, said fine when
recovered shall be immediately deposited in the following manner:  10 percent
of the amount fraudulently obtained deposited into the unemployment
compensation auxiliary fund for the use of said fund, and 15 percent of the
amount fraudulently obtained deposited into the unemployment compensation fund;
and each such false statement or representation or failure to disclose a
material fact shall constitute a separate offense. Any penalties imposed by
this subsection shall be in addition to those otherwise prescribed in this
chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   For purposes of any
unemployment compensation program of the United States, if the department
determines that any benefit amount is obtained by an individual due to fraud
committed by the individual, the department shall assess a fine on the
individual and deposit the recovered fine in the same manner as provided in
paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section.  As used in this paragraph,
&quot;unemployment compensation program of the United States&quot; means:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (A)  Unemployment compensation
for federal civilian employees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B)  Unemployment compensation
for ex-service members pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8521 et seq.;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (C)  Trade readjustment
allowances pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 2291-2294;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (D)  Disaster unemployment
assistance pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5177(a);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (E)  Any federal temporary
extension of unemployment compensation;</p>

increases the weekly amount of unemployment compensation payable to
individuals; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (G)  Any other federal program
providing for the payment of unemployment compensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   (1) An employing unit or
any officer or agent of an employing unit or any other person who makes a false
statement or representation, knowing it to be false, or who knowingly fails to
disclose a material fact, to prevent or reduce the payment of benefits to any
individual entitled thereto or to avoid becoming or remaining subject hereto or
to avoid or reduce any contribution or other payment required from an employing
unit under this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), or under an employment security
law of any other state or of the federal government, or who willfully fails or
refuses to furnish any reports required hereunder (except for such reports as
may be required under subsection (b) of R.S.43:21-6) or to produce or permit
the inspection or copying of records, as required hereunder, shall be liable to
a fine of $100.00, or 25% of the amount fraudulently withheld, whichever is
greater, to be recovered in an action at law in the name of the Division of
Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of the Department of Labor and
Workforce Development of the State of New Jersey or as provided in subsection
(e) of R.S.43:21-14, said fine when recovered to be paid to the unemployment
compensation auxiliary fund for the use of said fund; and each such false
statement or representation or failure to disclose a material fact, and each
day of such failure or refusal shall constitute a separate offense. Any
penalties imposed by this paragraph shall be in addition to those otherwise
prescribed in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Any employing unit or
any officer or agent of an employing unit or any other person who fails to
submit any report required under subsection (b) of R.S.43:21-6 shall be subject
to a penalty of $25.00 for the first report not submitted within 10 days after
the mailing of a request for such report, and an additional $25.00 penalty may
be assessed for the next 10-day period, which may elapse after the end of the
initial 10-day period and before the report is filed; provided that when such
report or reports are not filed within the prescribed time but it is shown to
the satisfaction of the director that the failure was due to a reasonable
cause, no such penalty shall be imposed.  Any penalties imposed by this
paragraph shall be recovered as provided in subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-14, and
when recovered shall be paid to the unemployment compensation auxiliary fund
for the use of said fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Any employing unit,
officer or agent of the employing unit, or any other person, determined by the
controller to have knowingly violated, or attempted to violate, or advised
another person to violate the transfer of employment experience provisions
found at R.S.43:21-7 (c)(7), or who otherwise knowingly attempts to obtain a
lower rate of contributions by failing to disclose material information, or by
making a false statement, or by a misrepresentation of fact, shall be subject
to a fine of $5,000 or 25% of the contributions under-reported or attempted to
be under-reported, whichever is greater, to be recovered as provided in
subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-14, and when recovered to be paid to the
unemployment compensation auxiliary fund for the use of said fund.  For the
purposes of this subsection, &quot;knowingly&quot; means having actual
knowledge of, or acting with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard for the
prohibition involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Any person who shall
willfully violate any provision of this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.) or any
rule or regulation thereunder, the violation of which is made unlawful or the

receiving benefits, or while otherwise not entitled to receive such sum as
benefits, such person, unless the director (with the concurrence of the

paid by the individual to the division for the unemployment compensation fund,

fraud, no person shall be liable for any such refunds or deductions against
future benefits unless so notified before four years have elapsed from the time
the benefits in question were paid. Such person shall be promptly notified of
the determination and the reasons therefor. The determination shall be final unless
the person files an appeal of the determination within seven calendar days
