The fine upon conviction shall be payable to the unemployment compensation auxiliary fund.  Any penalties imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to those otherwise prescribed in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.). (g)   There shall be created in the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development of the State of New Jersey an investigative staff for the purpose of investigating violations referred to in this section and enforcing the provisions thereof.

(i)    The Department of Labor and Workforce Development shall arrange for the electronic receipt of death record notifications from the New Jersey Electronic Death Registration System, pursuant to section 16 of P.L.2003, c.221 (C.26:8-24.1), and establish a verification system to confirm that benefits paid pursuant to the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), and the "unemployment compensation law," R.S.43:21-1 et seq., are not being paid to deceased individuals. (j)    The Department of Labor and Workforce Development shall arrange for the electronic receipt of identifying information from the Department of Corrections, pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1976, c.98 (C.30:1B-6), and from the Administrative Office of the Courts and any county which does not provide county inmate incarceration information to the Administrative Office of the Courts, and establish a verification system to confirm that benefits paid pursuant to the "unemployment compensation law," R.S.43:21-1 et seq., are not being paid to individuals who are incarcerated. (cf: P.L.2013, c.274, s.5) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides that if a representative of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development finds that a person received an overpayment of unemployment benefits for any reason other than fraudulent or knowing nondisclosure or misrepresentation, the person shall, or shall not, be liable for all or a portion of the amount of any overpayment which occurred before the finding of the overpayment as follows: 1.    If the person is notified of the overpayment not later than the 90th calendar day after the overpayment commences, the person shall be liable to repay 100% of the amount overpaid; 2.    If the person is notified of the overpayment during the period from the 91st calendar day through the 180th calendar day after the overpayment commences, the person shall be liable to repay 65% of the amount overpaid; 3.    If the person is notified of the overpayment during the period from the 181st calendar day through the 365th calendar day after the overpayment commences, the person shall be liable to repay 35% of the amount overpaid; and 4.    If the person is notified of the overpayment after the 365th calendar day after the overpayment commences, the person shall not be liable to repay any of the amount overpaid. The bill provides protection from excessive repayment burdens to persons who receive overpayments of unemployment benefits through no fault of their own, especially in cases in which employers or their authorized agents fail to submit information required under the unemployment compensation law and then appeal only after a benefit determination is made, sometimes delaying action for a full year or more after benefit payments commence.

(cf: P.L.2013, c.274, s.5) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides that if a representative of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development finds that a person received an overpayment of unemployment benefits for any reason other than fraudulent or knowing nondisclosure or misrepresentation, the person shall, or shall not, be liable for all or a portion of the amount of any overpayment which occurred before the finding of the overpayment as follows: 1.    If the person is notified of the overpayment not later than the 90th calendar day after the overpayment commences, the person shall be liable to repay 100% of the amount overpaid; 2.    If the person is notified of the overpayment during the period from the 91st calendar day through the 180th calendar day after the overpayment commences, the person shall be liable to repay 65% of the amount overpaid; 3.    If the person is notified of the overpayment during the period from the 181st calendar day through the 365th calendar day after the overpayment commences, the person shall be liable to repay 35% of the amount overpaid; and 4.    If the person is notified of the overpayment after the 365th calendar day after the overpayment commences, the person shall not be liable to repay any of the amount overpaid. The bill provides protection from excessive repayment burdens to persons who receive overpayments of unemployment benefits through no fault of their own, especially in cases in which employers or their authorized agents fail to submit information required under the unemployment compensation law and then appeal only after a benefit determination is made, sometimes delaying action for a full year or more after benefit payments commence.
