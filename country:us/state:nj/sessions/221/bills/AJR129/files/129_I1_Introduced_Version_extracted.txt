STATEMENT This resolution designates the week of February 24 through March 2 each year as Say Something Week to help prevent youth violence in schools.  The goal of the week is to train and empower students to know what to do if they hear about a potential violent incident being planned.  Nearly 80 percent of school shooters told someone of their plans prior to the shooting and seven out of 10 people who commit suicide tell someone or give an indication of what they are planning.  By giving students and the school community the support and training they need, New Jersey can reduce the amount of violence in schools that threaten students on a daily basis.
