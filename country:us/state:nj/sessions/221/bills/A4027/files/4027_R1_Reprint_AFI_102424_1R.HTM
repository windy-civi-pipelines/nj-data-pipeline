shall be provided to the same extent as for other medical conditions under the
contract, except that the services provided for in this section shall be
performed at facilities that conform to standards established by the American
Society for Reproductive Medicine or the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists.  The same copayments, deductibles and benefit limits shall apply
to the diagnosis and treatment of infertility pursuant to this section as those
applied to other medical or surgical benefits under the contract.  Infertility
resulting from a voluntary unreversed sterilization procedure may be excluded
under the contract if the voluntary unreversed sterilization is the sole cause
of infertility, provided, however, that coverage for infertility services shall
not be excluded if the voluntary sterilization is successfully reversed. 
Nothing in this section shall preclude the carrier from performing utilization
review, including periodic review of the medical necessity of a particular
service, provided all utilization review decisions are consistent with American
Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines.<b><sup><span style='font-family:
