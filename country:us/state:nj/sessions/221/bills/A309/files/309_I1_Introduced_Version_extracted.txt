All public offices of State government in this State shall be open on this day for the transaction of business. (cf: P.L.2020, c.76, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill designates, as a State and public holiday, September 11 of each year as Patriot Day. The September 11 9/11 attacks were four coordinated suicide terrorist attacks carried out by the militant Islamic extremist network al-Qaeda against the United States on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Among the number of victims, approximately 750 were New Jersey citizens, accounting for the most lives lost in any state after New York. In the wake of significant fatalities, an indeterminate number of injuries, and substantial long-term health consequences, 9/11 remains the deadliest terrorist attack on United States soil. In honor of the lives lost in the attacks, many memorials have been erected across the nation as sites for commemoration and remembrance, including the 9/11 Memorial in New York City that opened on September 11, 2011. New Jersey has over 150 memorial sites statewide honoring the memory of the New Jersey residents who tragically perished in the attacks. On December 18, 2001, The United States Congress memorialized this historic event by officially naming September 11 Patriot Day to commemorate the anniversary of the 9/11 and, in 2009, Congress named September 11 a National Day of Service and Remembrance. September 11 is a solemn day not only in our countrys history but also in the State of New Jersey. Every year on this day New Jersey citizens join together to honor, remember, and pay tribute to the residents who lives were lost in the attacks. It is thus fitting and proper that the State of New Jersey designate September 11, known as Patriot Day, as a State and public holiday, in honor of the New Jersey victims of 9/11.
