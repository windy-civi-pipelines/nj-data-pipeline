(3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. b.

(1) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state.  The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states. c.

A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. d.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees. These remedies shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member states law. (2)   A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees. (3) No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the commission. Article XI. Effective Date, Withdrawal, and Amendment. 11.  a.

(3) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. b.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees.

(a) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in Article X of this compact. (b) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member states is less than seven. (2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in paragraph 22 of subsection c. of Article VII of the compact to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact. (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission. (4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commissions initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state.  Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. b.  Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the compact. (1)  A member states withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute. (2)  Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing states licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (3)  Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of the withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, the withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of six months after the date of the notice of withdrawal. c.  Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. d.  This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. Article XII. Construction and Severability. 12.  a. This compact and the commissions rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commissions rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. b. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. c.  Notwithstanding subsection b. of this section of the compact, the commission may deny a states participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of subsection b. of Article X of the compact, terminate a member states participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact.  Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. Article XIII. Consistent Effect and Conflict with Other State Laws. 13.  a.  Nothing in this compact shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact. b.  Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. c.  All permissible agreements between the commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately.
