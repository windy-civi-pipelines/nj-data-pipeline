compact is to facilitate the interstate practice of school psychology in
educational or school settings, and in so doing to improve the availability of school
psychological services to the public. This compact is intended to establish a

psychological services in any member state. In this way, this compact shall
enable the member states to ensure that safe and effective school psychological
services are available and delivered by appropriately qualified professionals
in their educational settings.</p>

other member states without first satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements;</p>

school psychologists between and among the member states in order to address
workforce shortages and to ensure that safe and reliable school psychological
services are available in each member state;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   enhances the public
accessibility of school psychological services by increasing the availability
of qualified, licensed school psychologists through the establishment of an
efficient and streamlined pathway for licensees to practice in other member
states;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   preserves and respects
the authority of each member state to protect the health and safety of its
residents by ensuring that only qualified, licensed professionals are
authorized to provide school psychological services within that state;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   requires school
psychologists practicing within a member state to comply with the scope of
practice laws present in the state where the school psychological services are
being provided;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   promotes cooperation
between the member states in regulating the practice of school psychology
within those states; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   facilitates the
relocation of military members and their spouses who are licensed to provide
school psychological services.</p>
