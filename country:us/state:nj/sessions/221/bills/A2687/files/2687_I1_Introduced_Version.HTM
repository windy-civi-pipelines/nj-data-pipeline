<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that the establishment of charter schools as part of this State's
program of public education can assist in promoting comprehensive educational
reform by providing a mechanism for the implementation of a variety of
educational approaches which may not be available in the traditional public
school classroom.  Specifically, charter schools offer the potential to improve
pupil learning; increase for students and parents the educational choices
available when selecting the learning environment which they feel may be the
most appropriate; encourage the use of different and innovative learning
methods; establish a new form of accountability for schools; require the
measurement of learning outcomes; make the school the unit for educational
improvement; and establish new professional opportunities for teachers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The Legislature further
finds that charter schools should be afforded the utmost flexibility to ensure
their greatest impact on improving education.  This flexibility will allow for
greater innovation and choice that are sought by both parents and students. 
Charter schools should be permitted to operate specialized schools with a focus
on special education.  This would benefit students receiving special education
services as well as other students through the sharing of best practices.  By
allowing flexibility with teacher certification, charter schools will be able
to more easily recruit the talent they seek.  This flexibility will facilitate
the operations of the charter school, and ultimately improve the education of
all New Jersey students.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
that the establishment of a charter school program is in the best interests of

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the Charter School
Program Act of 1995, P.L.1995,&nbsp;c.426 (C.18A:36A-1 et seq.), the
Commissioner of Education is granted the authority to approve applications for
the establishment of charter schools and to regulate and oversee their operations. 
This bill would permit public institutions of higher education in New
  Jersey to also act as charter school authorizers.  Local boards of education
would also be permitted to act as charter school authorizers, but only for
charter schools which would be located within the geographic boundaries of the
district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the
commissioner must establish an application process for the designation of
eligible authorizer applicants as charter school authorizers.  The commissioner
may designate one or more eligible authorizer applicants to serve as charter
school authorizers and must execute an authorizing contract with each approved
charter school authorizer prior to that entity commencing charter school
authorizing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner will
establish the responsibilities of charter school authorizers.  Those
responsibilities will include: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span>designing and implementing a process that uses comprehensive data
to make merit-based renewal and revocation decisions regarding charter schools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner has
responsibility for the ongoing oversight of the performance and effectiveness
of the charter school authorizers, and may at any time take corrective action
against an authorizer, including terminating an authorizers designation as an
authorizer.  The commissioner may also revoke a charter granted by an
authorizer and may review and amend charter school performance contracts
entered into by the authorizer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies that the
commissioner will be the sole authorizer option for charter schools and charter
school applicants that: 1) limit admission to a single gender; 2) focus on
providing programs and settings for children with individualized education
programs or seek to advance the skills of diverse learners; and 3) focus on
on-line learning as the primary component of their educational model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill expands the list of
entities that may establish a charter school, including private entities that
would realize a profit from the operation of the charter school.  Nonpublic
schools under the bill would also be able to convert to charter school status
if certain criteria are met, including a certification by the charter school
applicant that the school would prohibit religious instruction, events, and
activities that promote religious views.  The bill would also permit a local
board of education to convert a district school to a charter school, and the
commissioner to convert a failing public school to a charter school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An application to establish a
charter school may be submitted at any time during the school year to the
charter school authorizer.  Notice of the filing of the application must be
posted immediately on the charter school authorizers website.  Notice of the
application filing must also be provided, either through the mail or
electronically, to the school district superintendents and boards of education
in which there are students who will be eligible for enrollment in the charter
school.  The charter school authorizer must make a decision on the application
within 150 days of receipt of the application, and provide notice of its final
decision to the same entities to which it provided notice of the filing of the
application.  A charter school authorizer is prohibited from approving a
charter school application if another authorizer has denied that application
within the prior six months.  The bill also provides that certain charter
school applicants will be eligible for a streamlined application process.  A
charter school applicant will be eligible for this process if the charter
school founder has been designated a high performing charter school by the
commissioner, or if the charter school founder is designated as an approved
operator by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also does the
