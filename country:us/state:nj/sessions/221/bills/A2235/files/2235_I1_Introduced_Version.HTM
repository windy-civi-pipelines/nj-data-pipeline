Under the oversight of the department, each county welfare agency located in an eligible county that elects to participate in the RMP is responsible for determining the number, type, and location of restaurants to include as approved food vendors in the program.  County welfare agencies must consider the agencys administrative capacity, the location of participating restaurants, and SNAP recipient demand within the county in making this determination. Each public or private institution of higher education in the State that is located in an eligible county that elects to participate in the RMP must apply to become an approved food vendor in the program, if the institution operates any qualifying on-campus restaurants.  Furthermore, the institution must annually: 1) provide all on-campus restaurants not operated by the institution with information regarding the RMP and the manner in which to apply, and 2) inform enrolled students about the program if an on-campus restaurant has been approved as a food vendor in the RMP.
