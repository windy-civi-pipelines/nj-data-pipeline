Among the stipulations in the bill is that an individual is to be licensed or be issued a provisional or temporary limited permit to provide dog training, as defined in the bill.  The issuance of a temporary limited permit is directed to out-of-State individuals.  A provisional permit is intended for State residents who have not met all requirements for licensure. Individuals eligible for licensure are to be 18 years of age, of good professional moral character, as defined in the bill, and hold current certification in dog training from an approved certification program or current certification as a certified applied animal behaviorist or associate certified applied animal behaviorist.  The bill also provides for initial licensure of individuals without certification, if the individual demonstrates at least one year of performing dog training services continuously prior to the effective date of the bill. Additionally, compliance with policies equivalent to or more restrictive of aversive practices than industry recognized standards has to be proven and the individual has to affirm that they will remain in compliance when issued a license. Among other items in the bill is the establishment of: (1) the responsibilities of the board, which includes the development of rules and regulations for granting licensure through reciprocity; (2) a system directing the board on its responsibilities in the event of unlicensed practice; (3) the licensure renewal as every three years; and (4) the requirements for licensure renewal.

STATEMENT This bill creates a New Jersey Dog Trainer Licensure Board in the Division of Consumer Affairs, part of the Department of Law and Public Safety, to regulate the practice of dog training.  The board is to consist of nine members appointed to four-year terms.  No member is to serve more than two consecutive terms. Among the stipulations in the bill is that an individual is to be licensed or be issued a provisional or temporary limited permit to provide dog training, as defined in the bill.  The issuance of a temporary limited permit is directed to out-of-State individuals.  A provisional permit is intended for State residents who have not met all requirements for licensure. Individuals eligible for licensure are to be 18 years of age, of good professional moral character, as defined in the bill, and hold current certification in dog training from an approved certification program or current certification as a certified applied animal behaviorist or associate certified applied animal behaviorist.  The bill also provides for initial licensure of individuals without certification, if the individual demonstrates at least one year of performing dog training services continuously prior to the effective date of the bill. Additionally, compliance with policies equivalent to or more restrictive of aversive practices than industry recognized standards has to be proven and the individual has to affirm that they will remain in compliance when issued a license. Among other items in the bill is the establishment of: (1) the responsibilities of the board, which includes the development of rules and regulations for granting licensure through reciprocity; (2) a system directing the board on its responsibilities in the event of unlicensed practice; (3) the licensure renewal as every three years; and (4) the requirements for licensure renewal.
