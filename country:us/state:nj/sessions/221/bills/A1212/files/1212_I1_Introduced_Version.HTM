<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill creates a New
Jersey Dog Trainer Licensure Board in the Division of Consumer Affairs, part
of the Department of Law and Public Safety, to regulate the practice of dog
training.  The board is to consist of nine members appointed to four-year
terms.  No member is to serve more than two consecutive terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Among the stipulations in the
bill is that an individual is to be licensed or be issued a provisional or
temporary limited permit to provide dog training, as defined in the bill.  The
issuance of a temporary limited permit is directed to out-of-State
individuals.  A provisional permit is intended for State residents who have not
met all requirements for licensure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Individuals eligible for
licensure are to be 18 years of age, of good professional moral character, as
defined in the bill, and hold current certification in dog training from an
approved certification program or current certification as a certified applied
animal behaviorist or associate certified applied animal behaviorist.  The bill
also provides for initial licensure of individuals without certification, if
the individual demonstrates at least one year of performing dog training
services continuously prior to the effective date of the bill. Additionally,
compliance with policies equivalent to or more restrictive of aversive
practices than industry recognized standards has to be proven and the
individual has to affirm that they will remain in compliance when issued a
license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Among other items in the bill
is the establishment of: (1) the responsibilities of the board, which includes
the development of rules and regulations for granting licensure through
reciprocity; (2) a system directing the board on its responsibilities in the
event of unlicensed practice; (3) the licensure renewal as every three years;
and (4) the requirements for licensure renewal. </p>
