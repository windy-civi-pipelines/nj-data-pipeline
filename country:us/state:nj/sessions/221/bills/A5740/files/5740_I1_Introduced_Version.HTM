the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) a. In
accordance with the provisions of this section, a law enforcement officer shall
conduct a domestic violence risk assessment of any person who the officer has
reasonable cause to believe is a victim of a crime or offense involving
domestic violence as defined in subsection d. of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261
(C.2C:25-19), and who agrees to participate in the risk assessment.  Prior to
conducting the risk assessment, the officer shall seek the persons agreement
to participate by informing the person of the purpose of the assessment, how
the information will be collected and used, and who will have access to the
information.  In all cases involving suspected or alleged domestic violence,
the officer shall determine if the potential victim is in immediate need of
services provided by a domestic crisis team or other services available to
victims of domestic violence, and shall facilitate the provision of such
services.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1) Unless and until an
alternative assessment instrument is approved by the Attorney General pursuant
to this section, the Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA)
instrument, developed by the Behavioural Sciences and Analysis Section of the
Ontario Provincial Police and the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care, shall
be the approved domestic violence risk assessment instrument utilized by a law
enforcement officer pursuant to subsection a. of this section and shall be
conducted with the consent of the alleged victim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) The Attorney General may
adopt an alternative domestic violence risk assessment instrument in the
future, provided the alternative approved assessment tool is an objective,
standardized, and evidence-based domestic violence risk assessment instrument. 
The alternative approved risk assessment instrument shall generate a score or
rating that indicates an elevated risk that an alleged victim of domestic
violence will suffer serious bodily injury or death as a result of a future act
of domestic violence.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     An alternative approved
domestic violence risk assessment instrument shall be based on information
deemed relevant by the Attorney General which shall include, but not be limited
to: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the date of all recent
acts of domestic violence using a calendar provided by the officer to the
victim to identify or approximate the date of all recent acts; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   for each recent act of
domestic violence:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   a description of each
act including the type of physical violence used, if any; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   whether any injuries
were sustained by the alleged victim; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   whether the act involved
the use of, or threat to use a firearm or other weapon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    If an approved risk
assessment generates a score or rating that indicates an elevated risk of
serious bodily injury or death to an alleged victim, the law enforcement
officer shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   notify the alleged
victim that the score generated by the assessment indicates the victim is at an
elevated risk of serious bodily injury or death; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   with the consent of the
alleged victim, in accordance with rules promulgated by the Attorney General,
facilitate the provision of immediate assistance to the alleged victim through
a domestic crisis team or other services available to victims of domestic
violence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The Attorney General
shall promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill codifies the
Attorney General directive that requires law enforcement officers to conduct a
risk assessment of victims of domestic violence and provide assistance to
victims; and requires the court to consider the results of the domestic
violence risk assessment instrument in conjunction with the general pretrial
risk assessment required under the States criminal justice reform law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, pursuant to
Attorney General Law Enforcement Directive 2016-6 v3.0 (AG Directive), issued
September 27, 2017, law enforcement officers are required to administer a
domestic violence risk assessment tool to assist in identifying the risk of
future assaults against intimate partners.  The Director of the Division of
Criminal Justice (DCJ) within the Office of the Attorney General has designated
the Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA) as the domestic violence
risk assessment instrument to be used by law enforcement officers in this
State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
requires a law enforcement officer to conduct the ODARA, or an alternative
approved risk assessment, of any person who the officer has reasonable cause to
believe is a victim of domestic violence.  The risk assessment is to be
conducted with the consent of the alleged victim.  The bill sets forth criteria
for approving an alternative assessment instrument should the Attorney General
decide in the future to no longer use ODARA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The risk assessment instrument
is required to generate a score or rating that indicates whether there is an
elevated risk that an alleged victim of domestic violence will suffer serious
bodily injury or death as a result of a future act of domestic violence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Director of the DCJ is
required to evaluate the training related to ODARA in addition to other
domestic violence training already required by statute.  In the event an
alternative assessment instrument is approved in the future by the Attorney
General in accordance with the provisions of the bill, within 60 days of the
approval of an alternative assessment instrument, the Director is required to develop
and approve a training course and curriculum for the implementation of the
alternative assessment instrument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An approved instrument is to
be based on information deemed relevant by the Attorney General which is to
include, but not be limited to: </p>

involved the use of, or threat to use a firearm or other weapon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the risk assessment
generates a score or rating that indicates an elevated risk of serious bodily
injury or death to an alleged victim, the law enforcement officer is required
to: notify the victim that the score generated indicates there is an elevated
risk; and, with the consent of the alleged victim, facilitate the provisions of
immediate assistance through a domestic crisis team or other services available
to victims of domestic violence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the
Attorney General to incorporate into the current domestic violence curriculum
for law enforcement officers training on how to conduct the risk assessment,
and how to notify and facilitate access to services for alleged victims who are
deemed to be at an elevated risk of harm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to the training
course and curriculum for domestic violence cases required under current law,
the Administrative Director of the Courts is required to also including
training related to the approved risk assessment to judges and court personnel.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     According to a memorandum
accompanying an Attorney General directive related to this issue, <span

New Jersey Judiciary has indicated that legislative authorization is necessary
in order for judicial officers to be able to consider the risk assessment in
domestic violence cases. It is the sponsors intent to provide this
authorization.  Accordingly, the bill amends the States criminal justice
reform law to require judges to consider a domestic violence risk assessment
performed under the bill in all cases involving domestic violence when making a
decision concerning pretrial release or pretrial detention.  </p>
