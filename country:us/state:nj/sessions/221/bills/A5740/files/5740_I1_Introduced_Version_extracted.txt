(cf: P.L.2022, c.43, s.2) 5. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill codifies the Attorney General directive that requires law enforcement officers to conduct a risk assessment of victims of domestic violence and provide assistance to victims; and requires the court to consider the results of the domestic violence risk assessment instrument in conjunction with the general pretrial risk assessment required under the States criminal justice reform law. Under current law, pursuant to Attorney General Law Enforcement Directive 2016-6 v3.0 (AG Directive), issued September 27, 2017, law enforcement officers are required to administer a domestic violence risk assessment tool to assist in identifying the risk of future assaults against intimate partners.  The Director of the Division of Criminal Justice (DCJ) within the Office of the Attorney General has designated the Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA) as the domestic violence risk assessment instrument to be used by law enforcement officers in this State. Specifically, the bill requires a law enforcement officer to conduct the ODARA, or an alternative approved risk assessment, of any person who the officer has reasonable cause to believe is a victim of domestic violence.  The risk assessment is to be conducted with the consent of the alleged victim.  The bill sets forth criteria for approving an alternative assessment instrument should the Attorney General decide in the future to no longer use ODARA. The risk assessment instrument is required to generate a score or rating that indicates whether there is an elevated risk that an alleged victim of domestic violence will suffer serious bodily injury or death as a result of a future act of domestic violence. The Director of the DCJ is required to evaluate the training related to ODARA in addition to other domestic violence training already required by statute.  In the event an alternative assessment instrument is approved in the future by the Attorney General in accordance with the provisions of the bill, within 60 days of the approval of an alternative assessment instrument, the Director is required to develop and approve a training course and curriculum for the implementation of the alternative assessment instrument. An approved instrument is to be based on information deemed relevant by the Attorney General which is to include, but not be limited to: · the date of all recent acts of domestic violence using a calendar provided by the officer to the victim to identify or approximate the date of all recent acts; and · for each recent act of domestic violence: o   a description of each act including the type of physical violence used, if any; o   whether any injuries were sustained by the alleged victim; and o   whether the act involved the use of, or threat to use a firearm or other weapon. If the risk assessment generates a score or rating that indicates an elevated risk of serious bodily injury or death to an alleged victim, the law enforcement officer is required to: notify the victim that the score generated indicates there is an elevated risk; and, with the consent of the alleged victim, facilitate the provisions of immediate assistance through a domestic crisis team or other services available to victims of domestic violence. The bill also requires the Attorney General to incorporate into the current domestic violence curriculum for law enforcement officers training on how to conduct the risk assessment, and how to notify and facilitate access to services for alleged victims who are deemed to be at an elevated risk of harm. In addition to the training course and curriculum for domestic violence cases required under current law, the Administrative Director of the Courts is required to also including training related to the approved risk assessment to judges and court personnel. According to a memorandum accompanying an Attorney General directive related to this issue, revised Attorney General Law Enforcement Directive 2016-2016-6 v3.01, the New Jersey Judiciary has indicated that legislative authorization is necessary in order for judicial officers to be able to consider the risk assessment in domestic violence cases. It is the sponsors intent to provide this authorization.  Accordingly, the bill amends the States criminal justice reform law to require judges to consider a domestic violence risk assessment performed under the bill in all cases involving domestic violence when making a decision concerning pretrial release or pretrial detention.

STATEMENT This bill codifies the Attorney General directive that requires law enforcement officers to conduct a risk assessment of victims of domestic violence and provide assistance to victims; and requires the court to consider the results of the domestic violence risk assessment instrument in conjunction with the general pretrial risk assessment required under the States criminal justice reform law. Under current law, pursuant to Attorney General Law Enforcement Directive 2016-6 v3.0 (AG Directive), issued September 27, 2017, law enforcement officers are required to administer a domestic violence risk assessment tool to assist in identifying the risk of future assaults against intimate partners.  The Director of the Division of Criminal Justice (DCJ) within the Office of the Attorney General has designated the Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA) as the domestic violence risk assessment instrument to be used by law enforcement officers in this State. Specifically, the bill requires a law enforcement officer to conduct the ODARA, or an alternative approved risk assessment, of any person who the officer has reasonable cause to believe is a victim of domestic violence.  The risk assessment is to be conducted with the consent of the alleged victim.  The bill sets forth criteria for approving an alternative assessment instrument should the Attorney General decide in the future to no longer use ODARA. The risk assessment instrument is required to generate a score or rating that indicates whether there is an elevated risk that an alleged victim of domestic violence will suffer serious bodily injury or death as a result of a future act of domestic violence. The Director of the DCJ is required to evaluate the training related to ODARA in addition to other domestic violence training already required by statute.  In the event an alternative assessment instrument is approved in the future by the Attorney General in accordance with the provisions of the bill, within 60 days of the approval of an alternative assessment instrument, the Director is required to develop and approve a training course and curriculum for the implementation of the alternative assessment instrument. An approved instrument is to be based on information deemed relevant by the Attorney General which is to include, but not be limited to: · the date of all recent acts of domestic violence using a calendar provided by the officer to the victim to identify or approximate the date of all recent acts; and · for each recent act of domestic violence: o   a description of each act including the type of physical violence used, if any; o   whether any injuries were sustained by the alleged victim; and o   whether the act involved the use of, or threat to use a firearm or other weapon. If the risk assessment generates a score or rating that indicates an elevated risk of serious bodily injury or death to an alleged victim, the law enforcement officer is required to: notify the victim that the score generated indicates there is an elevated risk; and, with the consent of the alleged victim, facilitate the provisions of immediate assistance through a domestic crisis team or other services available to victims of domestic violence. The bill also requires the Attorney General to incorporate into the current domestic violence curriculum for law enforcement officers training on how to conduct the risk assessment, and how to notify and facilitate access to services for alleged victims who are deemed to be at an elevated risk of harm. In addition to the training course and curriculum for domestic violence cases required under current law, the Administrative Director of the Courts is required to also including training related to the approved risk assessment to judges and court personnel. According to a memorandum accompanying an Attorney General directive related to this issue, revised Attorney General Law Enforcement Directive 2016-2016-6 v3.01, the New Jersey Judiciary has indicated that legislative authorization is necessary in order for judicial officers to be able to consider the risk assessment in domestic violence cases. It is the sponsors intent to provide this authorization.  Accordingly, the bill amends the States criminal justice reform law to require judges to consider a domestic violence risk assessment performed under the bill in all cases involving domestic violence when making a decision concerning pretrial release or pretrial detention.
