STATEMENT This bill expands the scope of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman (ombudsman) and appropriates $1 million. Specifically, the bill provides that the office of the ombudsman will oversee all long-term care facility residents, not just the elderly.  The bill updates certain statutory references to reflect this change, and additionally removes references to patients and clients of a facility. Current law provides that, upon completing an investigation, the ombudsmans findings and recommended action are to be submitted to the Commissioner of Health or the Commissioner of Human Services, as appropriate, as well as to any other governmental agency that regulates or operates the facility.  The bill revises this requirement to provide that the report be furnished to these entities upon request, and upon substantiation of the report or complaint.  The bill further provides that the report may also be provided to the complainant, if the resident or the residents legal representative consents to the complainant receiving a copy of the report.  The bill provides that, in addition to obtaining the name and address of a person on a consent form, the ombudsman is to make reasonable efforts to obtain the persons phone number and email address. The bill revises a requirement for the Legislature to review the development, administration, and operation of the office through certain standing reference committees to instead make the Legislature directly responsible for the review. The bill appropriates to the ombudsman $700,000 for the purpose of employing additional staff; purchasing, renting, or leasing vehicles or other transportation; and such other expenses as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the office.  Further, $300,000 is appropriated for the purpose of undertaking a Statewide advertising campaign to promote the ombudsmans Volunteer Advocate program. The bill makes various technical and stylistic changes involving grammar and citation.

(cf: P.L.1977, c.239, s.9) 12.  Section 10 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-10) is amended to read as follow: 10.  a.  The office shall promote community contact and involvement with [patients, residents and clients] long-term care residents of facilities through the use of volunteers and volunteer programs.  The volunteers, as private citizens, may exercise, but need not be limited to, such functions as visitation, consultation, problem solving, eliciting complaints, and, generally serving as advocates on behalf of [the institutionalized elderly] long-term care residents.

(cf: P.L.1977, c.239, s.10) 13.  Section 11 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-11) is amended to read as follows: 11.  a.  Any correspondence or written communication from any [patient, resident, or client] long-term care resident of a facility to the office shall, if delivered to or received by the facility, be promptly forwarded, unopened, by the facility to the office.

(cf: P.L.1977, c.239, s.13) 15.  Section 14 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-14) is amended to read as follows: 14.  a.  No discriminatory, disciplinary or retaliatory action shall be taken against any officer or employee of a facility or government agency by such facility or government agency or against any 1[patient,] long-term care resident[, or client] of a facility or guardian or family member thereof, or volunteer, for any communication by him with the office or for any information given or disclosed by him in good faith to aid the office in carrying out its duties and responsibilities.  Any person who knowingly or willfully violates the provisions of this subsection by instituting discriminatory, disciplinary, or retaliatory action against any officer or employee of a facility or government agency or against any [patient,] long-term care resident [or client] of a facility or guardian or family member thereof, or volunteer, for any communication by him with the office or for any information given or disclosed by him in good faith to aid the office in carrying out its duties and responsibilities is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. b.    Any person who willfully hinders the lawful actions of the office or willfully refuses to comply with its lawful demands, including the demand of immediate entry into and inspection of a facility or government agency or the demand of immediate access to a [patient,] long-term care resident [or client] thereof, or who offers any compensation, gratuity, or promise thereof to the office in an effort to affect the outcome of any matter which is being investigated, or is likely to be investigated shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $5,000.00.  Such penalty shall be collected and enforced by summary proceedings pursuant to ["the penalty enforcement law" (N.J.S. 2A:58-1 et seq.)] the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), upon complaint of the office or any other person.  Each violation of this act shall constitute a separate offense. c.    The office may bring suit in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any of the powers enumerated in this act. d.    When a person has been penalized under this section, a letter making note of the penalty shall immediately be sent by the court to the licensing authority or the professional board, if any, having jurisdiction over the person who has been penalized. (cf: P.L.1987, c.104, s.1) 16.  Section of 15 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-15) is amended to read as follows: 15.  The Legislature [through the Senate and Assembly Standing Committees on Institutions, Health and Welfare, or such other committee or committees as may be designated from time to time by the President of the Senate and Speaker of the General Assembly, respectively] shall review, on a continuous basis, the development, administration and operation of the office provided for in this act.  To facilitate this review and oversight, the office shall submit to the [committees] Legislature the reports required by this act [, and such other reports as shall be called for by the committees from time to time] in a manner that is consistent with section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1). (cf: P.L.1977, c.239, s.15) 17.  a.  There shall be appropriated from the General Fund to the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, $700,000 for the purpose of employing additional staff; purchasing, renting, or leasing vehicles or other transportation; and such other expenses as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the office. b.    There shall be appropriated from the General Fund to the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, $300,000 for the purpose of undertaking a Statewide advertising campaign to promote the offices Volunteer Advocate program. 18.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill expands the scope of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman (ombudsman) and appropriates $1 million. Specifically, the bill provides that the office of the ombudsman will oversee all long-term care facility residents, not just the elderly.  The bill updates certain statutory references to reflect this change, and additionally removes references to patients and clients of a facility. Current law provides that, upon completing an investigation, the ombudsmans findings and recommended action are to be submitted to the Commissioner of Health or the Commissioner of Human Services, as appropriate, as well as to any other governmental agency that regulates or operates the facility.  The bill revises this requirement to provide that the report be furnished to these entities upon request, and upon substantiation of the report or complaint.  The bill further provides that the report may also be provided to the complainant, if the resident or the residents legal representative consents to the complainant receiving a copy of the report.  The bill provides that, in addition to obtaining the name and address of a person on a consent form, the ombudsman is to make reasonable efforts to obtain the persons phone number and email address. The bill revises a requirement for the Legislature to review the development, administration, and operation of the office through certain standing reference committees to instead make the Legislature directly responsible for the review. The bill appropriates to the ombudsman $700,000 for the purpose of employing additional staff; purchasing, renting, or leasing vehicles or other transportation; and such other expenses as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the office.  Further, $300,000 is appropriated for the purpose of undertaking a Statewide advertising campaign to promote the ombudsmans Volunteer Advocate program. The bill makes various technical and stylistic changes involving grammar and citation.
