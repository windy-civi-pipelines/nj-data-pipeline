and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, shall be allowed a credit against the
tax due pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) in an amount
equal to the difference between: the fees incurred by the qualified taxpayer to
obtain from an accredited certifying agent certification for organic

incurs fees to obtain from the department or other accredited certifying agent

reflect the period beginning on May 30, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2022;
and (2) subtracting (a) the fees the incurred by the qualified taxpayer to
