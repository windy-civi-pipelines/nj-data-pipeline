ballots and amending P.L.2009, c.79.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 17 of P.L.2009,
c.79 (C.19:63-17) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     17.  a.  The county board of
elections shall, promptly after receiving each mail-in ballot, remove the inner
envelope containing the ballot from the outer envelope and shall compare the
signature and the information contained on the flap of the inner envelope with
the signature and information contained in the respective requests for mail-in
ballots and the signature and information contained in the Statewide voter
registration system.  In addition, as to mail-in ballots issued less than seven
days prior to an election, the county board of elections shall also check to
establish that the mail-in voter did not vote in person.  The county board
shall reject such a ballot if it is not satisfied, pursuant to a comparison
with the Statewide voter registration system, that the voter is legally
entitled to vote and that the ballot conforms with the requirements of this
act.  The county board of elections shall conduct the determination of
qualification of each voter in accordance with the requirements of the
Certificate of Mail-in Voter pursuant to section 13 of P.L.2009, c.79
(C.19:63-13).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of a mail-in
ballot to be voted at a primary election for the general election, the ballot
shall be rejected if the mail-in voter has indicated in the certificate the
voter's intention to vote in a primary election of any political party in which
the voter is not entitled to vote according to the Statewide voter registration
system, and if it shall appear from the record that the voter is not entitled
to vote in a primary election of the political party which has been so
indicated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any mail-in ballot which is
received by a county board of elections shall be rejected if the inner envelope
is unsealed or if either the inner or outer envelope has a seal that has been
tampered with.  Mail-in ballots shall not be rejected due to any defect arising
out of or relating to the preparation or mailing of the ballot or envelope that
was not reasonably caused by the voters, such as a torn envelope and missing or
insufficient glue to allow the ballot to be sealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Disputes about the
qualifications of a mail-in voter to vote or about whether or not or how any
mail-in ballot shall be counted in such election shall be referred to the
Superior Court for determination, as provided under section 4 of P.L.2020, c.70
(C.19:63-17.1).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After such investigation, the
county board of elections shall detach or separate the certificate from the
inner envelope containing the mail-in ballot, unless it has been rejected by it
or by the Superior Court, marking the envelope so as to identify the election
district in which the ballot contained therein is to be voted as indicated by
the voter's home address appearing on the certificate attached to or
accompanying the inner envelope and, in the case of ballots to be voted at a
primary election for a general election, so as to identify the political party
in the primary election of which it is to be voted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The location at which a county
board of elections determines whether a mail-in ballot shall be accepted or
rejected shall be considered an election district for the purposes of
appointment of challengers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>A county board of elections
may begin opening the inner envelopes and removing each mail-in ballot from the
inner envelopes no earlier than five days prior to the day of the election.  If
a county board of elections begins opening the inner envelopes and removing the
mail-in ballots from the inner envelopes prior to the day of the election, the
county board shall implement the measures necessary to ensure the security and secrecy
of the mail-in ballots.  The county board of elections shall not canvass the
mail-in ballots until the opening of the polls for that election.  The contents
of the mail-in ballots shall remain confidential and shall be disclosed only in
accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The county board of
elections shall, promptly after receiving each mail-in ballot, undertake the
following procedures and requirements concerning the acceptance or rejection of
each mail-in ballot:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   within 24 hours after
the decision has been made to reject a voter's mail-in or provisional ballot on
the basis of a missing signature or discrepant signature, issue a &quot;Cure
Letter&quot; by mail or email to the voter whose ballot was rejected, which shall
inform the voter of that fact and provide the reasoning for rejection, and
attempt to contact the voter by telephone, if a telephone number is available. 
The cure letter shall include a &quot;Cure Form&quot; and the form shall
include the voter's name and instruct the voter on how to cure the alleged or
actual deficiency.  Cure forms shall not be referred to as affidavits or
certifications and shall not be required to be sworn;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   when the alleged or
actual deficiency involves the signature of the voter, instruct the voter that
they may cure the deficiency by completing the cure form and returning it to
the county board of elections in person, by fax, or by email, not later than 
48 hours prior to the final certification of the results  of the election, or
by returning it to the county board of elections by mail, and that the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   inform voters that they
shall not be required to submit any form of hard-copy identification document
or copy thereof in order to cure a signature deficiency, but may do so by
declaring that they submitted their provisional ballot or mail-in ballot, and
verifying their identity by either: (a) providing a valid New Jersey driver's
license number or Motor Vehicle Commission non-driver identification number; or
(b) if the voter does not have a valid New Jersey driver's license number or
Motor Vehicle Commission non-driver identification number, then by providing
the last four digits of their Social Security Number; or (c) if the voter does
not have the identification in (a) or (b), then attaching a legible copy of a
New Jersey State-accepted form of identification, including either a sample
ballot which lists the voter's name and address, an official federal, State,
county, or municipal document which lists the voter's name and address, or a
utility bill, telephone bill, or tax or rent receipt which lists the voter's
name and address; and (d) signing and dating the cure form prior to returning
it.</p>

circumstances, the cure form may not be verified or authenticated using
signature matching.</p>

not match.</p>

preceding each election to conduct the ballot processing and curing provisions
specified in this section, and shall meet more frequently as may be required by
the Secretary of State to ensure the timely processing of ballots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Secretary of State shall
prepare educational materials regarding this section that all employed county

standards for acceptance and rejection of mail-in ballots and the safe-keeping
of all materials in the case of rejection.  The materials shall serve an
educational purpose for the county board of elections and shall not replace,
supersede, or void the authority of the county board or a judge of the Superior
Court to accept or reject a mail-in ballot.</p>

must remain confidential in compliance with current law and regulations
concerning disclosure of election results.</p>
