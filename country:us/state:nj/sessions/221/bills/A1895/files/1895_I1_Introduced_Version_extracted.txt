(cf: P.L.2008, c.124, s.2) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill broadens eligibility of NJ STARS Program by permitting later entry into the program than is currently allowed. Current law provides that if a student meets the eligibility criteria for receipt of a NJ STARS scholarship but is not able to demonstrate the skill levels required to pursue courses for credit at a county college, the student will have one year to attain and demonstrate college readiness, or the student will lose eligibility for the NJ STARS scholarship.  This bill removes this time limit.  Additionally, N.J.A.C.9A:9-10.4 requires an eligible student to enroll in a full-time course of study at a New Jersey county college by the fifth semester after high school graduation.  This bill provides that a students eligibility for the program, once established, will not expire provided that the student meets the programs eligibility criteria at the time of program participation.
