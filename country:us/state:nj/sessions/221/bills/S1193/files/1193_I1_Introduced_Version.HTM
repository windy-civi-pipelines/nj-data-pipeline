a change of residence notice online as provided by the Secretary of State.  The
commissioner shall provide change of residence notices in card form for the use
of any registered voter moving to another address within the same election
district; to another election district within the same county; or to another
election district in another county for processing as provided under subsection
c. of this section.  Copies of these notices shall also be available at the
office of the municipal clerk in each municipality.  Each municipal clerk shall
transmit daily to the commissioner all the filled out change of residence notices
that may be in the municipal clerk's office at the time.  These notices shall
be printed upon cards, shall contain a blank form showing where the applicant
last resided and the address and exact location to which the applicant has
moved and shall have a line for the applicant's signature, printed name and
date of birth.  Upon receipt of such change of residence notice the
commissioner shall cause the signature to be compared with the registration
forms of the applicant and, if such signature appears to be of and by one and
the same legal voter, the commissioner shall cause the entry of the change of
residence to be made on those registration forms and the registrant shall
thereupon be qualified to vote in the election district to which the registrant
shall have so moved.  If the commissioner is not satisfied as to the signature

county, if such a notice has been sent to the voter, or who has not moved since
the previous election but whose registration information is missing or
otherwise deficient, or has otherwise failed to notify the commissioner of
registration of the voter's change of address within the county, shall be
permitted to vote in that election in the district to which the voter has
moved, upon making a written affirmation regarding the change of address at the
polling place of the district in which the voter resides on the day of the
election <u>or at an early voting site in the persons county during the early
voting period</u>.  No identifying document shall be required from the voter
for this affirmation.  A district board member shall provide the voter with a
provisional ballot, and an envelope with an affirmation statement that conforms
with the requirements for such documents contained in subsection b. of section
7 of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-1).  The voter shall complete the provisional
ballot and affirmation statement, place the ballot in the envelope, seal and
return it to the district board member.  The board member shall review the
information in the affirmation statement for completeness before forwarding it
for inspection, tabulation and notation by the county board of elections, as
provided for by sections 7 through 26 of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-1 through
C.19:53C-20).  The affirmation statement shall constitute a transfer to the
registrant's new residence for any subsequent election.  However, if the voter
has moved from one residence to another within the same election district at
any time, the voter shall be permitted to vote in such election district at any
election in the same manner as other voters at the polling place upon written
affirmation by the registrant to the district board member of the registrant's
change of address.</p>

during the early voting period.</u></p>

shall file a change of residence notice with the commissioner of either county
or complete and submit that notice online as provided by the Secretary of
State, in order to be permitted to vote.  A change of residence notice filed by
a voter pursuant to this subsection shall cause the commissioners of the county
of previous residence and the county of new residence to update the voter
registration record of that voter.  The commissioner of the county of new
residence shall notify the voter by mail that the voter is now registered to
vote in that county or, if the notice submitted by the voter is incomplete, to
request any additional information or documentation necessary to finalize the
change of residence notice.  Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to
waive the requirement specified under R.S.19:31-5 that the voter shall have
been a resident of the county of new residence for at least 30 days prior to
being eligible to vote in any election in that county.</p>
