provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting or restricting an award of attorneys fees, costs, and expenses to a prevailing municipality or municipal agency pursuant to subsection c. of this section.  In addition, the court may impose sanctions on the plaintiff, the attorney for plaintiff, or both, in addition to awarding attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses to a defendant, as and to the extent provided by applicable court rule.

STATEMENT This bill, designated the Equitable Disclosure Act of 2025 applies the same rules for objectors and applicants in the land use approval and appeals process. The goal is to make sure land use boards and other boards of jurisdictions receive full disclosure of applicants and objectors. Due process rights are fully maintained under this bill. Disclosure requirements are applied to objectors and applicants on a level playing field. The proposed legislation applies current case law and court rules for the disclosure of all interests before a land use board or court. The legislation addresses coordinated efforts to delay approvals that are oftentimes undertaken by economic competitors and are at times clandestine. The Wall Street Journal reported over a decade ago how these covert operations are proudly referred to as black arts by the groups undertaking them. (Rival Chains Secretly Fund Opposition to Walmart, The Wall Street Journal, June 7, 2010.) The approval and appeal process outline in the "Municipal Land Use Law" (MLUL), P.L.1975, c.291 (C40:55D-1 et seq.) has become a tool for economic competitors of land use applicants. The tactic is to delay final approval of projects at the expense of taxpayers, businesses, and developers.  Economic competitors who have no legitimate land use based objections to an application are manipulating the MLUL with a strategy of delay and deception. This bill does not limit anyones rights, including economic competitors, with legitimate, land-use based objections from appearing and testifying. The bill contains the following components: 1.    Clarifies the definition of interested party in the MLUL to exclude economic competition as the sole reason for standing while at the same time protects economic competitors standing as a party immediately concerned and gives them an opportunity to make their case as to how the approval would negatively impact their position on land use grounds (language modeled after case law); 2.    Adds transparency and fairness by applying disclosure requirements to objectors similar to the ownership disclosure requirements for the applicant.  They include providing: name and address, employer, affiliation with an economic competitor, who is paying for professional fees if any, and a statement on how the right to use, acquire, or enjoy property is affected; 3.    Empowers court, in its discretion, to award attorneys fees that were paid with public funds should an approval be upheld on appeal; 4.    Empowers court, in its discretion, to award applicants attorneys fees should the case be deemed to be frivolous (language modeled from court rules); 5.    Empowers court, at its discretion, to order appellant to post security (modeled after court rules); 6.    Provides planning or zoning board with continuing jurisdiction over an application notwithstanding an appeal unless a stay has been issued by the reviewing court; 7.    Requires participation in public hearing process in order to have standing to appeal to courts.

Failure of the governing body to hold a hearing and conclude a review of the record below and to render a decision within such specified period shall constitute a decision affirming the action of the board. d.    The governing body may reverse, remand, or affirm with or without the imposition of conditions the final decision of the board of adjustment approving a variance pursuant to subsection d. of section 57 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-70).  The review shall be made on the record made before the board of adjustment. e.     The affirmative vote of a majority of the full authorized membership of the governing body shall be necessary to reverse or remand to the board of adjustment or to impose conditions on or alter conditions to any final action of the board of adjustment.  Otherwise the final action of the board of adjustment shall be deemed to be affirmed; a tie vote of the governing body shall constitute affirmance of the decision of the board of adjustment. f.     An appeal to the governing body shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action in respect to which the decision appealed from was made, unless the board from whose action the appeal is taken certifies to the governing body, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with such board, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in its opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.  In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by an order of the Superior Court on application upon notice to the board from whom the appeal is taken and on good cause shown. g.    The governing body shall mail a copy of the decision to the appellant or, if represented, then to his attorney, without separate charge, and for a reasonable charge to any interested party who has requested it, not later than 10 days after the date of the decision. A brief notice of the decision shall be published in the official newspaper of the municipality, if there be one, or in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality. Such publication shall be arranged by the applicant unless a particular municipal officer is so designated by ordinance; provided that nothing contained herein shall be construed as preventing the applicant from arranging such publication if he so desires.  The governing body may make a reasonable charge for its publication.  The period of time in which an appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction may be made shall run from the first publication, whether arranged by the municipality or the applicant. h.    Nothing in this act shall be construed to restrict the right of any interested party to obtain a review by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to law, however, an interested party shall not have standing to institute an action or proceeding challenging any final decision of a board of adjustment approving an application for development unless that interested party appeared at the public hearing and satisfied the disclosure requirements of subsection d. of section 1 of P.L.1977, c.336 (C.40:55D-48.1). (cf: P.L.1991, c.256, s.3) 5.    Section 9 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-18) is amended to read as follows: 9.    Enforcement.  a. The governing body of a municipality shall enforce this act and any ordinance or regulation made and adopted hereunder.  To that end, the governing body may require the issuance of specified permits, certificates or authorizations as a condition precedent to (1) the erection, construction, alteration, repair, remodeling, conversion, removal or destruction of any building or structure, (2) the use or occupancy of any building, structure or land, and (3) the subdivision or resubdivision of any land; and shall establish an administrative officer and offices for the purpose of issuing such permits, certificates or authorizations; and may condition the issuance of such permits, certificates and authorizations upon the submission of such data, materials, plans, plats and information as is authorized hereunder and upon the express approval of the appropriate State, county or municipal agencies; and may establish reasonable fees to cover administrative costs for the issuance of such permits, certificates and authorizations.  The administrative officer shall issue or deny a zoning permit within 10 business days of receipt of a request therefor.  If the administrative officer fails to grant or deny a zoning permit within this period, the failure shall be deemed to be an approval of the application for the zoning permit.  In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure or land is used in violation of this act or of any ordinance or other regulation made under authority conferred hereby, the proper local authorities of the municipality or an interested party, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance or use, to restrain, correct or abate such violation, to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure or land, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about such premises; however, an interested party shall not have standing to institute an action or proceeding challenging any final decision of a board of adjustment or planning board approving an application for development unless the interested party appeared at the public hearing and satisfied the disclosure requirements of subsection d. of section 1 of P.L.1977, c.336 (C.40:55D-48.1). b.    The court, on motion of a defendant whose application for development is affected by the commencement of an action or proceeding pursuant to subsection a. of this section, or of a municipality or municipal agency joined as a defendant in the action or proceeding, may require the posting of security or other equitable terms as it deems appropriate. c.     Whenever the court determines in an action or proceeding commenced pursuant to subsection a. of this section that a municipality or municipal agency joined as a defendant acted properly within the scope of its delegated authority and that the challenged action of  the municipality or municipal agency should be upheld, the court may award attorneys fees, costs, and expenses to the municipality or municipal agency, if and to the extent the attorneys fees, costs, and expenses were paid out of public funds and not funded or reimbursed by an applicant, developer, or other third party. d.    Actions or proceedings commenced pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall not be commenced or prosecuted for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or costs of litigation.  The claims asserted therein shall be warranted by existing law, or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.  A defendant, within 10 days of receipt of the summons and complaint, may demand in writing the discontinuance of an action or proceeding, on the ground that the claims asserted therein are frivolous or that the action or proceeding has been commenced for an improper purpose.  If the plaintiff does not discontinue the action or proceeding in response to the defendants demand, and the court subsequently determines the claims asserted therein to be frivolous, or that the action or proceeding was commenced for an improper purpose, then in connection with the dismissal thereof, and  in addition to the security posted, if any, the court may award to each of the defendants reasonable attorneys fees and all costs and expenses of the action or proceedings, as and to the extent provided by applicable court rule; provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as limiting or restricting an award of attorneys fees, costs, and expenses to a prevailing municipality or municipal agency pursuant to subsection c. of this section.  In addition, the court may impose sanctions on the plaintiff, the attorney for plaintiff, or both, in addition to awarding attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses to a defendant, as and to the extent provided by applicable court rule.

STATEMENT This bill, designated the Equitable Disclosure Act of 2025 applies the same rules for objectors and applicants in the land use approval and appeals process. The goal is to make sure land use boards and other boards of jurisdictions receive full disclosure of applicants and objectors. Due process rights are fully maintained under this bill. Disclosure requirements are applied to objectors and applicants on a level playing field. The proposed legislation applies current case law and court rules for the disclosure of all interests before a land use board or court. The legislation addresses coordinated efforts to delay approvals that are oftentimes undertaken by economic competitors and are at times clandestine. The Wall Street Journal reported over a decade ago how these covert operations are proudly referred to as black arts by the groups undertaking them. (Rival Chains Secretly Fund Opposition to Walmart, The Wall Street Journal, June 7, 2010.) The approval and appeal process outline in the "Municipal Land Use Law" (MLUL), P.L.1975, c.291 (C40:55D-1 et seq.) has become a tool for economic competitors of land use applicants. The tactic is to delay final approval of projects at the expense of taxpayers, businesses, and developers.  Economic competitors who have no legitimate land use based objections to an application are manipulating the MLUL with a strategy of delay and deception. This bill does not limit anyones rights, including economic competitors, with legitimate, land-use based objections from appearing and testifying. The bill contains the following components: 1.    Clarifies the definition of interested party in the MLUL to exclude economic competition as the sole reason for standing while at the same time protects economic competitors standing as a party immediately concerned and gives them an opportunity to make their case as to how the approval would negatively impact their position on land use grounds (language modeled after case law); 2.    Adds transparency and fairness by applying disclosure requirements to objectors similar to the ownership disclosure requirements for the applicant.  They include providing: name and address, employer, affiliation with an economic competitor, who is paying for professional fees if any, and a statement on how the right to use, acquire, or enjoy property is affected; 3.    Empowers court, in its discretion, to award attorneys fees that were paid with public funds should an approval be upheld on appeal; 4.    Empowers court, in its discretion, to award applicants attorneys fees should the case be deemed to be frivolous (language modeled from court rules); 5.    Empowers court, at its discretion, to order appellant to post security (modeled after court rules); 6.    Provides planning or zoning board with continuing jurisdiction over an application notwithstanding an appeal unless a stay has been issued by the reviewing court; 7.    Requires participation in public hearing process in order to have standing to appeal to courts.
