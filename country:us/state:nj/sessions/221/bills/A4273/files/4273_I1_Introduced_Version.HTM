<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes several
changes regarding the coverage of contraceptive drugs available for
over-the-counter sale that are approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     First, this bill requires
Medicaid to provide coverage, without a prescription, for all female contraceptive
drugs available for over-the-counter sale that are approved by the FDA. 
Currently, the law requires such coverage to be provided by the State Health
Benefits Program, the School Employees Health Benefits Program, and other
health benefits plans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Second, the bill places
certain requirements on the coverage of contraceptive drugs available for
over-the-counter sale that are approved by the FDA under Medicaid, the State
Health Benefits Program, the School Employees Health Benefits Program, and
other health benefits plans.  Specifically, coverage of such drugs under the
bill is prohibited from requiring cost-sharing and must include the furnishing
of a contraceptive drug intended to last for a 12-month period.  The bill
further stipulates that if the United States Food and Drug Administration has
approved one or more therapeutic equivalents of a contraceptive drug for
over-the-counter sale, coverage of all those therapeutically equivalent
versions is not required, as long as at least one drug is covered without any
cost-sharing requirement.  The bill requires the covering entity to establish
mechanisms to ensure that the individual eligible for coverage of a contraceptive
drug has the option either to access the contraceptives at a pharmacy without a
payment required at the point of sale or to make a purchase of a contraceptive
drug with a payment at the point of sale and submit a claim for reimbursement
to the covering entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also revises a law
authorizing pharmacists to furnish self-administered hormonal contraceptives
without an individual prescription to provide that the requirements of that
law, including a requirement to screen patients using a questionnaire prior to
dispensing the contraceptive, do not apply to over-the-counter female
contraceptive drugs approved by the FDA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill expands the
scope of an existing public awareness campaign informing the public about the
availability of self-administered hormonal contraceptives from pharmacies
without an individual prescription, to additionally include information about
the availability of health benefits coverage for FDA-approved over-the-counter
female contraceptive drugs under Medicaid, the State Health Benefits Program,
the School Employees Health Benefits Program, and other health benefits plans. 
The bill further revises the public awareness campaign to require the
Commissioner of Health develop the campaign in consultation with the
Commissioner of Human Services.<span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></p>
