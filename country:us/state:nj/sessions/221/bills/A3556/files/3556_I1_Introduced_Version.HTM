<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
Department of Transportation (DOT) to oversee the implementation of a
paratransit brokerage program, through which the provision of certain forms of
paratransit service would be managed by a transportation broker and made
available through an interactive brokerage software.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the State
is required to provide various forms of paratransit service, including: (1) ADA
paratransit service, which is currently administered by the New Jersey Transit
Corporation (NJ Transit) under the Access Link program, which service is
required under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and (2)
Medicaid paratransit service, which is currently administered by the Department
of Human Services (DHS), through a contracted broker, under the State Medicaid
program, which service is required under Title XIX of the federal Social
Security Act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the provision
of these paratransit services would be consolidated into one paratransit
brokerage program overseen by the DOT.  Specifically, the paratransit brokerage
program would be managed by a transportation broker contracted by the DOT and
facilitated through the use of an interactive brokerage software, which would
allow eligible persons to schedule requests for service and allow participating
providers to competitively bid to fulfill these requests.  Importantly, this
brokerage model is intended to achieve cost savings and operational
efficiencies in the provision of paratransit service, which efficiencies are
not achievable under the current, fragmented service models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In managing the paratransit
brokerage program, the bill requires the transportation broker to assume the
following responsibilities: (1) maintaining a paratransit provider network for
ADA paratransit service and Medicaid transportation service, respectively, with
sufficient capacity to provide all required forms of paratransit service within
all applicable service areas in the State; (2) ensuring that each provider of
ADA paratransit service and Medicaid paratransit service is qualified to
provide the service and complies with all applicable provisions of law or
regulation; (3) ensuring that each recipient of ADA paratransit service and
Medicaid paratransit service is eligible to receive the service; (4)
compensating each paratransit provider that operates in the program; (5)
receiving and acting upon passenger complaints; and (6) divesting from any ownership
stake or equity interest in any entity or organization that operates as a
paratransit provider under the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the DOT
and DHS to develop separate standards concerning the provision of ADA
paratransit service and Medicaid paratransit service, respectively, under the
program.  At a minimum, these standards would be required to prescribe minimum
functionality requirements for interactive brokerage software to ensure that
the provision of ADA paratransit service and Medicaid paratransit service,
respectively, complies with all applicable requirements of law.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Thereafter, the bill requires
the DOT, in consultation with DHS and NJ Transit, to issue a request for
proposal (RFP) and enter into a contract for the development of the interactive
brokerage software.  After this software has been developed, the bill also
requires the DOT, in consultation with DHS and NJ Transit, to issue an RFP and
enter into a contract for the procurement of the transportation broker.  In
each case, the contractor selected by the DOT would be required to demonstrate
experience in the development of a similar software platform or the
administration of a similar brokerage program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Immediately after the
paratransit brokerage program has been implemented, the program would be
limited to the provision of ADA paratransit service and Medicaid transportation
service by paratransit providers other than county transit agencies and
community organizations.  However, within two years following the
implementation of the program, and every five years thereafter, the DOT would
be required to conduct a study to assess whether the program should be expanded
to incorporate other forms of paratransit service or to allow county transit
agencies and community organizations to operate as paratransit providers. 
Thereafter, the bill provides that the program could be expanded, subject to
the determinations of this study and the adoption of rules and regulations
effectuating such expansion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the
operational and administrative costs of the paratransit brokerage program would
be defrayed by proportionate funding from the DHS and NJ Transit, with DHS
responsible for the costs of Medicaid paratransit service and NJ Transit
responsible for the costs of ADA paratransit service.  In each case, the bill
requires these monies to be transferred to the DOT and paid to the
transportation broker.  Using these monies, the transportation broker would be
required to compensate the paratransit providers operating in the program, which
compensation would be based exclusively on the requests for paratransit service
that have been fulfilled by the provider.  Of the remaining funds, the bill
permits the transportation broker to retain such amounts as may be prescribed
in the transportation brokerage contract to support the costs of managing the
program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also amend and
repeal various sections of statutory law to reflect the creation of the
paratransit brokerage program and to allow for the possibility of program
expansion.  Specifically, the bill would repeal several sections of the Paratransit

the Regional Paratransit Coordinating Councils would also be responsible for
encouraging participation in the program.</p>
