STATEMENT This joint resolution designates neon yellow (pantone 395) as the official color in New Jersey for raising awareness of veteran suicide.  The neon yellow color would be called Vet 22 in New Jersey as it is called in Pennsylvania.  The color Vet 22 derives its name from the startling statistic that 22 veterans take their own lives each day and is designed to enlist support in the fight against veteran suicide. In New Jersey, as of September 30, 2018, there are approximately 340,560 veterans in this State, of which approximately 25,680 are women.  The residents of New Jersey have a responsibility to be proactive and help our veterans who suffer from the deepest, invisible wounds of war and conflict before these veterans take their own lives.  The health and well-being of the courageous men and women who served in uniform are of the highest priority for this State. It is therefore proper and fitting for the State of New Jersey to illustrate its support for its veterans and their emotional and mental health by designating Vet 22 or neon yellow as the official color to raise awareness of veteran suicide.
