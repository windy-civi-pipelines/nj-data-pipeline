The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under P.L.2023, c.266 (C.        ) shall not restrict a controllers or processors ability to collect, use or retain data for internal use to: (1) conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology; (2) effectuate a product recall; (3) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or (4) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the controller, or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.  Personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to this subsection shall, where applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use or retention.  Such data shall be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to such collection, use, or retention of personal data. c.

Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in this section shall not solely make a legal entity a controller with respect to such processing if such entity would not otherwise meet the definition of a controller. (cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.12) 3. Section 27 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-47) is amended to read as follows: 27.  a.         Notwithstanding the provisions of section 25 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-45) to the contrary, the director may adopt a regulation to expand the program to require pharmacies to include information about each prescription dispensed for a prescription drug that is not a controlled dangerous substance.  In determining whether pharmacies should be required to submit to the program information about a prescription drug other than a controlled dangerous substance, the director shall consider: the actual or relative potential for abuse; scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known; the state of current scientific knowledge regarding the drug; its history and current pattern of abuse, including its use to potentiate or enhance the effects of controlled dangerous substances that are subject to abuse; the scope, duration and significance of abuse; what, if any, risk to the public health; and its psychic or physiological dependence liability.  The director shall not expand the program to any prescription drug indicated for use in sterilization, contraception, termination of pregnancy, in-vitro fertilization, or any reproductive health care services as set forth in section 1 of P.L.2022, c.51 (C.2A:84A-22.18). b.    At the time the notice to expand the program pursuant to subsection a. is published in the New Jersey Register, the director shall provide a copy of the notice of proposed rule making to the chairpersons of the standing legislative reference committees on health of the Senate and General Assembly. (cf: P.L.2017, c.341, s.5) 4. This act shall take effect on the first day of the 13th month following the date of enactment, except that the Attorney General and the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill expands the provisions of P.L.2023, c.266, which requires notification to consumers of the collection and use of personal data by certain entities, and requires those entities to provide consumers with the means of opting out of targeted advertising, location tracking, and customer profiling. Under the bill, the definitions of personal data and sensitive data are amended to include data concerning a persons use of or attempt to use reproductive health care services. Additionally, under the bill, entities that control or process personal data are prohibited from disclosing such data to the extent that disclosure would be in furtherance of imposing civil or criminal liability upon a person or entity for the provision, receipt, or seeking of, or inquiring or responding to an inquiry about reproductive health care services that are legal in this State but may not be legal outside this State. This bill also amends P.L.2007, c.244, concerning the States Prescription Monitoring Program, to prohibit the expansion of the program to prescription drugs used for sterilization, contraception, termination of pregnancy, in-vitro fertilization, or any reproductive health care services.

Under the bill, the definitions of personal data and sensitive data are amended to include data concerning a persons use of or attempt to use reproductive health care services. Additionally, under the bill, entities that control or process personal data are prohibited from disclosing such data to the extent that disclosure would be in furtherance of imposing civil or criminal liability upon a person or entity for the provision, receipt, or seeking of, or inquiring or responding to an inquiry about reproductive health care services that are legal in this State but may not be legal outside this State. This bill also amends P.L.2007, c.244, concerning the States Prescription Monitoring Program, to prohibit the expansion of the program to prescription drugs used for sterilization, contraception, termination of pregnancy, in-vitro fertilization, or any reproductive health care services.
