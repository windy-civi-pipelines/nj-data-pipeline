S230 SENATE, No. 230 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  BOB SMITH District 17 (Middlesex and Somerset) Senator  TROY SINGLETON District 7 (Burlington) SYNOPSIS Requires HMFA to establish "Sustainable Tiny Home Pilot Program" in three regions of State; appropriates $5 million. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act establishing a pilot program to incentivize the construction of sustainable tiny homes, supplementing P.L.1983, c.530 (C.55:14K-1 et seq.), and making an appropriation. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The construction of sustainable tiny homes could provide a mechanism for reducing the State's carbon footprint and combating climate change. b.    It is estimated that anywhere from 25 to 40 percent of the national solid waste stream is construction-related waste and only 20 percent of construction waste or demolition debris is actually recycled. c.     During the construction of the average size house, nearly seven logging trucks of wood products are used whereas in a tiny home, only about half of one logging truck is needed. d.    The pollution associated with an average house is significant, totaling on average 28,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions annually.  By contrast, a tiny home only generates approximately 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions annually. e.     The climate change caused by rising global temperatures will likely continue to decrease the size of polar ice sheets and land-based glaciers, causing sea levels to rise and contributing to enhanced coastal erosion, coastal flooding, and the loss of habitats and species. f.     Combating climate change should be a joint goal for the State and local governments, and this pilot program is a significant step toward achieving that goal. 2.    As used in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): "Agency" means the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency established pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1983, c.530 (C.55:14K-4).

(2)   Upon receipt of a resolution by the governing body of a pilot municipality agreeing to participate in the pilot program, the executive director shall collaborate with each pilot municipality on the procedures to be implemented to effectuate the purposes of the pilot program. (3)   A pilot municipality shall annually submit to the agency public utility service records and accounts for tiny home dwelling units constructed under the pilot program during each year the pilot program is in operation. c.     (1)  (a)  Under the pilot program, the executive director shall award grants to builders for the construction of housing developments within pilot municipalities to consist of tiny home dwelling units. (b)   A grant recipient shall agree to build housing developments consisting of tiny home dwelling units constructed in accordance with the green building standards adopted by the executive director pursuant to section 6 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).
