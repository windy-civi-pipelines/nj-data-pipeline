The governing body shall exercise the discretionary authority it is provided under this subsection consistently to all properties, or to all properties of the same use type or other appropriate category. d.    A local unit shall not discontinue the supply of water to a parcel of real property pursuant to subsection a. of this section unless prior to such discontinuation the local unit provides written notices of the planned discontinuation at least 15 days in advance to: (1)   the owner of the property; (2)   the customer of record to whom the last preceding bill was sent, if different from the owner; and (3)   any tenants who may reside at the property and who may not be the customers of record.  The notice for tenants shall include an offer to provide continued water supply services billed to the tenants.  This notice shall be hand-delivered or mailed to the property, or posted in a conspicuous area of the property, and, in the case of a multiple dwelling, shall be posted in the common areas. e.     Upon a reasonable request made by an owner, customer of record, or tenant before the date on which service is to be discontinued as provided in the notice, the local unit shall offer a reasonable payment plan to avoid a discontinuation of the supply of water to the property. (cf: P.L.2020, c.39, s.5) 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require local government water purveyors to provide written notice at least 15 days in advance of discontinuing water supply to a property due to the non-payment of water bills.  The bill would also require these local government water purveyors to offer a payment plan if a reasonable request is made before the scheduled date of the water supply discontinuation.  The supply of water is a vital and basic need, and every effort should be made to ensure that there is a reasonable opportunity to address any payment issues in order to maintain water supply services. The notice required under the bill would have to be sent to the property owner, the last customer of record, if different, and also to the affected property itself, by hand-delivery, mail, or posting, in order to ensure that any tenant who may not be the customer of record has an opportunity to address the unpaid water bills.  If the property is a multiple dwelling, the tenant notice would also have to be posted in the common areas of the building.
