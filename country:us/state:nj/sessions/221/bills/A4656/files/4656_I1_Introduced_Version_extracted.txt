CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning reproductive rights, and amending, supplementing, and repealing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     All citizens of this State, and those who travel to this State for health care services, deserve the ability to safely access health care facilities in this State and the critical reproductive health and gender-affirming care services that they provide. b.    Since the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, 21 states and counting have banned or severely restricted access to abortion.  In response to that decision, picketing at reproductive health care facilities increased by 21 percent and obstructions to these facilities increased by 538 percent nationwide. In New Jersey, there has been an approximately 30 percent increase in out-of-state patients, many of whom came to New Jersey because reproductive health care services are illegal in their home state. c.     In 2023, there were 23 reported violent incidents and threats made to health care facilities providing gender-affirming health care.  Fourteen states, including New Jersey, offer protections to people who provide, seek, or assist those seeking gender-affirming health care.  People seeking and providing this care deserve to be safe and protected. d.    In 2024, the Alabama Supreme Court in LePage v. Mobile Infirmary Clinic, P.C. (Docket No. SC-2022-0515, SC-2022-0579) ruled that embryos are extrauterine children, finding that that the states Wrongful Death of A Minor Act applies on its face to all unborn children, without limitation.  The holding, and the legal analysis on which the decision was based, could impact any person in a state which recognizes the individual rights of fetuses created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) and any person who is seeking or providing IVF. e.     New Jersey has long been a state that supports, and provides protections for the reproductive freedoms and health care choices of its citizens, including the right to make the choice of whether to start or expand a family through in vitro fertilization (IVF). f.     New Jersey, through this act, will codify critical protections to those seeking and providing reproductive and gender-affirming health care.  Further, this act is intended to ensure that anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ persons cannot harm patients or providers. 2.  (New section)   As used in P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Driveway means an entry from a public street to a public or private parking area used by a reproductive or gender-affirming health care services facility;

provided, however, no board shall order restoration in a dollar amount greater than those moneys received by a licensee or his agent or any other person violating the act or regulation administered by the board; e.     Order any person, as a condition for continued, reinstated or renewed licensure, to secure medical or such other professional treatment as may be necessary to properly discharge licensee functions;

In any administrative proceeding commenced on a complaint alleging a violation of an act or regulation administered by a board, such board may issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of books, records, or documents at the hearing on the complaint.

Upon receipt of that notification, the county or intercounty medical examiner, [or] an assistant county or intercounty medical examiner, or a medicolegal death investigator shall immediately proceed to the place where the dead body is located and take charge of the body.  A medicolegal death investigator who engages in the investigation of deaths pursuant to this subsection shall obtain certification from the American Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators within three years after the effective date of [this act] P.L.2018, c.62 (C.26:6B-1 et al.), or within three years after the person first takes action under this paragraph, whichever is later. (2)   In cases of apparent homicide or suicide, or in cases of accidental death, the cause of which is obscure, the scene of the event shall not be disturbed until the medical examiner or medicolegal death investigator in charge provides authorization to do so.

STATEMENT This bill establishes certain protections for individuals seeking abortion or gender-affirming health care services, as well as certain protections for professionals who provided abortion-related health care services. Crime: Interference with Reproductive or Gender-Affirming Health Services This bill creates the new crime of interference with reproductive or gender-affirming health services. A person is guilty of the crime if the person purposely or knowingly, with the purpose to unlawfully restrict anothers access to or receipt or provision of reproductive or gender-affirming health care services or to intimidate the person from becoming or remaining a reproductive or gender-affirming health care services patient, provider, volunteer or assistant: (1)   inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury; (2)   obstructs any person seeking to enter into or exit from a reproductive or gender-affirming health care services facility; (3)   intimidates, threatens, or coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any person or entity because that person or entity is a reproductive or gender-affirming health care services patient, provider, volunteer, or assistant; (4)   damages, defaces, or destroys the property of a person, entity, or facility, or attempts to do so, because the person, entity, or facility is a reproductive or gender-affirming health care service patient, provider, assistant, volunteer, or facility; (5)   videotapes, films, photographs, or records by electronic means, within 100 feet of the entrance to a reproductive or gender-affirming health care services facility, a patient, provider, volunteer, or assistant without that persons consent; or (6)   discloses or distributes a videotape, film, photograph, or recording of the person. Interference with reproductive or gender-affirming health care services is a crime of the fourth degree, but is a crime of the second degree if the victim suffers significant or serious bodily injury.  Further, interference with reproductive or gender-affirming health care services is a disorderly persons offense if the act would cause a reasonable person to suffer: (1) damage to the victims business or personal reputation; (2) financial harm; or (3) pain and suffering, mental anguish, or emotional harm. A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  A crime of the second degree is punishable by five to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.  A disorderly persons offense is a punishable by up to six months imprisonment, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. Civil Action: Interference with Reproductive or gender-affirming Health Services The bill also authorizes a person to bring a civil action against a person who unlawfully interferes with another persons reproductive or gender-affirming health care services. Under the bill, a court may award: (1) injunctive relief; (2) compensatory damages in an amount not less than liquidated damages computed at the rate of $1,000 for each violation; (3) punitive damages upon proof of willful or reckless disregard of the law; (4)   reasonable attorneys fees and other litigation costs; and (5) any other preliminary and equitable relief as the court determines to be appropriate. Under the bill, the Attorney General may bring a civil action to enjoin a violation of the law, for compensatory damages, and for the assessment of a civil penalty against each person who violates the law.  The civil penalty imposed on each actor will be up to, but not exceed, $10,000 for a first violation, and $25,000 for any subsequent violation. Dispersal of Gatherings The bill authorized any law enforcement officer to order the immediate dispersal of a gathering that substantially impedes access to or departure from an entrance or driveway to a reproductive or gender-affirming health care facility during the business hours of the facility. Failure to comply with an order to disperse issued by the Attorney General or a law enforcement officer is a disorderly persons offense.  A disorderly persons offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. Licensing Boards The bill prohibits a board from imposing any additional or alternative penalties, in accordance with N.J.S.A.34:1-22, on the holder of a certificate, registration, or license based solely on the holder providing, authorizing, participating, referring to, or assisting with any health care, medical service, or procedure related to an abortion for a person who resides in a jurisdiction where the provision, authorization, participation, referral, or assistance is illegal. Applicability of Laws of Other States The bill establishes that a law of another state that authorized a person or government entity to bring a prosecution, civil action, or any other legal action to deter, prevent, sanction, or punish any person engaging, aiding, or assisting in providing or prescribing any legally protected health care activity is against the public policy of this State.  Further, such laws of another state are prohibited from being applied to any matter, case, or controversy heard in a State court or in an administrative tribunal of this State. The prohibition does not apply to an action founded in tort, contract, or statute under the laws of this State, or an action founded in tort, contract, or statute under the similar laws of another state.  This includes, but is not limited to, an alleged act of malpractice or negligence by a person in the persons profession or occupation. Protection of Patient Information This bill updates P.L.2022, c.51 to provide a definition of legally protected health care activity and gender-affirming health care services.  P.L.2022, c.51 provides certain protections with respect to the disclosure of patient information relating to reproductive health care services, as well as protecting access to health care, medical services, and procedures related to an abortion for persons who come to this State from jurisdictions in which these actions are illegal. The bill provides that in any civil action or other proceeding preliminary thereto, a medical provider or other covered entity, as described under federal law concerning medical privacy and security, is barred from disclosing the following communications or information, unless the patient or patients conservator, guardian, or other authorized legal representative explicitly consented in writing to the disclosure: (1) any communication made to the covered entity, or any information obtained by the covered entity from, a patient or the conservator, guardian, or other authorized legal representative of a patient relating to legally protected health care activity; or (2) any information obtained by personal examination of a patient relating to legally protected health care activity that is permitted under the laws of this State. Additionally, under the bill, a public entity of this State or employee, appointee, officer or official or any other person acting on behalf of a public entity would be prohibited from providing any information, or expending or using time, money, facilities, property, equipment, personnel or other resources in furtherance of any interstate investigation or proceeding seeking to impose civil or criminal liability upon a person or entity for: (1) the provision, receipt, or seeking of, or inquiring or responding to an inquiry about legally protected health care activity that is legal in this State; or (2) assisting, advising, aiding, abetting, facilitating, soliciting, or conspiring with any person or entity providing, receiving, seeking, or inquiring or responding to an inquiry about legally protected health care activity that is legal in this State. Extradition This bill updates N.J.S.A.2A:160-14.1 to prevent a person from being extradited to another state under certain circumstances related to legally protected health care activity.  Under current law, N.J.S.A.2A:160-14.1 prevents extradition as it relates to reproductive health care services.  Under the bill, Legally protected health care activity is defined as activity providing, seeking, receiving, assisting with, or inquiring about reproductive health care services or gender-affirming health care services that are lawful in this State, regardless of the patients location. Relatedly, the bill also defines gender-affirming health care services to mean all supplies, care, and services of a medical, behavioral health, mental health, surgical, psychiatric, therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative, rehabilitative, or supportive nature, including medication, relating to the treatment of gender dysphoria and gender incongruence.  Gender-affirming health care services does not include sexual orientation change efforts as defined by N.J.S.A.45:1-55. In Vitro Fertilization Protections This bill strengthens reproductive health care freedom in New Jersey by specifying that: every individual present in this State, including, but not limited to, an individual who is under State control or supervision, shall have the fundamental right to choose whether to use assisted reproductive technology (ART), including, but not limited to in vitro fertilization (IVF); and a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus shall not have independent rights under any of the laws of the State. Medicolegal Investigations This bill removes the requirement that a medical examiner conduct a medicolegal investigation of a death in the State related to a fetal death occurring without medical attendance.  This provisions seeks to ensure that a woman who has a miscarriage or fetal complications is not investigated or the fetal death criminalized. Repealers The bill repeals the following statutes, which have either been obviated by court decision or would be obviated by this bill: (1) N.J.S.A.2A:65A-5 through N.J.S.A.2A:65A-7 (banned partial birth abortions); (2) N.J.S.A.9:17A-1.1 through N.J.S.A.9:17A-1.12 (required parental notification for minors abortion); (3)   N.J.S.A.30:4D-6.1 (barred Medicaid payment for abortion except where necessary to save the womans life).

A4656 ASSEMBLY, No. 4656 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 25, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  SHANIQUE SPEIGHT District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Assemblywoman  ELLEN J. PARK District 37 (Bergen) Assemblywoman  GARNET R. HALL District 28 (Essex and Union) Assemblywoman  ANNETTE QUIJANO District 20 (Union) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblyman Venezia, Assemblywomen Drulis, McCann Stamato, Assemblyman Atkins, Assemblywomen Ramirez, Peterpaul, Donlon, Reynolds-Jackson, Assemblymen Sampson, Freiman, Allen, DeAngelo, Danielsen, Verrelli, Assemblywoman McCoy, Assemblyman Singh, Assemblywomen Bagolie, Haider, Assemblyman Moen, Assemblywomen Collazos-Gill, Swain, Tucker, Assemblymen Rodriguez, Spearman, Assemblywomen Sumter, Kane, Pintor Marin and Morales SYNOPSIS Secures protections for patients and providers accessing and providing legally protected health care activities; establishes right of residents to legally protected health care services, which are restricted in other states. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning reproductive rights, and amending, supplementing, and repealing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     All citizens of this State, and those who travel to this State for health care services, deserve the ability to safely access health care facilities in this State and the critical reproductive health and gender-affirming care services that they provide. b.    Since the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, 21 states and counting have banned or severely restricted access to abortion.  In response to that decision, picketing at reproductive health care facilities increased by 21 percent and obstructions to these facilities increased by 538 percent nationwide. In New Jersey, there has been an approximately 30 percent increase in out-of-state patients, many of whom came to New Jersey because reproductive health care services are illegal in their home state. c.     In 2023, there were 23 reported violent incidents and threats made to health care facilities providing gender-affirming health care.  Fourteen states, including New Jersey, offer protections to people who provide, seek, or assist those seeking gender-affirming health care.  People seeking and providing this care deserve to be safe and protected. d.    In 2024, the Alabama Supreme Court in LePage v. Mobile Infirmary Clinic, P.C. (Docket No. SC-2022-0515, SC-2022-0579) ruled that embryos are extrauterine children, finding that that the states Wrongful Death of A Minor Act applies on its face to all unborn children, without limitation.  The holding, and the legal analysis on which the decision was based, could impact any person in a state which recognizes the individual rights of fetuses created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) and any person who is seeking or providing IVF. e.     New Jersey has long been a state that supports, and provides protections for the reproductive freedoms and health care choices of its citizens, including the right to make the choice of whether to start or expand a family through in vitro fertilization (IVF). f.     New Jersey, through this act, will codify critical protections to those seeking and providing reproductive and gender-affirming health care.  Further, this act is intended to ensure that anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ persons cannot harm patients or providers. 2.  (New section)   As used in P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Driveway means an entry from a public street to a public or private parking area used by a reproductive or gender-affirming health care services facility; Entrance means a door to a reproductive or gender-affirming health care services facility that directly abuts the public sidewalk; provided, however, that if the door does not directly abut the public sidewalk, the entrance shall be the point at which the public sidewalk intersects with a pathway leading to the door; Gathering means two or more individuals; and Gender-affirming health care services means all supplies, care, and services of a medical, behavioral health, mental health, surgical, psychiatric, therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative, rehabilitative, or supportive nature, including medication, relating to the treatment of gender dysphoria and gender incongruence. Gender-affirming health care services does not include sexual orientation change efforts as defined by section 2 of P.L.2013, c.150 (C.45:1-55). Impede means to obstruct, block, detain or render passage impossible, unsafe or unreasonably difficult. Intimidate means to place a person in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm to themselves or to another. Legally protected health care activity means providing, seeking, receiving, assisting with, or inquiring about reproductive health care services or gender-affirming health care services that are lawful in this State, regardless of the patients location. Physical obstruction means rendering ingress to or egress from a reproductive or gender-affirming health care services facility impassable to another person, or rendering passage to or from a reproductive health care services facility unreasonably difficult or hazardous to another person; Reproductive health care services includes all medical, surgical, counseling, or referral services relating to the human reproductive system, including, but not limited to, services relating to pregnancy, contraception, managing infertility, or the termination of a pregnancy; Reproductive or gender-affirming health care services facility includes a hospital, clinic, office, or other site that provides, refers, or seeks to provide reproductive or gender-affirming health care services and includes the building or structure in which the facility is located and the driveway of such building or structure; and Social media means an electronic service or account, or electronic content, including, but not limited to, videos or still photographs, blogs, video blogs, podcasts, instant and text messages, email, online services or accounts, or internet website profiles or locations. 3.    Section 9 of P.L.1978, c.73 (C.45:1-22) is amended to read as follows: 9.    In addition or as an alternative, as the case may be, to revoking, suspending or refusing to renew any license, registration or certificate issued by it, a board may, after affording an opportunity to be heard: a.     Issue a letter of warning, reprimand, or censure with regard to any act, conduct or practice which in the judgment of the board upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances does not warrant the initiation of formal action; b.    Assess civil penalties in accordance with this act; c.     Order that any person violating any provision of an act or regulation administered by such board to cease and desist from future violations thereof or to take such affirmative corrective action as may be necessary with regard to any act or practice found unlawful by the board; d.    Order any person found to have violated any provision of an act or regulation administered by such board to restore to any person aggrieved by an unlawful act or practice, any moneys or property, real or personal, acquired by means of such act or practice; provided, however, no board shall order restoration in a dollar amount greater than those moneys received by a licensee or his agent or any other person violating the act or regulation administered by the board; e.     Order any person, as a condition for continued, reinstated or renewed licensure, to secure medical or such other professional treatment as may be necessary to properly discharge licensee functions;

h.    Order any person, as a condition for continued, reinstated or renewed licensure, to submit to an assessment of skills to determine whether the licensee can continue to practice with reasonable skill and safety, and to submit to any supervision, monitoring or limitation on practice determined by the board to be necessary. A board may, upon a duly verified application of the Attorney General that either provides proof of a conviction of a court of competent jurisdiction for a crime or offense involving moral turpitude or relating adversely to the regulated profession or occupation, or alleges an act or practice violating any provision of an act or regulation administered by such board, enter a temporary order suspending or limiting any license issued by the board pending plenary hearing on an administrative complaint; provided, however, no such temporary order shall be entered unless the application made to the board palpably demonstrates a clear and imminent danger to the public health, safety and welfare and notice of such application is given to the licensee affected by such order.  If, upon review of the Attorney General's application, the board determines that, although no palpable demonstration of a clear and imminent danger has been made, the licensee's continued unrestricted practice pending plenary hearing may pose a risk to the public health, safety and welfare, the board may order the licensee to submit to medical or diagnostic testing and monitoring, or psychological evaluation, or an assessment of skills to determine whether the licensee can continue to practice with reasonable skill and safety. In any administrative proceeding commenced on a complaint alleging a violation of an act or regulation administered by a board, such board may issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of books, records, or documents at the hearing on the complaint. A board shall not impose any additional or alternative penalties pursuant to this section on the holder of a certificate, registration, or license based solely on the holder providing, authorizing, participating, referring to, or assisting with any health care, medical service, or procedure related to an abortion or gender-affirming health care services for a person who resides in a jurisdiction where the provision, authorization, participation, referral, or assistance is illegal, if it would not be a basis for additional or alternative penalties in this State.

Dispersal of Gatherings The bill authorized any law enforcement officer to order the immediate dispersal of a gathering that substantially impedes access to or departure from an entrance or driveway to a reproductive or gender-affirming health care facility during the business hours of the facility. Failure to comply with an order to disperse issued by the Attorney General or a law enforcement officer is a disorderly persons offense.  A disorderly persons offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. Licensing Boards The bill prohibits a board from imposing any additional or alternative penalties, in accordance with N.J.S.A.34:1-22, on the holder of a certificate, registration, or license based solely on the holder providing, authorizing, participating, referring to, or assisting with any health care, medical service, or procedure related to an abortion for a person who resides in a jurisdiction where the provision, authorization, participation, referral, or assistance is illegal. Applicability of Laws of Other States The bill establishes that a law of another state that authorized a person or government entity to bring a prosecution, civil action, or any other legal action to deter, prevent, sanction, or punish any person engaging, aiding, or assisting in providing or prescribing any legally protected health care activity is against the public policy of this State.  Further, such laws of another state are prohibited from being applied to any matter, case, or controversy heard in a State court or in an administrative tribunal of this State. The prohibition does not apply to an action founded in tort, contract, or statute under the laws of this State, or an action founded in tort, contract, or statute under the similar laws of another state.  This includes, but is not limited to, an alleged act of malpractice or negligence by a person in the persons profession or occupation. Protection of Patient Information This bill updates P.L.2022, c.51 to provide a definition of legally protected health care activity and gender-affirming health care services.  P.L.2022, c.51 provides certain protections with respect to the disclosure of patient information relating to reproductive health care services, as well as protecting access to health care, medical services, and procedures related to an abortion for persons who come to this State from jurisdictions in which these actions are illegal. The bill provides that in any civil action or other proceeding preliminary thereto, a medical provider or other covered entity, as described under federal law concerning medical privacy and security, is barred from disclosing the following communications or information, unless the patient or patients conservator, guardian, or other authorized legal representative explicitly consented in writing to the disclosure: (1) any communication made to the covered entity, or any information obtained by the covered entity from, a patient or the conservator, guardian, or other authorized legal representative of a patient relating to legally protected health care activity; or (2) any information obtained by personal examination of a patient relating to legally protected health care activity that is permitted under the laws of this State. Additionally, under the bill, a public entity of this State or employee, appointee, officer or official or any other person acting on behalf of a public entity would be prohibited from providing any information, or expending or using time, money, facilities, property, equipment, personnel or other resources in furtherance of any interstate investigation or proceeding seeking to impose civil or criminal liability upon a person or entity for: (1) the provision, receipt, or seeking of, or inquiring or responding to an inquiry about legally protected health care activity that is legal in this State; or (2) assisting, advising, aiding, abetting, facilitating, soliciting, or conspiring with any person or entity providing, receiving, seeking, or inquiring or responding to an inquiry about legally protected health care activity that is legal in this State. Extradition This bill updates N.J.S.A.2A:160-14.1 to prevent a person from being extradited to another state under certain circumstances related to legally protected health care activity.  Under current law, N.J.S.A.2A:160-14.1 prevents extradition as it relates to reproductive health care services.  Under the bill, Legally protected health care activity is defined as activity providing, seeking, receiving, assisting with, or inquiring about reproductive health care services or gender-affirming health care services that are lawful in this State, regardless of the patients location. Relatedly, the bill also defines gender-affirming health care services to mean all supplies, care, and services of a medical, behavioral health, mental health, surgical, psychiatric, therapeutic, diagnostic, preventative, rehabilitative, or supportive nature, including medication, relating to the treatment of gender dysphoria and gender incongruence.  Gender-affirming health care services does not include sexual orientation change efforts as defined by N.J.S.A.45:1-55. In Vitro Fertilization Protections This bill strengthens reproductive health care freedom in New Jersey by specifying that: every individual present in this State, including, but not limited to, an individual who is under State control or supervision, shall have the fundamental right to choose whether to use assisted reproductive technology (ART), including, but not limited to in vitro fertilization (IVF); and a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus shall not have independent rights under any of the laws of the State. Medicolegal Investigations This bill removes the requirement that a medical examiner conduct a medicolegal investigation of a death in the State related to a fetal death occurring without medical attendance.  This provisions seeks to ensure that a woman who has a miscarriage or fetal complications is not investigated or the fetal death criminalized. Repealers The bill repeals the following statutes, which have either been obviated by court decision or would be obviated by this bill: (1) N.J.S.A.2A:65A-5 through N.J.S.A.2A:65A-7 (banned partial birth abortions); (2) N.J.S.A.9:17A-1.1 through N.J.S.A.9:17A-1.12 (required parental notification for minors abortion); (3)   N.J.S.A.30:4D-6.1 (barred Medicaid payment for abortion except where necessary to save the womans life).
