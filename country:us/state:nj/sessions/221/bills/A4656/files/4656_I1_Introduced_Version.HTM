<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning reproductive rights, and amending,
supplementing, and repealing various parts of the statutory law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     All citizens of this
State, and those who travel to this State for health care services, deserve the
ability to safely access health care facilities in this State and the critical
reproductive health and gender-affirming care services that they provide.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Since the United States
Supreme Court overturned <u>Roe v. Wade</u> in 2022, 21 states and counting
have banned or severely restricted access to abortion.  In response to that
decision, picketing at reproductive health care facilities increased by 21
percent and obstructions to these facilities increased by 538 percent
nationwide. In New Jersey, there has been an approximately 30 percent increase
in out-of-state patients, many of whom came to New Jersey because reproductive
health care services are illegal in their home state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In 2023, there were 23
reported violent incidents and threats made to health care facilities providing
gender-affirming health care.  Fourteen states, including New Jersey, offer
protections to people who provide, seek, or assist those seeking
gender-affirming health care.  People seeking and providing this care deserve
to be safe and protected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    In 2024, the Alabama
Supreme Court in <u>LePage</u> v. <u>Mobile Infirmary Clinic, P.C.</u><b><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"lato",serif;color:#546E7A;
background:white'> </span></b>(Docket No. SC-2022-0515, SC-2022-0579) ruled that
embryos are extrauterine children, finding that that the states Wrongful
Death of A Minor Act applies on its face to all unborn children, without
limitation.  The holding, and the legal analysis on which the decision was
based, could impact any person in a state which recognizes the individual
rights of fetuses created through in vitro fertilization (IVF) and any person
who is seeking or providing IVF.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     New Jersey has long
been a state that supports, and provides protections for the reproductive
freedoms and health care choices of its citizens, including the right to make
the choice of whether to start or expand a family through in vitro
fertilization (IVF).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     New Jersey, through
this act, will codify critical protections to those seeking and providing
reproductive and gender-affirming health care.  Further, this act is intended
to ensure that anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ persons cannot harm patients or
providers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  (New section)   As used in
P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Driveway means an entry from
a public street to a public or private parking area used by a reproductive or
gender-affirming health care services facility; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Entrance means a door to a
reproductive or gender-affirming health care services facility that directly
abuts the public sidewalk; provided, however, that if the door does not
directly abut the public sidewalk, the entrance shall be the point at which
the public sidewalk intersects with a pathway leading to the door;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Gathering means two or more
individuals; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Gender-affirming health care
services means all supplies, care, and services of a medical, behavioral
health, mental health, surgical, psychiatric, therapeutic, diagnostic,
preventative, rehabilitative, or supportive nature, including medication,
relating to the treatment of gender dysphoria and gender incongruence. 
Gender-affirming health care services does not include sexual orientation
change efforts as defined by section 2 of P.L.2013, c.150 (C.45:1-55).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Impede means to obstruct,
block, detain or render passage impossible, unsafe or unreasonably difficult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Intimidate means to place a
person in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm to themselves or to another. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Legally protected health care
activity means providing, seeking, receiving, assisting with, or inquiring
about reproductive health care services or gender-affirming health care
services that are lawful in this State, regardless of the patients location.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Physical obstruction means
rendering ingress to or egress from a reproductive or gender-affirming health
care services facility impassable to another person, or rendering passage to or
