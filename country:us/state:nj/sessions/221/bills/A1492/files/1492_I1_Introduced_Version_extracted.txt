Under the bill, this study, at a minimum, would: (1) examine each public highway to determine if, and for what time period, each public highway is equipped to handle the additional weight of electric vehicles; (2) provide recommendations to improve the ability of each public highway to accommodate the additional weight of electric vehicles; and (3) develop a list of public highways that ranks each public highway from least-to-most able to accommodate the additional weight of electric vehicles. The bill also requires the department to prepare and submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature containing the studys findings and recommendations, and the list developed by the department under the study. When considering public highway projects for inclusion in the Annual Transportation Capital Program, the bill also requires the department to prioritize those projects that would address public highways that are unable to accommodate the additional weight of electric vehicles.  The bill provides that as a condition of receiving funding for a public highway project under the Annual Transportation Capital Program, the project sponsor would be required to certify that the project enables the public highway to accommodate the additional weight of electric vehicles.
