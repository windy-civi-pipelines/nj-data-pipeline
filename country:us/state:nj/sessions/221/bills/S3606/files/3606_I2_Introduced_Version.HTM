<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of the
State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 6 of P.L.1965,
c.89 (C.53:5A-6) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6. a. Service as a full-time
commissioned officer, noncommissioned officer or trooper rendered as a member,
and service credit which was transferred from the former &quot;State Police
Retirement and Benevolent Fund,&quot; or transferred from any other
State-administered retirement system, shall, if the required contributions are
made by the State and the member, be considered as creditable service.  If such
transferred service credit is established, it shall be considered the same as
creditable service as a full-time commissioned officer, noncommissioned officer
or trooper rendered as a member.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, service as a
chief inspector, deputy chief inspector, inspector and special inspector in the
Motor Vehicle Commission or equivalent Civil Service classifications, including
Chief, Highway Patrol Bureau; Assistant Chief (Major), Highway Patrol Bureau;
Captain, Highway Patrol Bureau; Lieutenant, Highway Patrol Bureau; Sergeant,
Highway Patrol Bureau; and Officer, Highway Patrol Bureau, and service credit
may be transferred from the Police and Firemen's Retirement System, the Public
Employees' Retirement System, or any other State-administered retirement system
and shall, if the required contributions are made by the State and the member,
be considered as creditable service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, service as a
member of the State Capitol Police Force, or as a Supervising Inspector,
Principal Inspector, Senior Inspector, or Inspector Recruit in the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Enforcement Bureau or as a Principal Marine Law Enforcement
Officer, Senior Marine Law Enforcement Officer, or Marine Law Enforcement
Officer in the Bureau of Marine Law Enforcement and service credit transferred
from the Police and Firemen's Retirement System, the Public Employees'
Retirement System, or any other State-administered retirement system shall, if
the required contributions are made by the State and the member, be considered
as creditable service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A member on suspension shall
be considered in service for the period of the suspension, but the period of
suspension shall not be considered as creditable service unless the member
receives salary therefor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Any member of the
retirement system, who, prior to becoming a member, had established service
credits in this or another retirement system supported in whole or in part by
the State, or who had rendered service to the State prior to becoming a member,
or had purchased service credits while in another State-administered retirement
system or in the Police and Firemen's Retirement System or the Public
Employees' Retirement System, while serving as chief inspector, deputy chief
inspector, inspector or special inspector in the Enforcement Bureau, Motor Vehicle
Commission, or as a member of the State Capitol Police Force, or as a
Supervising Inspector, Principal Inspector, Senior Inspector, Inspector, or
Inspector Recruit in the Alcoholic Beverage Control Enforcement Bureau, or as a
Principal Marine Law Enforcement Officer, Senior Marine Law Enforcement
Officer, or Marine Law Enforcement Officer in the Bureau of Marine Law
Enforcement, for which the member desires to establish credit in this
retirement system, shall be permitted to purchase such credit, or to transfer
such previously purchased credit, by paying into the annuity savings fund the
amount required by applying the factor, supplied by the actuary, as being
applicable to the member's age at the time of the transfer or purchase, to the
member's salary at that time. Such payment may be made in regular installments
equal to at least half of the normal contribution to the retirement system,
over a maximum period of 10 years.  If such purchased service credit or
transferred purchased credit is established, it shall be considered the same as
creditable service as a full-time commissioned officer, noncommissioned
officer, or trooper rendered as a member.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A member who retires prior to
completing the payments as agreed with the retirement system will receive pro
rata credit for service purchased prior to the date of retirement, but if the
member so elects at the time of retirement, the member may make the additional
lump sum payment required at that time to provide full credit; except that in
the case of retirement pursuant to any section of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-1 et
seq.) other than sections 8, 27, and 28 thereof, if an employee's membership
has been terminated and the member is re-enrolled as a member of the retirement
system, the member shall be accorded, upon the completion of one year of
membership after the member's election to make the purchase and the payment of
at least half the total amount due, the pension credit as it was at the time of
the member's termination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Not more than one year
shall be credited for all service in a calendar year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    In computing service,
time during which a member was absent on an official leave without pay shall be
credited if such leave was for a period of:  (1) less than three months; or (2)
up to a maximum of two years, if the leave was due to the member's personal
illness and the period of leave is allowed for retirement purposes within one
year following his return to service after the termination of such leave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The method of
computation and the terms of the purchase of service permitted by subsections
b. and d. of this section shall be identical to those stipulated for the
purchase of previous membership service by members of the system, as provided
by subsection a. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     For any person who becomes
a member of the retirement system pursuant to P.L.1997, c.19 (C.53:1-8.2 et
al.) and is required to retire pursuant to section 8 of P.L.1965, c.89
(C.53:5A-8) with less than 20 years of creditable service in the retirement
system, and who retires prior to the effective date of P.L.2019, c.251, an
amount of service credit transferred or purchased pursuant to subsection b.

detailed statement of military service in the Armed Forces of the United
States, <u>including any period of enrollment in a military service academy,</u>
rendered prior to becoming a member, for which the member desires credit, and
of such other facts as the retirement system may require. The member may
purchase credit for all or a portion of the service evidenced in the statement
up to the nearest number of years and months, but not exceeding 10 years,
provided however, that a member purchasing that maximum credit may purchase up
to five additional years for additional military service qualifying the member
as a veteran as defined in section 3 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-3).  If such
credit is established, it shall be considered the same as creditable service as
a full-time commissioned officer, noncommissioned officer or trooper rendered
as a member.  No application shall be accepted for the purchase of credit for
the service if, at the time of application, the member has a vested right to
retirement benefits in another retirement system based in whole or in part upon
that service.  The member may purchase credit for the service by paying into
the annuity savings fund the amount required by applying the factor, supplied
by the actuary as being applicable to the member's age at the time of the
purchase, to the member's salary at that time, or to the highest annual
compensation for service in this State for which contributions were made during
any prior fiscal year of membership, whichever is greater.  The purchase may be
made in regular installments, equal to at least 1/2 of the full normal
contribution to the retirement system, over a maximum period of 10 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The employer of a member who
applies, pursuant to this section, to purchase credit for military service in
the Armed Forces of the United States<u>, including any period of enrollment in

retirement system on behalf of the member for the purchase of this credit.  The
Adjutant General of the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs shall be
responsible for determining whether any person seeking to be considered a
&quot;veteran&quot; under section 3 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-3), for the purpose
of purchasing military service credit, meets the criteria set forth therein and
adjudicating an appeal from any person disputing this determination.  The
determination of the Adjutant General shall be binding upon the Division of
Pensions and Benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any provision
of this act to the contrary, a member shall not be liable for any costs

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill allows a member of
the New Jersey State Police Retirement System (SPRS) to purchase credit in the
retirement system for military service in the Armed Forces of the United
States, the period of enrollment in the New Jersey State Police Academy, and
employment as a class two special law enforcement officer prior to becoming a
member.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a period of
service in the United States Armed Forces qualifies as military service that a
member of the SPRS may purchase for retirement purposes.  This bill permits the
purchase of the period of enrollment in a United States military service
academy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The military service academies
are the United States Military Academy, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, and
the Coast Guard Academy.  These four service academies educate young people to
serve as commissioned officers in the various branches of the United States
Armed Forces.  They are the only academies whose students are on active duty in
the United State Armed Forces from the day they enter the academy, with the
rank of cadet and midshipman, and subject to the Uniform Code of Military
Justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also allows a member
of the SPRS to purchase credit in the retirement system for graduation from the
New Jersey State Police Academy or for employment as a class two special law
enforcement officer, or both, prior to becoming a member.  The bill provides
that a member may purchase credit for all or a portion of such service rendered
while enrolled in the New Jersey State Police Academy or employed by a public employer
as a class two special law enforcement officer, or both.  Under the bill, the
SPRS credit purchased for enrollment in the New Jersey State Police Academy or
employment as a class two special law enforcement officer, or both, is
equivalent to service in the State Police as a member of the SPRS in qualifying
for retirement benefits.</p>
