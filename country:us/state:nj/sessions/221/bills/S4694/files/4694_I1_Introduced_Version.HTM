Upon the conclusion of each examination of a regulated financial institution pursuant to section 3 of this act, the department shall prepare a written evaluation of the institution's record of meeting the needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income consumers and neighborhoods, other distressed or underserved communities and other underserved populations. b.    As appropriate, the department may conduct exams jointly with federal supervisory agencies in the case of depository institutions or other regulated financial institutions that are or could be subject to a federal requirement pursuant to the federal Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, Pub.L.95-128 (12 U.S.C. s.2901 et seq.). c.     The department shall: (1)   examine every regulated financial institution for compliance with section 3 of this act no less than once every three years; and (2)   make public an examination schedule at the beginning of each year and update the schedule each quarter, and invite public comment related to a regulated financial institutions compliance with this act. d.    Each written evaluation required under subsection a. of this section shall have a public section and a confidential section. e.     The public section of the written evaluation shall: (1)   state the departments conclusions for each exam criterion and any subtest identified in the regulations, as prescribed by the department to effectuate the purposes of this act; (2)   discuss the facts and data supporting the conclusions; and (3)   contain the regulated financial institution's rating and a statement describing the basis for the rating.

The department shall require an improvement plan for a regulated financial institution that receives a rating of low satisfactory or lower on the written evaluation of the institution or in any individual assessment area of the institution.  The plan shall result in the reasonable likelihood that the institution will obtain a rating of at least satisfactory in meeting community credit or other financial needs in the relevant assessment areas on the next examination. b.    A regulated financial institution that is required to submit an improvement plan required under subsection a. of this section shall submit the plan in writing to the department not later than 90 days after receiving notice that the regulated financial institution is required to submit the plan. c.     Upon receipt of an improvement plan of a regulated financial institution required pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the department shall: (1)   make the plan available to the public for review and comment for a period of not less than 60 days; and (2)   require the regulated financial institution to revise, as appropriate, the improvement plan in response to the public comments received and submit the updated plan to the department not later than 60 days after the end of that period. 7.    a. In the case of any depository institution which donates, sells on favorable terms, as determined by the department, or makes available on a rent-free basis any branch of the institution which is located in any predominantly minority neighborhood to any minority depository institution or women's depository institution, the amount of the contribution or the amount of the loss incurred in connection with the activity may be a factor in determining whether the depository institution is meeting the credit needs of the institution's community for purposes of this act. b.    For purposes of this section: Minority institution means a depository institution where: (1)   more than 50 percent of the ownership or control is held by one or more minority individuals; (2)   more than 50 percent of the net profit or loss of which accrues to one or more minority individuals; and (3)   a significant percentage of senior management positions are held by minority individuals. Women's depository institution means a depository institution where: (1)   more than 50 percent of the ownership or control is held by one or more women; (2)   more than 50 percent of the net profit or loss of which accrues to one or more women; and (3) a significant percentage of senior management positions are held by women. 8.    a. Each regulated financial institution shall collect and maintain in machine readable form, as prescribed by the department, data on the categories of community development lending and investments, including data regarding financing affordable housing, small business development, community facilities, and economic development. b.    The department shall publicly disseminate the data described in subsection a. of this section for: (1)   each regulated financial institution on a county level and for categories of census tracts including low- and moderate-income census tracts or other distressed and underserved census tracts; and (2)   the aggregate regulated financial institutions covered by this act by individual census tracts in addition to the categories described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. 9.    a. The department shall have the authority to adjust fees paid by regulated financial institutions in part based on the rating received by the institutions under this act. b.    Any regulated financial institution receiving a rating of needs to improve or substantial noncompliance shall not be eligible to receive deposits from a State agency. 10.  A regulated financial institution shall provide, in the public lobby of each of its offices, if any, and on its website, a public notice that is substantially similar to the following: State Community Reinvestment Notice The Department of Banking and Insurance evaluates our performance in meeting the financial services needs of this community, including the needs of low-income to moderate-income households and other underserved populations and communities.  The department takes this evaluation into account when deciding on certain applications submitted by us for approval by the department.  Your involvement is encouraged.  You may obtain a copy of our evaluation.  You may also submit signed, written comments about our performance in meeting community financial services needs to the department. 11.  The Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of this act. 12.  P.L.1991, c.294 (C.17:16Q-1 et seq.) is repealed. 13.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes a community reinvestment law for the State of New Jersey.  It requires similar analysis and evaluation of banks, mortgage companies, and credit unions to determine and rate if these institutions are lending, investing, and providing financial services to low- and moderate-income consumers and communities.  This includes underserved communities and populations. Under the bill, the Department of Banking and Insurance (the department) is to review activities of the various regulated financial institutions in the State every three years. This includes reviewing various types of products and services offered by an institution including, but not limited, to: 1) retail lending, such as home and small business loans; 2) community development lending; 3) low-cost deposit accounts and other retail financial services; and 4) how an institution works with delinquent consumers.  Upon the departments examination, a rating is assigned to an institution.  If a rating of low satisfactory or lower is given to a regulated financial institution, an improvement plan is to be developed between the institution, the department, and comments from members of the public. Additionally, under the bill, the department is to develop a disparity study.  This is to identify underserved counties, populations, and census tracts in the State.  Data collected for this study may be shared with federal agencies.  Upon completion, a report of the findings and recommendations is to be issued to the Legislature. Lastly, each regulated financial institution is to post a notice in each branch, or on its website, a notice for public consumption stating, in part, that the institutions performance is evaluated based on how it meets the needs of its community and that a copy of the evaluation is available for review.

The information required by subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection shall be presented separately for assessment areas including the State, metropolitan areas, urban or rural counties or groupings of rural counties. f.     The rating of a regulated financial institution referred to in paragraph (3) of subsection e. of this section shall be one of the following: (A)  Outstanding record of meeting community needs; (B)  Satisfactory record of meeting community needs; (C)  Low satisfactory record of meeting community needs; (D)  Needs to improve record of meeting community needs; or (E)  Substantial noncompliance in meeting community needs. As it deems appropriate, the department may amend these rating categories by adding new ones or altering the existing categories, and may also add a point scale. g.    The confidential section of the written evaluation shall contain all references that identify any consumer of the regulated financial institution, any employee or officer of the institution, or any individual or organization that has provided information in confidence to the department or a federal financial supervisory agency. h.    The confidential section shall also contain any statements obtained or made by the department in the course of an examination which, in the judgment of the department, are too sensitive or speculative in nature to disclose to the regulated financial institution or the public. i.     The confidential section may be disclosed, in whole or part, to the regulated financial institution, if the department determines that the disclosure will promote the objectives of this act.  However, disclosure shall not identify an individual or organization that has provided information in confidence to the department or a federal financial supervisory agency. 5.    a.  The department shall contract with qualified individuals for a disparity study that shall identify underserved counties, populations, and census tracts in the State. b.    The study shall: (1)   identify segments of the population that are underserved because they are experiencing disparities in lending or discrimination by metropolitan areas and by urban and rural counties; (2)   be updated once every three years and made publicly available; (3)   inform the examinations described in section 4 of this act; and (4)   identify disparities in access to retail loans, community development financing, and branches and other bank services experienced by various groups of consumers and geographical areas. c.     In carrying out each study required under subsections a. and b. of this section, the department may make available to federal financial supervisory agencies data collected, including the following: (1)   data obtained under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, Pub.L.94-200 (12 U.S.C. s.2801 et seq.); (2)   data obtained under section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as added by section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub.L.111-203 (12 U.S.C. s.1691c-2); (3)   data obtained under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, Pub.L.95-128 (12 U.S.C. s.2901 et seq.); (4)   other available State data; and (5)   information contained in public litigation against regulated financial institutions for redlining or lending discrimination, including litigation initiated by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Affairs, the U.S. Department of Justice, or by private parties. d.    The department shall make the results of its disparity study publicly available on its website and shall issue a report of its findings to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), that shall include recommendations addressing the identification of policies, practices, and procedures that contribute to disparities and discrimination in access to credit and banking services. 6.    a. The department shall require an improvement plan for a regulated financial institution that receives a rating of low satisfactory or lower on the written evaluation of the institution or in any individual assessment area of the institution.  The plan shall result in the reasonable likelihood that the institution will obtain a rating of at least satisfactory in meeting community credit or other financial needs in the relevant assessment areas on the next examination. b.    A regulated financial institution that is required to submit an improvement plan required under subsection a. of this section shall submit the plan in writing to the department not later than 90 days after receiving notice that the regulated financial institution is required to submit the plan. c.     Upon receipt of an improvement plan of a regulated financial institution required pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the department shall: (1)   make the plan available to the public for review and comment for a period of not less than 60 days; and (2)   require the regulated financial institution to revise, as appropriate, the improvement plan in response to the public comments received and submit the updated plan to the department not later than 60 days after the end of that period. 7.    a. In the case of any depository institution which donates, sells on favorable terms, as determined by the department, or makes available on a rent-free basis any branch of the institution which is located in any predominantly minority neighborhood to any minority depository institution or women's depository institution, the amount of the contribution or the amount of the loss incurred in connection with the activity may be a factor in determining whether the depository institution is meeting the credit needs of the institution's community for purposes of this act. b.    For purposes of this section: Minority institution means a depository institution where: (1)   more than 50 percent of the ownership or control is held by one or more minority individuals; (2)   more than 50 percent of the net profit or loss of which accrues to one or more minority individuals; and (3)   a significant percentage of senior management positions are held by minority individuals. Women's depository institution means a depository institution where: (1)   more than 50 percent of the ownership or control is held by one or more women; (2)   more than 50 percent of the net profit or loss of which accrues to one or more women; and (3) a significant percentage of senior management positions are held by women. 8.    a. Each regulated financial institution shall collect and maintain in machine readable form, as prescribed by the department, data on the categories of community development lending and investments, including data regarding financing affordable housing, small business development, community facilities, and economic development. b.    The department shall publicly disseminate the data described in subsection a. of this section for: (1)   each regulated financial institution on a county level and for categories of census tracts including low- and moderate-income census tracts or other distressed and underserved census tracts; and (2)   the aggregate regulated financial institutions covered by this act by individual census tracts in addition to the categories described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. 9.    a. The department shall have the authority to adjust fees paid by regulated financial institutions in part based on the rating received by the institutions under this act. b.    Any regulated financial institution receiving a rating of needs to improve or substantial noncompliance shall not be eligible to receive deposits from a State agency. 10.  A regulated financial institution shall provide, in the public lobby of each of its offices, if any, and on its website, a public notice that is substantially similar to the following: State Community Reinvestment Notice The Department of Banking and Insurance evaluates our performance in meeting the financial services needs of this community, including the needs of low-income to moderate-income households and other underserved populations and communities.  The department takes this evaluation into account when deciding on certain applications submitted by us for approval by the department.  Your involvement is encouraged.  You may obtain a copy of our evaluation.  You may also submit signed, written comments about our performance in meeting community financial services needs to the department. 11.  The Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of this act. 12.  P.L.1991, c.294 (C.17:16Q-1 et seq.) is repealed. 13.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes a community reinvestment law for the State of New Jersey.  It requires similar analysis and evaluation of banks, mortgage companies, and credit unions to determine and rate if these institutions are lending, investing, and providing financial services to low- and moderate-income consumers and communities.  This includes underserved communities and populations. Under the bill, the Department of Banking and Insurance (the department) is to review activities of the various regulated financial institutions in the State every three years. This includes reviewing various types of products and services offered by an institution including, but not limited, to: 1) retail lending, such as home and small business loans; 2) community development lending; 3) low-cost deposit accounts and other retail financial services; and 4) how an institution works with delinquent consumers.  Upon the departments examination, a rating is assigned to an institution.  If a rating of low satisfactory or lower is given to a regulated financial institution, an improvement plan is to be developed between the institution, the department, and comments from members of the public. Additionally, under the bill, the department is to develop a disparity study.  This is to identify underserved counties, populations, and census tracts in the State.  Data collected for this study may be shared with federal agencies.  Upon completion, a report of the findings and recommendations is to be issued to the Legislature. Lastly, each regulated financial institution is to post a notice in each branch, or on its website, a notice for public consumption stating, in part, that the institutions performance is evaluated based on how it meets the needs of its community and that a copy of the evaluation is available for review.
