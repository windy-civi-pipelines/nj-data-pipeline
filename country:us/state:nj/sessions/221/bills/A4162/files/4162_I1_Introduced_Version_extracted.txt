(C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) that qualify as development or a stewardship activity, as those terms are defined in section 3 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-45), for recreation and conservation purposes in accordance with the provisions of the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.). b.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of section 6 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-48) or any other law to the contrary, the expenditure of funds pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not require the approval of the Joint Budget Oversight Committee, or its successor. c.  There is appropriated from the General Fund to the Preserve New Jersey Green Acres Fund, established pursuant to section 6 of the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-48), the sum of $50,000,000 to implement the provisions of subsection a. of this section. 13.  There is appropriated to the Department of Environmental Protection the sum of $10,000,000 from the Garden State Green Acres Preservation Trust Fund and any Green Acres fund established pursuant to P.L.1961, c.46, P.L.1971, c.165, P.L.1974, c.102, P.L.1978, c.118, P.L.1983, c.354, P.L.1987, c.265, P.L.1989, c.183, P.L.1992, c.88; P.L.1995, c.204, P.L.2007, c.119, or P.L.2009, c.117, made available due to loan repayments and interest earnings, in order to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), provided that the use of the funds is consistent with the provisions of the relevant bond act. 14.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would establish various programs and in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) concerning the management of publicly owned forested land in the State.  The bill would appropriate $50 million in constitutionally dedicated corporate business tax (CBT) revenues and $10 million from Green Acres bond act funds to implement the programs established by the bill. Specifically, the bill would require the DEP to conduct a comprehensive survey, mapping, and planning process for publicly owned forested lands, including lands owned by the State, and parcels of land owned by local government units that are larger than a size threshold that the DEP is to determine under the bill.  The bill would require the survey to include certain items, as enumerated in subsection b. of section 2 of the bill, including the identification of forests that are suitable to be designated as part of the New Jersey Natural Areas System and the identification of areas suitable to function as carbon reserves.  The bill would require the DEP to update the survey at least every 10 years. The bill would direct the DEP to establish a program to designate appropriate forested areas of the State as Carbon Reserve Forests.  The bill would require that the program have the goals of (1) sequestering sufficient carbon in the State to advance the State's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, (2) protecting mature forests, and (3) providing for the development of old growth forests in the future.  Under the bill, active management (e.g., tree felling) of a Carbon Reserve Forest would be required to have the aim of addressing an ecological or safety threat. Under the bill, the DEP would be required to adopt, within one year after the bill's enactment, rules and regulations to provide interim guidelines for forest stewardship and other management plans for publicly owned forested lands.  The DEP would be required to cease approving such plans until the rules and regulations are adopted.  In addition, the bill would require the DEP to adopt more comprehensive rules and regulations concerning forest stewardship plans on public forests, within three years after the bill's enactment.  The bill would establish certain requirements for the rules and regulations, as enumerated in subsections b. and c. of section 6 of the bill.  The bill would require any forest stewardship or other management plan for a State-owned parcel of forested land, or for a locally owned parcel of forested land that is larger than the size threshold established by the DEP, to conform to the rules and regulations.  The bill would require that this threshold be not less than 10 acres. The bill would direct the DEP to establish a program to measure the deer population on publicly owned forested lands.  The bill would also direct the DEP to begin developing programs to reduce the deer population, including:  (1) establishing a pilot program for commercial sale of venison; (2) studying the viability of reintroducing natural predators into the State; (3) implementing fertility control measures on deer populations, including sterilization; and (4) revising current rules, regulations, and guidelines regarding deer baiting and feeding practices. The bill would amend the "Natural Areas System Act," P.L.1975, c.33 (C.13:1B-15.12a) to authorize the DEP to add additional acres of appropriate forested lands to the State's Natural Areas System.  The bill would also require the DEP to develop and implement an appropriate management plan for each natural area in the Natural Areas System. The bill would amend the "Prescribed Burn Act," P.L.2018, c.107 (C.13:9-44.11 et seq.) to require the DEP to develop and administer a program for prescribed burning on public and private lands within 18 months after the bill's enactment.  The bill would also require that certain provisions be included in the program.  Current law authorizes the DEP to conduct prescribed burning or mechanical vegetation removal on an area of land which is determined by the Forest Fire Service to be in reasonable danger of wildfire.  This bill would require the DEP to conduct prescribed burning or mechanical vegetation removal on an area of land which is determined by the Forest Fire Service to be in danger of wildfire.  The bill would also require the DEP to adopt rules and regulations to implement the "Prescribed Burn Act" within 18 months after the bill's enactment. Finally, the bill would appropriate $50 million in constitutionally dedicated CBT revenues for those portions of the bill's provisions that qualify as development or a stewardship activity on lands permanently preserved for recreation and conservation purposes.  The bill would also appropriate $10 million from Green Acres bond act funds to implement the bill's provisions, provided that the use of the moneys is consistent with the provisions of the relevant bond act.

(2) As used in this subsection, forest plan and forest stewardship plan mean the same as defined in section 1 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.1975, c.363, s.4) 9.  Section 4 of P.L.2018, c.107 (C.13:9-44.14) is amended to read as follows: 4.  a.  The Department of Environmental Protection shall, no later than 18 months after the effective date of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), develop and administer a program for prescribed burning on public and private lands under which the department may authorize a person to conduct a prescribed burn pursuant to a prescribed burn plan approved by the department.  The program shall provide for the use of fire as a tool for the management of the State's forests, based upon sound science.  The program shall include, but not be limited to: (1)  the development of a set of best practices for the use of prescribed burning as an effective tool for forest management and public safety; (2)  the development of a prescribed burn plan for each appropriate parcel of forested land owned by the State, with priority given to those areas that are identified as being especially susceptible to wildfires pursuant to paragraph (9) of subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (3)  the provision of assistance, including appropriate training, to local governmental entities or private landowners in developing and implement a prescribed burn plan; and (4)  a process to identify and periodically report to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), the Legislature on any legal barriers that hinder the use of prescribed fire by trained land managers. b.    The department may charge a reasonable fee to cover the costs associated with the program.  All such fees collected shall be credited to a special dedicated account in the General Fund and appropriated to the Forest Fire Service to help pay for the administration and operation of its forest fire programs. c.     A person who desires to conduct a prescribed burn only on land for which the person is the landowner or lessee shall not be required to become certified. (cf: P.L.2018, c.107, s.4) 10.  Section 5 of P.L.2018, c.107 (C.13:9-44.15) is amended to read as follows: 5.  a.  The department [may] shall conduct a prescribed burn or mechanically manage vegetation in any area of land within the State which is determined by the Forest Fire Service to be in [reasonable] danger of wildfire due to the accumulation of wildland fire fuels. b.    For lands not owned or controlled by the State, which are determined by the Forest Fire Service to be in [reasonable] danger of wildfire due to the accumulation of wildland fire fuels, the Forest Fire Service shall: (1)   provide written notice to each affected local governmental entity within which the affected land is located that describes the purpose of the prescribed burn and describes the areas to be burned in the prescribed burn; (2)   publish a prescribed burn notice, which shall include an explanation of the purpose of the prescribed burn and a description of the area to be burned, in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the area of the prescribed burn; (3)   provide prior written notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal service, of the proposed prescribed burn to each affected landowner and lessee, if known, of the purpose of the prescribed burn and the description of any land that is included in the area to be burned in the prescribed burn, which notice shall be sent at least 30 days prior to the prescribed burn unless the department makes a written finding that an emergency exists, in which case the prior written notice shall be sent as soon as possible after the finding is made; and (4)   consider any landowner or lessee objections to the prescribed burning of the property pursuant to subsection c. of this section. c.     An objecting landowner or lessee may apply to the Forest Fire Service for a review of alternative methods of wildland fire fuel reduction on the property.  If the Forest Fire Service does not resolve the objection, the Assistant Commissioner or designee thereof shall convene a panel composed of the local Forest Fire Service manager, the fire chief of the jurisdiction, and a local official designated by the municipality in which the land is located, or any of their designees. The panel shall review the prescribed burning of the property, objections to the prescribed burn, and the proposed alternative fuel reduction methods, and shall recommend a course of action to reduce the wildland fire fuels that specifies the minimum amount of land required for treatment. If the panel's recommendation is not acceptable to the objecting landowner or lessee, the landowner or lessee may request further consideration by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection or the commissioner's designee, and shall thereafter be entitled to an administrative hearing as a contested case pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). d.    The department may assess against a landowner or lessee reasonable fees and costs for a prescribed burn conducted by the Forest Fire Service for any wildland fuel hazard that poses an extraordinary threat to life, property, or a natural resource as authorized pursuant to this section.

(C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), provided that the use of the funds is consistent with the provisions of the relevant bond act. 14.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would establish various programs and in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) concerning the management of publicly owned forested land in the State.  The bill would appropriate $50 million in constitutionally dedicated corporate business tax (CBT) revenues and $10 million from Green Acres bond act funds to implement the programs established by the bill. Specifically, the bill would require the DEP to conduct a comprehensive survey, mapping, and planning process for publicly owned forested lands, including lands owned by the State, and parcels of land owned by local government units that are larger than a size threshold that the DEP is to determine under the bill.  The bill would require the survey to include certain items, as enumerated in subsection b. of section 2 of the bill, including the identification of forests that are suitable to be designated as part of the New Jersey Natural Areas System and the identification of areas suitable to function as carbon reserves.  The bill would require the DEP to update the survey at least every 10 years. The bill would direct the DEP to establish a program to designate appropriate forested areas of the State as Carbon Reserve Forests.  The bill would require that the program have the goals of (1) sequestering sufficient carbon in the State to advance the State's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, (2) protecting mature forests, and (3) providing for the development of old growth forests in the future.  Under the bill, active management (e.g., tree felling) of a Carbon Reserve Forest would be required to have the aim of addressing an ecological or safety threat. Under the bill, the DEP would be required to adopt, within one year after the bill's enactment, rules and regulations to provide interim guidelines for forest stewardship and other management plans for publicly owned forested lands.  The DEP would be required to cease approving such plans until the rules and regulations are adopted.  In addition, the bill would require the DEP to adopt more comprehensive rules and regulations concerning forest stewardship plans on public forests, within three years after the bill's enactment.  The bill would establish certain requirements for the rules and regulations, as enumerated in subsections b. and c. of section 6 of the bill.  The bill would require any forest stewardship or other management plan for a State-owned parcel of forested land, or for a locally owned parcel of forested land that is larger than the size threshold established by the DEP, to conform to the rules and regulations.  The bill would require that this threshold be not less than 10 acres. The bill would direct the DEP to establish a program to measure the deer population on publicly owned forested lands.  The bill would also direct the DEP to begin developing programs to reduce the deer population, including:  (1) establishing a pilot program for commercial sale of venison; (2) studying the viability of reintroducing natural predators into the State; (3) implementing fertility control measures on deer populations, including sterilization; and (4) revising current rules, regulations, and guidelines regarding deer baiting and feeding practices. The bill would amend the "Natural Areas System Act," P.L.1975, c.33 (C.13:1B-15.12a) to authorize the DEP to add additional acres of appropriate forested lands to the State's Natural Areas System.  The bill would also require the DEP to develop and implement an appropriate management plan for each natural area in the Natural Areas System. The bill would amend the "Prescribed Burn Act," P.L.2018, c.107 (C.13:9-44.11 et seq.) to require the DEP to develop and administer a program for prescribed burning on public and private lands within 18 months after the bill's enactment.  The bill would also require that certain provisions be included in the program.  Current law authorizes the DEP to conduct prescribed burning or mechanical vegetation removal on an area of land which is determined by the Forest Fire Service to be in reasonable danger of wildfire.  This bill would require the DEP to conduct prescribed burning or mechanical vegetation removal on an area of land which is determined by the Forest Fire Service to be in danger of wildfire.  The bill would also require the DEP to adopt rules and regulations to implement the "Prescribed Burn Act" within 18 months after the bill's enactment. Finally, the bill would appropriate $50 million in constitutionally dedicated CBT revenues for those portions of the bill's provisions that qualify as development or a stewardship activity on lands permanently preserved for recreation and conservation purposes.  The bill would also appropriate $10 million from Green Acres bond act funds to implement the bill's provisions, provided that the use of the moneys is consistent with the provisions of the relevant bond act.
