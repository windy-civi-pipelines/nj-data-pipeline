implement the programs established by the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
require the DEP to conduct a comprehensive survey, mapping, and planning
process for publicly owned forested lands, including lands owned by the State,
and parcels of land owned by local government units that are larger than a size
threshold that the DEP is to determine under the bill.  The bill would require
the survey to include certain items, as enumerated in subsection b. of section
2 of the bill, including the identification of forests that are suitable to be
designated as part of the New Jersey Natural Areas System and the
identification of areas suitable to function as carbon reserves.  The bill
would require the DEP to update the survey at least every 10 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would direct the DEP
to establish a program to designate appropriate forested areas of the State as
Carbon Reserve Forests.  The bill would require that the program have the goals
of (1) sequestering sufficient carbon in the State to advance the State's
greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, (2) protecting mature forests, and
(3) providing for the development of old growth forests in the future.  Under
the bill, active management (e.g., tree felling) of a Carbon Reserve Forest
would be required to have the aim of addressing an ecological or safety threat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the DEP would
be required to adopt, within one year after the bill's enactment, rules and
regulations to provide interim guidelines for forest stewardship and other
management plans for publicly owned forested lands.  The DEP would be required
to cease approving such plans until the rules and regulations are adopted.  In
addition, the bill would require the DEP to adopt more comprehensive rules and
regulations concerning forest stewardship plans on public forests, within three
years after the bill's enactment.  The bill would establish certain
requirements for the rules and regulations, as enumerated in subsections b. and
c. of section 6 of the bill.  The bill would require any forest stewardship or
other management plan for a State-owned parcel of forested land, or for a
locally owned parcel of forested land that is larger than the size threshold
established by the DEP, to conform to the rules and regulations.  The bill
would require that this threshold be not less than 10 acres.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would direct the DEP
to establish a program to measure the deer population on publicly owned
forested lands.  The bill would also direct the DEP to begin developing
programs to reduce the deer population, including:  (1) establishing a pilot
program for commercial sale of venison; (2) studying the viability of
reintroducing natural predators into the State; (3) implementing fertility
control measures on deer populations, including sterilization; and (4) revising
current rules, regulations, and guidelines regarding deer baiting and feeding
practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would amend the
&quot;Natural Areas System Act,&quot; P.L.1975, c.33 (C.13:1B-15.12a) to
authorize the DEP to add additional acres of appropriate forested lands to the
State's Natural Areas System.  The bill would also require the DEP to develop
and implement an appropriate management plan for each natural area in the
Natural Areas System.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would amend the
&quot;Prescribed Burn Act,&quot; P.L.2018, c.107 (C.13:9-44.11 et seq.) to
require the DEP to develop and administer a program for prescribed burning on
public and private lands within 18 months after the bill's enactment.  The bill
would also require that certain provisions be included in the program.  Current
law authorizes the DEP to conduct prescribed burning or mechanical vegetation
removal on an area of land which is determined by the Forest Fire Service to be
in reasonable danger of wildfire.  This bill would require the DEP to conduct
prescribed burning or mechanical vegetation removal on an area of land which is
determined by the Forest Fire Service to be in danger of wildfire.  The bill
would also require the DEP to adopt rules and regulations to implement the
&quot;Prescribed Burn Act&quot; within 18 months after the bill's enactment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would
appropriate $50 million in constitutionally dedicated CBT revenues for those
portions of the bill's provisions that qualify as development or a stewardship
activity on lands permanently preserved for recreation and conservation
purposes.  The bill would also appropriate $10 million from Green Acres bond
act funds to implement the bill's provisions, provided that the use of the
moneys is consistent with the provisions of the relevant bond act.</p>
