<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span>
concerning the overcrowding of certain dwelling units, supplementing and
amending chapter 18 of Title 2A of the New Jersey Statutes, and amending
R.S.40:49-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b> <i>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)    a.   The
governing body of a municipality may adopt an ordinance authorizing the
issuance of summonses upon the owner-landlord and the tenants of a residential
rental unit in a building containing four or fewer residential rental units
alleging a zoning or housing code violation for illegal occupancy resulting in
overcrowding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The ordinance may
authorize the imposition of a fine upon a determination of illegal occupancy
resulting in overcrowding, in addition to any other fine provided by law, in
the amount of up to $2,500 for a first violation, $5,000 for a second violation
and $10,000 for each subsequent violation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Fines authorized
pursuant to subsection b. of this section may be imposed upon the
owner-landlord or the tenants, or both, dependent upon whether the conduct of
the owner-landlord or the tenants, or both, was the primary cause for the
illegal occupancy resulting in overcrowding, provided the provisions of
subsection h. of this section have been met.  In order for the conduct of the
tenants to be deemed the primary cause for the illegal occupancy, it must be
established (1) that the tenant signed a lease or was provided a written copy
of the rental policy in which the number of allowed occupants was specified,
(2) that the number of allowed occupants was within the standards established
by the applicable code requirements, or rental policy if a number was specified
in the lease, and (3) that any additional occupants in excess of the number of
occupants specified became residents of the rental unit without the expressed
consent of the owner-landlord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Owner-occupied property
shall be exempt from the fines authorized pursuant to subsection b. of this
section, except where the owner-landlord of the owner-occupied dwelling is
renting rooms or apartments in violation of local ordinances or State law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     An ordinance adopted
pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall provide for the issuance of a
notice of violation with a period of time to abate the alleged violation.  In
the event the violation is not abated within the period of time provided, a
summons against the owner-landlord or the tenant, or both, may be issued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Notwithstanding the provisions
of subsection e. of this section, if an owner-landlord has issued a notice to
cease to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>eliminate overcrowding or
unauthorized occupancy of a residential unit that is the subject of a notice of
violation, and the owner-landlord files a copy of the notice to cease and an
affidavit of good faith with the municipality, no summons shall issue against
an owner-landlord for six months from the date of service of the notice to
cease.  At the end of that six-month period, if the overcrowding or
unauthorized occupancy of the residential unit has not been eliminated, and no
eviction proceeding is pending, then a summons may be issued against the
owner-landlord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The service of a notice
to cease to eliminate overcrowding or unauthorized occupancy no more than six
months prior to the service of a summons or notice of violation under this
section, whether or not the owner-landlord prevails, shall serve as a defense by
the owner-landlord to any summons, notice, violation, action or proceeding under
this section against the owner-landlord before any court or administrative
agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    A fine shall not be
imposed upon an owner-landlord or a tenant unless the parties have been
afforded an opportunity for a hearing, before a court of competent
jurisdiction, allowing for independent determinations of the existence of
overcrowding and the responsibility for the overcrowding.   In order for it to
be determined that a tenant is responsible for the overcrowding, it must be
established (1) that the tenant signed a lease or was provided a written copy
of the rental policy in which the number of allowed occupants was specified,
(2) that the number of allowed occupants was within the standards established
by the applicable code requirements, or rental policy if a number was specified
in the lease, and (3) that any additional occupants in excess of the number of
occupants specified became residents of the rental unit without the expressed
consent of the owner-landlord. The municipal court and the Superior Court shall
have jurisdiction of proceedings for the enforcement of the fines provided by
this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     This section shall not
apply to a seasonal rental unit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     For the purposes of
this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;affidavit of good
faith&quot; means an owner-landlord's sworn statement that (1) the tenant
signed a lease or was provided a written copy of the rental policy in which the
number of intended occupants was specified, (2) that the number of allowed
occupants was within the standards established by the applicable code
requirements or rental policy, and (3) that any additional occupants in excess
of the number of occupants specified became residents of the rental unit
without the consent of the owner-landlord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;applicable code
requirements&quot; means standards governing the occupancy of housing space
adopted by the Department of Community Affairs pursuant to the State Housing
Code, promulgated pursuant to P.L.1966, c.168 (C.2A:42-74 et seq.) or the
&quot;Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law,&quot; P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et
seq.).</p>

term not exceeding 90 days; or by a fine not exceeding $2,000 <u>unless a fine

power to impose any fine, term of imprisonment, or period of community service
not less than the minimum and not exceeding the maximum fixed in such

the same ordinance and who was fined for the previous violation, shall be
sentenced by a court to an additional fine as a repeat offender.  The

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would allow
municipalities to adopt ordinances authorizing the issuance of summonses upon
certain landlords and tenants alleged to have violated occupancy requirements
resulting in overcrowding.  The bill would allow for the imposition of fines upon
a culpable landlord or tenant of up to $2,500 for a first violation, $5,000 for
a second violation, and $10,000 for each subsequent violation.  These fines
would be in addition to any other fines or penalties authorized by law.  The
bill would require that a hearing be held before any fines could be imposed. 
The bill would not be applicable to seasonal rentals or to buildings with more
than four residential rental units.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also clarify
existing law by distinguishing between illegal occupancies resulting in
overcrowding that are caused by landlords and those that are caused by tenants,
specifying that landlords are not obligated to pay tenant relocation costs when
the tenant's own conduct is the primary cause for the overcrowding.  This is consonant
with the holdings in <u>Haddock v. Dept. of Community Development, City of Passaic</u>, 217 <u>N.J.Super.</u> 592 (App. Div. 1987) and <u>M.C. Associates v. Shah</u>,
226 <u>N.J.Super.</u> 173 (App. Div. 1988).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also give
landlords the right to an expedited eviction when a tenant's conduct was the
primary cause of overcrowding in excess of the occupancy allowed under the
lease or State law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes new
standards to be utilized in determining whether a tenant has been the primary
cause of overcrowding or illegal occupancy.  The bill provides that in order
for the conduct of the tenants to be deemed the primary cause for the illegal
occupancy or overcrowding, it must be established (1) that the tenant signed a
lease or was provided a written copy of the rental policy in which the number
of intended occupants was specified, (2) that the number of allowed occupants
was within the standards established by the applicable code requirements, or
rental policy if a number was specified in the lease, and (3) that any
additional occupants in excess of the number of occupants specified became
residents of the rental unit without the expressed consent of the
owner-landlord.</p>
