STATEMENT N.J.S.22A:3-4 provides the fee schedule for assessment of courts costs in municipal proceedings.  The statute currently allows for an assessment up to but not exceeding $33 for all cases, including violations of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes and traffic ordinances.  This bill amends N.J.S.22A:3-4 by adding a provision which specifically grants municipal courts the discretion to assess the same court costs for charges of violations of Title 39 of the Revised Statues and traffic ordinances which are dismissed in accordance with a plea agreement.  This bill shifts a portion of the financial burden of operating municipal courts from local property tax payers to those accused of offenses over which the municipal courts have jurisdiction.
