<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 100 of P.L.1977,
c.110 (C.5:12-100) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     100.  a.  This act shall not
be construed to permit any gaming except the conduct of authorized games in a
casino room or through Internet gaming in accordance with this act and the
regulations promulgated hereunder and in a simulcasting facility to the extent
provided by the &quot;Casino Simulcasting Act,&quot; P.L.1992, c.19 (C.5:12-191
et al.). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the division approves the game of
keno as an authorized game pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-5),
as amended, keno tickets may be sold or redeemed in accordance with division
regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Gaming equipment shall
not be possessed, maintained or exhibited by any person on the premises of a
casino hotel except in a casino room, in the simulcasting facility, or in
restricted casino areas used for the inspection, repair or storage of such
equipment and specifically designated for that purpose by the casino licensee
with the approval of the division. Gaming equipment which supports the conduct
of gaming in a casino or simulcasting facility or through Internet gaming but
does not permit or require patron access, such as computers, or gaming software
or other gaming equipment used to conduct Internet gaming may be possessed and
maintained by a casino licensee or a qualified holding or intermediary company
of a casino licensee in restricted areas specifically approved by the division.
No gaming equipment shall be possessed, maintained, exhibited, brought into or
removed from a casino room or simulcasting facility by any person unless such
equipment is necessary to the conduct of an authorized game, has permanently
affixed, imprinted, impressed or engraved thereon an identification number or
symbol authorized by the division, is under the exclusive control of a casino
licensee or casino licensee's employees, or of any individually qualified
employee of a holding company or casino licensee and is brought into or removed
from the casino room or simulcasting facility following 24-hour prior notice
given to an authorized agent of the division.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of this section, computer equipment used by the slot system operator
of a multi-casino progressive slot system to link and communicate with the slot
machines of two or more casino licensees for the purpose of calculating and
displaying the amount of a progressive jackpot, monitoring the operation of the
system, and any other purpose that the division deems necessary and appropriate
to the operation or maintenance of the multi-casino progressive slot machine
system may, with the prior approval of the division, be possessed, maintained
and operated by the slot system operator either in a restricted area on the
premises of a casino hotel or in a secure facility inaccessible to the public
and specifically designed for that purpose off the premises of a casino hotel
but within the territorial limits of Atlantic County, New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a person may, with the prior approval of the division and under such terms and
conditions as may be required by the division, possess, maintain or exhibit
gaming equipment in any other area of the casino hotel, provided that such
equipment is used for nongaming purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of this act to the contrary, the division may, by regulation,
authorize the linking of slot machines of one or more casino licensees and slot
machines located in casinos licensed by another state of the United States. 
Wagering and account information for a multi-state slot system shall be
transmitted by the operator of such multi-state slot system to either a
restricted area on the premises of a casino hotel or to a secure facility
inaccessible to the public and specifically designed for that purpose off the
premises of a casino hotel but within the territorial limits of Atlantic
County, New Jersey, and from there to slot machines of New Jersey casino
licensees, provided all locations are approved by the division.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of this act to the contrary, the division may authorize electronic
versions of authorized games to be played within an approved hotel facility on
mobile gaming devices to be approved by the division, provided the player has
established an account with the casino licensee, the wager is placed by and the
winnings are paid to the patron in person within the approved hotel facility,
the mobile gaming device is inoperable outside the approved hotel facility, and
the division authorizes the device for mobile gaming; provided that the
division may establish any additional or more stringent licensing and other
regulatory requirements necessary for the proper implementation and conduct of
mobile gaming as authorized herein.  For the purposes of this provision, the
approved hotel facility shall include any area located within the property
boundaries of the casino hotel facility, including the swimming pool area and
an outdoor recreation area, where mobile gaming devices may be used by patrons
in accordance with this provision, but excluding parking garages or parking
areas of a casino hotel facility, provided that the division shall ascertain
and ensure, pursuant to rules and regulations issued by it to implement mobile
gaming pursuant to this provision, that mobile gaming shall not extend outside
of the property boundaries of the casino hotel facility.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Each casino hotel shall
contain a count room and such other secure facilities as may be required by the
division for the counting and storage of cash, coins, tokens, checks, plaques,
gaming vouchers, coupons, and other devices or items of value used in wagering
and approved by the division that are received in the conduct of gaming and for
the inspection, counting and storage of dice, cards, chips and other
representatives of value. The division shall promulgate regulations for the
security of drop boxes and other devices in which the foregoing items are
deposited at the gaming tables or in slot machines, and all areas wherein such
boxes and devices are kept while in use, which regulations may include certain
locking devices. Said drop boxes and other devices shall not be brought into or
removed from a casino room or simulcasting facility, or locked or unlocked,
except at such times, in such places, and according to such procedures as the
division may require. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    All chips used in gaming
shall be of such size and uniform color by denomination as the division shall
require by regulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     All gaming shall be
conducted according to rules promulgated by the division. All wagers and
pay-offs of winning wagers shall be made according to rules promulgated by the
division, which shall establish such limitations as may be necessary to assure
the vitality of casino operations and fair odds to patrons. Each slot machine

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Each casino licensee
shall make available in printed form to any patron upon request the complete
text of the rules of the division regarding games and the conduct of gaming,
pay-offs of winning wagers, an approximation of the odds of winning for each
wager, and such other advice to the player as the division shall require. Each
casino licensee shall prominently post within a casino room and simulcasting
facility, as appropriate, according to regulations of the division such
information about gaming rules, pay-offs of winning wagers, the odds of winning
for each wager, and such other advice to the player as the division shall
require.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Each gaming table shall
be equipped with a sign indicating the permissible minimum and maximum wagers
pertaining thereto.  All gaming and wagering offered through Internet gaming
shall display online the permissible minimum and maximum wagers pertaining
thereto.  It shall be unlawful for a casino licensee to require any wager to be
greater than the stated minimum or less than the stated maximum; provided,
however, that any wager actually made by a patron and not rejected by a casino
licensee prior to the commencement of play shall be treated as a valid wager.</p>

provided, no slot machine shall be used to conduct gaming unless it is
identical in all electrical, mechanical and other aspects to a model thereof
which has been specifically tested and licensed for use by the division. The
division shall also test any other gaming device, gaming equipment, gaming-related
device, hardware and software by which authorized gambling games are offered
through the Internet, or gross-revenue related device, such as a slot
management system, electronic transfer credit system or gaming voucher system
as it deems appropriate. In its discretion and for the purpose of expediting
the approval process, the division may utilize the services of a private
testing laboratory that has obtained a plenary license as a casino service
industry enterprise pursuant to subsection a. of section 92 of P.L.1977, c.110
(C.5:12-92) to perform the testing, and may also utilize applicable data from
any such private testing laboratory or from a governmental agency of a state
other than New Jersey authorized to regulate slot machines and other gaming devices,
gaming equipment, gaming-related devices and gross-revenue related devices used
in casino gaming, if the private testing laboratory or governmental agency uses
a testing methodology substantially similar to the methodology utilized by the
division. The division, in its discretion, may rely upon the data provided by
the private testing laboratory or governmental agency and adopt the conclusions
of such private testing laboratory or governmental agency regarding any
submitted device.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Except as otherwise
provided in paragraph (5) of subsection h. of this section, the division shall,
within 60 days of its receipt of a complete application for the testing of a
slot machine or other gaming equipment model, approve or reject the slot
machine or other gaming equipment model. In so doing, the division shall
specify whether and to what extent any data from a private testing laboratory
or governmental agency of a state other than New Jersey was used in reaching
its conclusions and recommendation. If the division is unable to complete the
testing of a slot machine or other gaming equipment model within this 60-day
period, the division may conditionally approve the slot machine or other gaming
equipment model for test use by a casino licensee provided that the division
represents that the use of the slot machine or other gaming equipment model
will not have a direct and materially adverse impact on the integrity of gaming
or the control of gross revenue. The division shall give priority to the
testing of slot machines or other gaming equipment which a casino licensee has
certified it will use in its casino in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The division shall, by
regulation, establish such technical standards for licensure of slot machines,
including mechanical and electrical reliability, security against tampering,
the comprehensibility of wagering, and noise and light levels, as it may deem
necessary to protect the player from fraud or deception and to insure the
integrity of gaming. The denominations of such machines shall be set by the
licensee; the licensee shall simultaneously notify the division of the
settings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The division shall, by
regulation, determine the permissible number and density of slot machines in a
licensed casino so as to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   promote optimum security
for casino operations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   avoid deception or

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   promote the comfort of
patrons;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   create and maintain a
gracious playing environment in the casino; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   encourage and preserve
competition in casino operations by assuring that a variety of gaming
opportunities is offered to the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any such regulation
promulgated by the division which determines the permissible number and density
of slot machines in a licensed casino shall provide that all casino floor space
and all space within a casino licensee's casino simulcasting facility shall be
included in any calculation of the permissible number and density of slot
machines in a licensed casino.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Any new gaming equipment
or simulcast wagering equipment that is submitted for testing to the division
or to an independent testing laboratory licensed pursuant to subsection a. of
section 92 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-92) prior to or simultaneously with
submission of such new equipment for testing in a jurisdiction other than New
Jersey, may, consistent with regulations promulgated by the division, be
deployed by a casino licensee on the casino floor 14 days after submission of
such equipment for testing. If the casino or casino service industry enterprise
licensee has not received approval for the equipment 14 days after submission
for testing, any interested casino licensee may, consistent with division
regulations, deploy the equipment on a field test basis, unless otherwise
directed by the director.</p>

equipment used to conduct Internet gaming shall be located, with the prior
approval of the division, in a restricted area on the premises of the casino
hotel or in another facility owned or leased by the casino licensee that is
secure, inaccessible to the public, and specifically designed to house that
equipment, and where the equipment shall be under the complete control of the
casino licensee or its Internet gaming affiliate, within the territorial limits
of Atlantic City, New Jersey.  Backup equipment used on a temporary basis
pursuant to rules established by the division to conduct Internet gaming may be
located outside the territorial limits of Atlantic City, provided no Internet
gaming shall occur unless a wager is accepted by a casino within the
territorial limits of Atlantic City, New Jersey.  All Internet wagers shall be
deemed to be placed when received in Atlantic City by the licensee.  Any
intermediate routing of electronic data in connection with a wager shall not
affect the fact that the wager is placed in Atlantic City.  For the purposes of
this section, a secure facility within Atlantic City that is owned or leased by
the casino licensee to house Internet gaming equipment shall be considered to
be part of the casino hotel facility notwithstanding that the facility may not
be contiguous with the premises of the casino hotel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No software, computer or other
gaming equipment shall be used to conduct Internet gaming unless it has been
specifically tested by the division.  The division may, in its discretion, and
for the purpose of expediting the approval process, refer testing to any
testing laboratory with a plenary license as a casino service industry
enterprise pursuant to subsection a. of section 92 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-92). 
The division shall give priority to the testing of software, computers or other
gaming equipment which a casino licensee has certified it will use to conduct
Internet gaming in this State.  The division shall, by regulation, establish
such technical standards for approval of software, computers and other gaming
equipment used to conduct Internet gaming, including mechanical, electrical or
program reliability, security against tampering, the comprehensibility of
wagering, and noise and light levels, as it may deem necessary to protect the
player from fraud or deception and to insure the integrity of gaming.  When
appropriate, the licensee shall set the denominations of Internet games and
shall simultaneously notify the division of the settings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No software, computer or other
gaming equipment shall be used to conduct Internet gaming unless it is able to
verify that a player placing a wager is physically present in this State.  The
division shall require by regulation that the equipment used by every licensee
to conduct Internet gaming is, in fact, verifying every player's physical
presence in this State each time a player logs onto a new playing session.</p>
