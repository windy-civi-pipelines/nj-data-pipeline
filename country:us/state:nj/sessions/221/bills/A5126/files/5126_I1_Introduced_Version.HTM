be issued an interim report and a final report on the progress of the
municipality toward achieving municipal rehabilitation and economic recovery,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would extend the
economic recovery term under the &quot;Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic
Recovery Act,&quot; P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.) (MRERA), by five
years.  This would extend the special governing procedures, economic benefits,
and additional oversight measures provided for a qualified municipality under
the MRERA.  Based upon the continuing unique fiscal distress facing the City of
  Camden, it is evident that a longer economic recovery term is necessary to
achieving the fiscal stability and economic revitalization goals of the MRERA.</p>
