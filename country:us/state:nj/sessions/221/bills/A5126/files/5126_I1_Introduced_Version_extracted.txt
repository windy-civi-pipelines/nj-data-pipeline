Notwithstanding the termination of the financial review board and supervision, all memorandums of understanding entered into by the municipality as a condition of receiving assistance under P.L.1987, c.75 (C.52:27D-118.24 et seq.) that require the municipality to implement any government, administrative, operational efficiency or oversight measures necessary for the fiscal recovery of the municipality as recommended by the director and approved by the Local Finance Board shall continue to have full force and effect.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.30, s.2.) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would extend the economic recovery term under the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act," P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.) (MRERA), by five years.  This would extend the special governing procedures, economic benefits, and additional oversight measures provided for a qualified municipality under the MRERA.  Based upon the continuing unique fiscal distress facing the City of Camden, it is evident that a longer economic recovery term is necessary to achieving the fiscal stability and economic revitalization goals of the MRERA.
