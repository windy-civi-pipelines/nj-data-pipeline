health care provider authorized to act on behalf of the provider who provided
services, for at least 72 hours following the provision of services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A health care provider

records prior to initiating contact with the patient, as required pursuant to
paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-63).  In

patient, to other health care providers.  For patients without a primary care
provider or other health care provider of record, the health care provider
engaging in telemedicine or telehealth may advise the patient to contact a
primary care provider, and, upon request by the patient, assist the patient
with locating a primary care provider or other in-person medical assistance
that, to the extent possible, is located within reasonable proximity to the
patient.  The health care provider engaging in telemedicine or telehealth shall
also refer the patient to appropriate follow up care where necessary, including
making appropriate referrals for emergency or <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>complimentary<b><span

telemedicine or telehealth, including the issuance of a prescription based on a
telemedicine or telehealth encounter, shall be held to the same standard of
care or practice standards as are applicable to in-person settings.  Unless the

the responses provided in an online questionnaire.</p>

Schedule II controlled dangerous substances through the use of telemedicine or

the patient is being prescribed the Schedule II controlled dangerous
substance.  However, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply, and the
in-person examination or review of a patient shall not be required, when a health
care provider is prescribing a stimulant which is a Schedule II controlled
dangerous substance for use by a minor patient under the age of 18, provided
that the health care provider is using interactive, real-time, two-way audio
and video technologies when treating the patient and the health care provider
