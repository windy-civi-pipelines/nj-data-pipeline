The holder of this license shall be entitled, subject to rules and regulations, to sell at retail or to serve any alcoholic beverages as the owner, operator, lessee, or concessionaire of a sporting facility by the glass or other receptacle or in original containers only on the premises of the sporting facility. Notwithstanding any other provision of Title 33 of the Revised Statutes and subject to conditions established by the director, the holder of this license may share direction and control of the premises to be licensed and share proceeds and profits from the sale of alcoholic beverages with the owner, operator, concessionaire, or lessee of the facility.  The holder of this license shall be permitted to conduct consumer wine, beer, and spirits tasting events and samplings for a fee or on a complimentary basis provided, however, the license holder complies with the provisions of section 3 of P.L.2009, c.216 (C.33:1-12d) and rules and regulations promulgated thereto.  Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, the holder of this license shall be entitled to establish an all-inclusive area within the licensed sporting facility, provided the all-inclusive area is limited to one area within the sporting facility for each game or event and the capacity of the all-inclusive area does not exceed 500 persons. The fee for this license shall be $2,500 for venues with a capacity of less than 7,500 persons; $5,000 for venues with a capacity of not less than 7,500 persons but not more than 14,999 persons; $7,500 for venues with a capacity of not less than 15,000 persons but not more than 22,499 persons; and $10,000 for venues with a capacity of 22,500 persons or more. For the purposes of this subsection: "Sporting facility" means a stadium, arena, team training facility, or similar venue located on public property where alcoholic beverages are served or sold at retail for consumption on the premises by the glass or other open receptacle or in original containers. "Team training facility" shall include team offices and team headquarters. (cf: P.L.2018, c.147, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill allows a person who held a seasonal retail consumption license prior to the bills effective date to surrender the license to the issuing authority, which then may exchange the license for a plenary retail consumption license.  This license will permit the licensee to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed premises throughout the entire year. Under the bill, a person who exchanges a seasonal retail consumption license would have the same privileges and be entitled to sell alcoholic beverages during the same times and days as other plenary retail consumption license holders in the same municipality. The fee to convert a seasonal license would be based upon the average sales price of plenary retail consumption licenses in the municipality in which the licensed premises is located during the two years immediately preceding the bills effective date. If a plenary retail consumption license has not been sold during the two years immediately preceding the bills effective date, the fee is to be based upon the average sales price of the last three plenary retail consumption licenses sold preceding the bills effective date. If the licensed premises is located within the boundaries of two or more municipalities, the highest average sale price of the two or more municipalities would be used to calculate the fee.  The calculation to determine the fee would not include de minimis or related party transfer sales.  The fee to convert a seasonal license would not exceed $250,000.  A person who exchanges a license would also be required to pay the same annual fee as a plenary retail consumption license holder. A seasonal retail consumption license allows for the sale of alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption for a limited time during the summer or winter season. A license issued during the summer season allows the licensee to serve alcoholic beverages from May 1 through November 14.  The holder of a winter seasonal license may sell alcoholic beverages from November 15 to April 30. A seasonal license is subject to the same population restrictions as a plenary retail consumption license, and is included in the total number of consumption licenses that a municipality may issue. A municipality may issue one of these licenses -both seasonal and plenary retail consumption- for each 3,000 persons residing in the municipality. Therefore, the bill does not allow for the issuance of new licenses, but rather allows seasonal licensees to sell alcoholic beverages during the entire year.

If a plenary retail consumption license has not been sold during the two years immediately preceding the bills effective date, the fee is to be based upon the average sales price of the last three plenary retail consumption licenses sold preceding the bills effective date. If the licensed premises is located within the boundaries of two or more municipalities, the highest average sale price of the two or more municipalities would be used to calculate the fee.  The calculation to determine the fee would not include de minimis or related party transfer sales.  The fee to convert a seasonal license would not exceed $250,000.  A person who exchanges a license would also be required to pay the same annual fee as a plenary retail consumption license holder. A seasonal retail consumption license allows for the sale of alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption for a limited time during the summer or winter season. A license issued during the summer season allows the licensee to serve alcoholic beverages from May 1 through November 14.  The holder of a winter seasonal license may sell alcoholic beverages from November 15 to April 30. A seasonal license is subject to the same population restrictions as a plenary retail consumption license, and is included in the total number of consumption licenses that a municipality may issue. A municipality may issue one of these licenses -both seasonal and plenary retail consumption- for each 3,000 persons residing in the municipality. Therefore, the bill does not allow for the issuance of new licenses, but rather allows seasonal licensees to sell alcoholic beverages during the entire year.
