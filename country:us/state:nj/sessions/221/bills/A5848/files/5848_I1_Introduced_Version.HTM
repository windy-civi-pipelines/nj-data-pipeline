(2)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2001, c.291) (3)   A person commits a crime of the first degree if the person causes or permits a child to engage in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act or to be portrayed in a sexually suggestive manner if the person knows, has reason to know, or intends that the prohibited act or portrayal may be photographed, filmed, reproduced, or reconstructed in any manner, including on the Internet, or may be part of an exhibition or performance. (4)   A person commits a crime of the second degree if the person photographs or films a child in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act or for portrayal in a sexually suggestive manner or who uses any device, including a computer, to reproduce or reconstruct the image of a child in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act or for portrayal in a sexually suggestive manner. (5) (a) A person commits a crime if, by any means, including, but not limited to, the Internet, the person: (i)    knowingly distributes an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child; (ii)   knowingly possesses an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child with the intent to distribute that item; or (iii)  knowingly stores or maintains an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child using a file-sharing program which is designated as available for searching by or copying to one or more other computers. In a prosecution under sub-subparagraph (iii) of this subparagraph, the State shall not be required to offer proof that an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child had actually been searched, copied, transmitted, or viewed by another user of the file-sharing program, or by any other person, and it shall be no defense that the defendant did not intend to distribute the item to another user of the file-sharing program or to any other person.  Nor shall the State be required to prove that the defendant was aware that the item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child was available for searching or copying to one or more other computers, and the defendant shall be strictly liable for failing to designate the item as not available for searching or copying by one or more other computers. A violation of this subparagraph that involves 1,000 or more items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child is a crime of the first degree; otherwise it is a crime of the second degree. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, a person whose offense under this subparagraph involved at least 25 but less than 1,000 items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, which shall be fixed at, or between, one-third and one-half of the sentence imposed by the court or five years, whichever is greater, during which the defendant shall be ineligible for parole. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, a person whose offense under this subparagraph involved 1,000 or more items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, which shall be fixed at, or between, one-third and one-half of the sentence imposed by the court or 10 years, whichever is greater, during which the defendant shall be ineligible for parole. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this subparagraph shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as set forth in N.J.S.2C:43-7.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, an offense is considered a second or subsequent offense if the actor has at any time been convicted pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, or under any similar statute of the United States, this State, or any other state for an offense that is substantially equivalent to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term possess includes receiving, viewing, or having under ones control, through any means, including the Internet. (b) (i) A person commits a crime of the first degree if  the person knowingly possesses, knowingly views, or knowingly has under  the persons control, through any means, including the Internet, 100,000 or more items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child. (ii)   A person commits a crime of the second degree if the person knowingly possesses, knowingly views, or knowingly has under the persons control, through any means, including the Internet, at least 1,000 but less than 100,000 items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child. (iii)  A person commits a crime of the third degree if the person knowingly possesses, knowingly views, or knowingly has under the persons control, through any means, including the Internet, less than 1,000 items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of N.J.S.2C:44-1, in any instance where a person was convicted of an offense under this subparagraph that involved 100 or more items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this subparagraph shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as set forth in N.J.S.2C:43-7.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, an offense is considered a second or subsequent offense if the actor has at any time been convicted pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, or under any similar statute of the United States, this State, or any other state for an offense that is substantially equivalent to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to preclude or limit any prosecution or conviction for the offense set forth in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph. (6)   For purposes of this subsection, a person who is depicted as or presents the appearance of being under the age of 18 in any photograph, film, videotape, computer program or file, video game, or any other reproduction or reconstruction shall be rebuttably presumed to be under the age of 18.  If the child who is depicted as engaging in, or who is caused to engage in, a prohibited sexual act or simulation of a prohibited sexual act or portrayed in a sexually suggestive manner is under the age of 18, the actor shall be strictly liable and it shall not be a defense that the actor did not know that the child was under the age of 18, nor shall it be a defense that the actor believed that the child was 18 years of age or older, even if such a mistaken belief was reasonable. (7)   For aggregation purposes, each depiction of the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be considered a separate item, provided that each depiction that is in the form of a photograph, picture, image, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be one item and each depiction that is in the form of a film, video, video-clip, movie, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be 10 separate items, and each individual act of distribution of an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be considered a separate item.  For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the act or acts constituting the violation occurred at the same time or at different times and, with respect to distribution, whether the act or acts of distribution were to the same person or several persons or occurred at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations.  For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the possession of such items occurred at the same time or at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations. (cf: P.L.2024, c.92, s.3) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the child endangerment statute, N.J.S.A.2C:24-4, to create a fourth degree crime of knowingly or recklessly causing or allowing a child to be subjected to sexual conduct through the use of automated interactive computer technology. Under current law, endangering the welfare of a child occurs when a person engages in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child.  Endangering is a second degree crime when committed by a person with a legal duty to care for the child, and is a third degree crime when committed by other persons.  Although the statute does not specify what types of acts constitute sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child, it has been well-settled by the courts of this State that the conduct can occur online or over the telephone without actual physical contact, and can include conversations with children that describe sexual activity. See, e.g., State v. Maxwell, 361 N.J. Super. 502 (Law Div. 2001); State v. Johnson, 460 N.J. Super. 481 (Law Div. 2019); State v. McInerney, 428 N.J. Super. 432 (App. Div. 2012). Under the bill, any person who knowingly or recklessly causes, or allows, a child to be subjected to sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child, through the persons creation, control, possession, manipulation, use, dissemination, sale, or promotion of any automated interactive computer technology that is capable of performing or simulating sexual conduct, is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. The bill provides an exception for AI technology that has safety features designed to stop a chatbot from simulating sexual conduct when it detects that a user is a child. A crime of the second degree is punishable by five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.  A crime of the third degree is punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. It is the sponsors intent that the bill would impose criminal penalties in situations where the creator of an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot knowingly or recklessly programs the chatbot to engage in simulated sexual chats with users who are children.  Such deliberate creation or misuse of AI chatbots, without regard to the safety of children, and their proliferation across social media platforms and the Internet, was reported in an April 26, 2025 article in the Wall Street Journal, entitled Metas Digital Companions Will Talk Sex with Users  Even Children.
