No municipality shall be required to utilize for affordable housing purposes land that is excluded from being designated as vacant land. When a vacant land adjustment is made pursuant to this section and a municipal affordable housing obligation is calculated based on this adjustment, the municipality shall be able to rely on this adjusted calculation in addressing its affordable housing obligation and making other planning decisions within the municipality for the duration of the 10-year period set forth in section 13 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-313). (cf: P.L.2008, c.46, s.39) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would clarify that a municipality which receives an adjustment to the calculation of its affordable housing obligation under the States Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A.52:27D-301, et seq., shall be entitled to rely on this adjusted calculation for the duration of the 10-year compliance period.  As such, should additional land become available during this time, a municipality would not be required to recalculate its affordable housing obligation nor means for addressing this obligation during that time.  This bill will allow a municipality to make sound planning decisions and address its affordable housing obligation because these decisions will be based on a definitive number that will not be subject to change for the duration of the compliance period.  The bill will afford municipalities a degree of certainty in making such decisions.
