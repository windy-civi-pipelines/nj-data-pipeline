<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 17 of P.L.2008,
c.127 (C.46:10B-51) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     17. a. (1) A creditor serving
a summons and complaint in an action to foreclose on a mortgage on residential
property in this State shall, within 10 days of serving the summons and
complaint, notify the municipal clerk and the mayor or other chief executive
officer of the municipality in which the property is located that a summons and
complaint in an action to foreclose on a mortgage has been filed against the
subject property.  The notice shall contain the full name, address, and
telephone number for the representative of the creditor who is responsible for
receiving complaints of property maintenance and code violations and the full
name and contact information for any person or entity retained by the creditor
or a representative of the creditor to be responsible for any care,
maintenance, security or upkeep of the property.  The notice may contain
information about more than one property, and shall be provided by mail or electronic
communication, at the discretion of the municipal clerk.  In the event the
creditor that has served a summons and complaint in an action to foreclose on a
residential property is located out-of-State, the notice shall also contain the
full name, address, and telephone number of an in-State representative or agent
who shall be responsible for the care, maintenance, security, and upkeep of the
exterior of the property if it becomes vacant and abandoned.  If the
municipality has appointed a public officer pursuant to P.L.1942, c.112
(C.40:48-2.3 et seq.), the municipal clerk shall forward a copy of the notice
to the public officer or shall otherwise provide it to any other local official
responsible for administration of any property maintenance or public nuisance
code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event that the property
being foreclosed on is an affordable unit pursuant to the &quot;Fair Housing
Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), then the creditor shall
identify that the property is subject to the &quot;Fair Housing Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The notice shall also include
the street address, lot and block number of the property, and the full name,
address, and telephone number of an individual located within the State who is
authorized to accept service on behalf of the creditor.  The notice shall be
provided to the municipal clerk and the mayor or other chief executive officer
within 10 days of service of a summons and complaint in an action to foreclose
on a mortgage against the subject property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If there is any change in the
name, address, or telephone number for a representative, agent, or individual
authorized to accept service on behalf of a creditor required to be provided in
a notice pursuant to this paragraph following the filing of the summons and
complaint, the creditor shall provide a notice to the applicable municipal
clerk containing the updated name, address, or telephone number within 10 days
of the change in that information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Within 30 days following
the effective date of P.L.2009, c.296 (C.2A:50-69 et al.), any creditor that
has initiated a foreclosure proceeding on any residential property which is
pending in Superior Court shall provide to the municipal clerk of the
municipality in which the property is located, a listing of all residential
properties in the municipality for which the creditor has foreclosure actions
pending by street address and lot and block number.  If the municipality has
appointed a public officer pursuant to P.L.1942, c.112 (C.40:48-2.3 et seq.),
the municipal clerk shall forward a copy of the notice to the public officer,
or shall otherwise provide it to any other local official responsible for
administration of any property maintenance or public nuisance code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If the owner of a
residential property vacates or abandons any property on which a foreclosure
proceeding has been initiated or if a residential property becomes vacant at
any point subsequent to the creditor's filing the summons and complaint in an
action to foreclose on a mortgage against the subject property, but prior to
vesting of title in the creditor or any other third party, and the exterior of
the property is found to be a nuisance or in violation of any applicable State
or local code, the local public officer, municipal clerk, or other authorized
municipal official shall notify the creditor or the representative or agent of
an out-of-State creditor, as applicable, which shall have the responsibility to
abate the nuisance or correct the violation in the same manner and to the same
extent as the title owner of the property, to such standard or specification as
may be required by State law or municipal ordinance.  The municipality shall
include a description of the conditions that gave rise to the violation with
the notice of violation and shall provide a period of not less than 30 days
from the creditor's receipt of the notice for the creditor to remedy the
violation.  If the creditor fails to remedy the violation within that time
period, the municipality may impose penalties allowed for the violation of
municipal ordinances pursuant to R.S.40:49-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If the municipality
expends public funds in order to abate a nuisance or correct a violation on a
residential property in situations in which the creditor was given notice
pursuant to the provisions of subsection b. of this section but failed to abate
the nuisance or correct the violation as directed, the municipality shall have
the same recourse against the creditor as it would have against the title owner
of the property, including but not limited to the recourse provided under
section 23 of P.L.2003, c.210 (C.55:19-100).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A creditor that
institutes a foreclosure proceeding on residential property pursuant to the
