CRUZ-PEREZ District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) SYNOPSIS Encourages institutions of higher education to address lack of representation of Hispanic and Latino leadership in higher education. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Senate Resolution encouraging institutions of higher education to address the lack of representation of Hispanic and Latino leadership in higher education. Whereas, In 2022, enrollment of Hispanic and Latino students in United States institutions of higher education rose to nearly 3.8 million students, and one out of four associate degrees and 16 percent of bachelors degrees were conferred to Hispanic students; and Whereas, Approximately 20 percent of the undergraduate population in the United States and 25 percent of the undergraduate population in New Jersey identifies as Hispanic or Latino, and postsecondary attendance among Hispanic and Latino students continues to increase each year; and Whereas, Despite the growing population of Hispanic and Latino students in higher education, the number of Hispanic and Latino college and university presidents remains disproportionately low; and Whereas, In 2023, only six percent of presidents of institutions of higher education in the United States identified as Hispanic or Latino, and there is currently only one Latino president leading an institution of higher education in New Jersey; and Whereas, The lack of representation of Hispanic and Latino individuals in leadership roles in higher education is of great concern as cultivating a leadership team that is reflective of the student body is critical to fostering an inclusive climate, understanding students diverse needs and interests, and ensuring students feel seen and heard; and Whereas, The challenges Hispanic and Latino students face in higher education underscore the need to better ensure college campuses are as inclusive as they are diverse; and Whereas, According to the 2024 State of Higher Education report, among the Hispanic students surveyed, 16 percent reported feeling disrespected, 14 percent felt discriminated against, 15 percent felt physically unsafe, and 16 percent felt psychologically unsafe during their postsecondary education, and 42 percent had considered withdrawing from their postsecondary education program; and Whereas, Addressing the low representation of Hispanic and Latino presidents at institutions of higher education can help improve the cultural competency of postsecondary education institutions to better support Hispanic and Latino students academic success and well-being; and Whereas, Hiring practices in institutions of higher education, which lack diversity on governing boards and in executive search firms, create barriers to advancing Hispanic and Latino individuals to presidential positions; and Whereas, Replacing outmoded hiring practices with concerted efforts to attract diverse talent in higher education, expand leadership development programs, and engage with organizations dedicated to the advancement of Hispanic and Latino leaders in higher education can help institutions overcome such barriers; and Whereas, Focusing on inclusive leadership and improving the representation of Hispanic and Latino presidents in higher education will benefit students, institutions, and society at large by fostering welcoming, diverse learning environments that promote critical thinking, break down stereotypes and reduce biases, and prepare graduates to navigate an increasingly globalized world; and Whereas, This House celebrates the increasingly diverse college student population representing the diversity of our broader communities and recognizes the importance of increasing the representation of Hispanic and Latino leadership in institutions of higher education in New Jersey and across the United States; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This House encourages institutions of higher education to address the lack of representation of Hispanic and Latino presidents in institutions of higher education by establishing and expanding leadership development programs, enhancing the diversity of governing boards and search committees, and actively engaging with organizations dedicated to the advancement of Hispanic and Latino leaders in higher education. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the New Jersey Secretary of Higher Education, the Executive Director of the New Jersey Association of State Colleges and Universities, the Chair of the New Jersey Council of County Colleges, and the United States Secretary of Education. STATEMENT This resolution encourages institutions of higher education in New Jersey and across the United States to address the lack of representation of Hispanic and Latino presidents of institutions of higher education. Colleges and universities in New Jersey and across the country have seen significant increases in enrollment of Hispanic and Latino undergraduate students in recent decades.  Currently, approximately 20 percent of undergraduate students in the United States and approximately 25 percent of undergraduate students in New Jersey identify as Hispanic or Latino. However, while college enrollments increasingly reflect the rich diversity of this State and nation as a whole, the leadership in institutions of higher education does not.  In 2023, only six percent of presidents of institutions of higher education in the United States identified as Hispanic or Latino and there is currently only one Latino president leading an institution of higher education in New Jersey. The lack of diverse leadership among institutions of higher education is of great concern as creating a leadership team that is reflective of the student body is critical to promoting inclusivity and belongingness among students, understanding students diverse needs and interests, and ensuring students feel safe, seen, and heard.  Thus, this resolution encourages institutions of higher education in New Jersey and across the United States to address the lack of representation of Hispanic and Latino leadership in higher education by establishing and expanding leadership development programs, enhancing the diversity of governing boards and search committees, and actively engaging with organizations dedicated to the advancement of Hispanic and Latino leaders in higher education0 .
