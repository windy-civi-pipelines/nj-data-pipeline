Each day a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.  The penalty shall be collected by the Secretary of Agriculture in a civil action by summary proceeding under the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  The Superior Court and the municipal court shall have jurisdiction over proceedings for the enforcement of the penalty established by this section. 2.    This act shall take effect on the 60th day after the date of enactment.

A person who violates the provisions in the bill would receive a written warning for the first offense, and a fine of $100 for a second and each subsequent offense.  Each day a violation continues would constitute a separate offense.  This bill would take effect on the 60th day after the date of enactment.
