The resident shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in the planning of his total care and medical treatment to the extent that his condition permits.  A resident shall have the right to refuse treatment.  A resident shall have the right to refuse to participate in experimental research, but if he chooses to participate, his informed written consent must be obtained.

(cf: P.L.2008, c.43) 7.    The Commissioner of Human Services, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall adopt rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill expands the types of residential long-term care facilities that are required to provide quarterly financial accounting statements to a resident, the residents next-of-kin, the residents guardian, if any, and, if the resident is a ward of the State, an individual whom the resident identified upon becoming a ward of the State to receive the quarterly statements.  Under this bill, residential long-term care facilities would be required to provide a written account of the residents funds, an itemized list of property deposited with the facility for the residents use, and all financial transactions with the resident, the residents next-of-kin or authorized representative, and any guardian appointed for the resident.  Moreover, these quarterly statements would report the amount of property in the residents account at the start and end of the accounting period, as well as a listing of all deposits and withdrawals, which transactions would be substantiated with copies of receipts to be provided to the resident, the residents next of kin or authorized representative, and any appointed guardian.  Facilities affected by this new requirement are:  nursing homes, assisted living facilities, comprehensive personal care homes, dementia care homes, inpatient psychiatric facilities, and continuing care residential communities. Under current law, only nursing homes, assisted living facilities and comprehensive personal care homes are required to provide quarterly accounting statements, and only to the resident or the residents guardian.  By requiring these residential care facilities to provide regular, detailed accounting statements to a resident, the residents next-of-kin, and a trusted representative named by a resident who is a ward of the State, the bills sponsor intends to make it more difficult for unscrupulous guardians or relatives to siphon money or other financial resources from a vulnerable individual who has become a ward of the State.  It is the hope of the sponsor that, by providing a clear financial accounting to the resident and the residents trusted advisors, any financial improprieties would be more readily identified and thwarted.

(cf: P.L.2013, c.167, s.3) 6.    Section 5 of P.L.1976, c.120 (C.30:13-5) is amended to read as follows: 5.    Every resident of a nursing home shall: a.     Have the right to manage his own financial affairs unless he or his guardian authorizes the administrator of the nursing home to manage such resident's financial affairs. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall be attested by a witness that is unconnected with the nursing home, its operations, its staff personnel and the administrator thereof, in any manner whatsoever. b.    Have the right to wear his own clothing.  If clothing is provided to the resident by the nursing home, it shall be of a proper fit. c.     Have the right to retain and use his personal property in his immediate living quarters, unless the nursing home can demonstrate that it is unsafe or impractical to do so. d.    Have the right to receive and send unopened correspondence and, upon request, to obtain assistance in the reading and writing of such correspondence. e.     Have the right to unaccompanied access to a telephone at a reasonable hour, including the right to a private phone at the resident's expense. f.     Have the right to privacy. g.    Have the right to retain the services of his own personal physician at his own expense or under a health care plan.  Every resident shall have the right to obtain from his own physician or the physician attached to the nursing home complete and current information concerning his medical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis in terms and language the resident can reasonably be expected to understand, except when the physician deems it medically inadvisable to give such information to the resident and records the reason for such decision in the resident's medical record.  In such a case, the physician shall inform the resident's next-of-kin or guardian. The resident shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in the planning of his total care and medical treatment to the extent that his condition permits.  A resident shall have the right to refuse treatment.  A resident shall have the right to refuse to participate in experimental research, but if he chooses to participate, his informed written consent must be obtained. Every resident shall have the right to confidentiality and privacy concerning his medical condition and treatment, except that records concerning said medical condition and treatment may be disclosed to another nursing home or health care facility on transfer, or as required by law or third-party payment contracts. h.    Have the right to unrestricted communication, including personal visitation with any persons of his choice, at any reasonable hour. i.     Have the right to present grievances on behalf of himself or others to the nursing home administrator, State governmental agencies or other persons without threat of discharge or reprisal in any form or manner whatsoever.  The administrator shall provide all residents or their guardians with the name, address, and telephone number of the appropriate State governmental office where complaints may be lodged.  Such telephone number shall be posted in a conspicuous place near every public telephone in the nursing home. j.     Have the right to a safe and decent living environment and considerate and respectful care that recognizes the dignity and individuality of the resident, including the right to expect and receive appropriate assessment, management and treatment of pain as an integral component of that person's care consistent with sound nursing and medical practices. k.    Have the right to refuse to perform services for the nursing home that are not included for therapeutic purposes in his plan of care as recorded in his medical record by his physician. l.     Have the right to reasonable opportunity for interaction with members of the opposite sex.  If married, the resident shall enjoy reasonable privacy in visits by his spouse and, if both are residents of the nursing home, they shall be afforded the opportunity, where feasible, to share a room, unless medically inadvisable. m.   Not be deprived of any constitutional, civil or legal right solely by reason of admission to a nursing home. n.    Have the right to receive, upon request, food that meets the resident's religious dietary requirements, provided that the request is made prior to or upon admission to the nursing home, and if the resident is not a Medicaid recipient, that the resident agrees to assume any additional cost incurred by the nursing home in order to meet those dietary requirements.  If the resident is a Medicaid recipient upon admission, or becomes eligible for Medicaid after admission, the nursing home shall include the cost of the religious dietary requirements in its Medicaid cost report for consideration under applicable reimbursement processes.  As used in this section, "Medicaid" means the Medicaid program established pursuant to P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.). o.    Have the right to receive a quarterly written account of the resident's funds, the itemized property deposited with the facility for the resident's use and safekeeping, and all financial transactions with the resident, next-of-kin, and guardian, if any, which account shall show the amount of property in the account at the beginning and end of the accounting period, as well as a list of all deposits and withdrawals, substantiated by receipts.  The written account and copies of receipts shall be given to the resident, the residents guardian, if any, the residents next-of-kin, and, if the resident has been adjudicated an incapacitated individual by a court of competent jurisdiction and is a ward of the State, any other individual whom the resident identified upon becoming a ward of the State to receive written accounts and copies of receipts. (cf: P.L.2008, c.43) 7.    The Commissioner of Human Services, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall adopt rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill expands the types of residential long-term care facilities that are required to provide quarterly financial accounting statements to a resident, the residents next-of-kin, the residents guardian, if any, and, if the resident is a ward of the State, an individual whom the resident identified upon becoming a ward of the State to receive the quarterly statements.  Under this bill, residential long-term care facilities would be required to provide a written account of the residents funds, an itemized list of property deposited with the facility for the residents use, and all financial transactions with the resident, the residents next-of-kin or authorized representative, and any guardian appointed for the resident.  Moreover, these quarterly statements would report the amount of property in the residents account at the start and end of the accounting period, as well as a listing of all deposits and withdrawals, which transactions would be substantiated with copies of receipts to be provided to the resident, the residents next of kin or authorized representative, and any appointed guardian.  Facilities affected by this new requirement are:  nursing homes, assisted living facilities, comprehensive personal care homes, dementia care homes, inpatient psychiatric facilities, and continuing care residential communities. Under current law, only nursing homes, assisted living facilities and comprehensive personal care homes are required to provide quarterly accounting statements, and only to the resident or the residents guardian.  By requiring these residential care facilities to provide regular, detailed accounting statements to a resident, the residents next-of-kin, and a trusted representative named by a resident who is a ward of the State, the bills sponsor intends to make it more difficult for unscrupulous guardians or relatives to siphon money or other financial resources from a vulnerable individual who has become a ward of the State.  It is the hope of the sponsor that, by providing a clear financial accounting to the resident and the residents trusted advisors, any financial improprieties would be more readily identified and thwarted.
