The department may provide financial assistance to approved applicants in the form of grants or loans in such amounts as the department deems appropriate from the Local Farm Roadway Improvement Fund established pursuant to subsection h. of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-25). 2.    Section 25 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-25) is amended as follows: 25.  a.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subtitle 4 of Title 27 of the Revised Statutes and P.L.1946, c.301 (C.27:15A-1 et seq.), the commissioner may, pursuant to appropriations or authorizations being made from time to time by the Legislature according to law, allocate to counties and municipalities funds for the planning, acquisition, engineering, construction, reconstruction, repair, resurfacing and rehabilitation of public highways and the planning, acquisition, engineering, construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance and rehabilitation of public transportation projects and of other transportation projects which a county or municipality may be authorized by law to undertake. b.    The commissioner shall, pursuant to appropriations or authorizations being made from time to time by the Legislature according to law, allocate at his discretion State aid to counties and municipalities for transportation projects, except that the amount to be appropriated for this program shall be seven percent of the total amount appropriated pursuant to subsection d. of this section.  This State aid shall be set aside prior to any formula allocations provided for in subsections c., d., e., f., and g. of this section, and shall be known as the "Local Aid Infrastructure Fund."  In the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2016, any amount appropriated to the Local Aid Infrastructure Fund above $7,500,000 shall be deposited into the State Transportation Infrastructure Bank Fund, established pursuant to section 34 of P.L.2016, c.56 (C.58:11B-10.4). c.     The commissioner shall, pursuant to appropriations or authorizations being made from time to time by the Legislature according to law and pursuant to the provisions of subsections b. and d. of this section, allocate State aid to municipalities for public highways under their jurisdiction.  The amount to be appropriated shall be allocated on the basis of the following distribution factor: Pc                    Cm DF =                           ____ +     ____ Ps                 Sm where, DF equals the distribution factor Pc equals county population Ps equals State population Cm equals municipal road mileage within the county Sm equals municipal road mileage within the State.
