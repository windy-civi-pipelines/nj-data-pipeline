A member who did not participate in such operations for a minimum of eight hours shall be eligible for the presumption provided that: the member participated in the rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations at the World Trade Center site between September 11, 2001 and September 12, 2001; the member sustained a documented physical injury at the World Trade Center site between September 11, 2001 and September 12, 2001 that is a qualifying condition or impairment of health resulting in a disability to the member that prevented the member from continuing to participate in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations for a minimum of eight hours; and the documented physical injury that resulted in a disability to the member that prevented the member from continuing to participate in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations for a minimum of eight hours is the qualifying condition or impairment of health for which the member seeks a presumption under this subsection. In order to be eligible for the presumption provided under this subsection, a member shall have successfully passed a physical examination for entry into public service which failed to disclose evidence of the qualifying condition or impairment of health that formed the basis for the permanent and total disability. (3)   A member who participated in the World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations for a minimum of eight hours and subsequently retired on a service retirement or an ordinary disability retirement and thereafter incurred a disability caused by a qualifying condition or impairment of health which the medical board determines to be caused by participation in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations shall be eligible to apply to the board of trustees to have the retiree's retirement allowance recalculated as an accidental disability retirement allowance for benefit payments on or after the date of the application, provided the retiree filed an application for such recalculation within 30 days of the date that the retiree knew or should have known of the existence of such disability and its relation to the rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations. In order to be eligible for such recalculation, the retiree shall have successfully passed a physical examination for entry into public service which failed to disclose evidence of the qualifying condition or impairment of health that formed the basis for the disability. (4)   The board of trustees shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection and shall notify members and retirants in the retirement system of the enactment of this act, P.L.2019, c.157, within 30 days of enactment. A member or retiree shall not be eligible for the presumption or recalculation under this subsection unless within two years of the effective date of this act, P.L.2019, c.157, the member or retiree files a written and sworn statement with the retirement system on a form provided by the board of trustees thereof indicating the dates and locations of service. (5)   This subsection shall apply regardless of whether the member or retiree, who is otherwise eligible, was enrolled in the retirement system at the time of participation in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations as specified herein (cf:  P.L.2019, c.157, s.3) 4.    Section 28 of P.L.1965, c. 89 (C.53:5A-28) is amended to read as follows: 28   a.   Should a member, after having established 10 years of creditable service  as a full time commissioned officer, noncommissioned officer or trooper of the  Division of State Police, be separated voluntarily or involuntarily from the  service, before reaching age 55, or before reaching age 60 for a member who is separated voluntarily or involuntarily from the  service after the effective date of P.L. , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and not by removal for cause on charges of  misconduct or delinquency, such person may elect to receive the payments  provided for in section 26 or 27 or a deferred retirement allowance, beginning  on the first day of the month following his attainment of age 55, or age 60 as appropriate, and the filing  of an application therefor, which shall consist of: (1)   An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his aggregate contributions at the time of his severance from the service, and (2)   A pension in the amount which, when added to the member's annuity, will  provide a total retirement allowance of 2% of his final compensation multiplied  by his number of years of creditable service up to 25 plus 1% of his final  compensation multiplied by his number of years of creditable service over 25,  provided that such inactive member may elect to receive payments provided under  section 26 or 27 if he had qualified under that latter section at the time of  leaving service, except that in order to avail himself of the option, he must  exercise such option at least 1 month before the effective date of his  retirement.  If such inactive member shall die before attaining age 55, or age 60 as appropriate, his aggregate contributions shall be paid in accordance with section 26 and, in addition if such inactive member shall die after attaining age 55, or age 60 as appropriate, but before  filing an application for retirement benefits pursuant to this section or  section 27 and for which benefits he would have qualified and has not withdrawn  his aggregate contributions, or in the event of death after retirement, an  amount equal to one-half of the final compensation received by the member shall  be paid to such member's beneficiary. b.    (Deleted by amendment.) c.     Any member who, having elected to receive a deferred retirement allowance, again becomes an employee covered by the retirement system while under the age of 55, under age 60 as appropriate, shall thereupon be reenrolled.  He shall be credited with all service as a member standing to his credit at the time of his election to receive a deferred retirement allowance. (cf: P.L.1981, c.177, s.6) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill raises the mandatory retirement age for members of the State Police Retirement System from 55 to 60.
