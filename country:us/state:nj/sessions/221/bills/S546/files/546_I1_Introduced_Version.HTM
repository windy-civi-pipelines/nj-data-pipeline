members of the State Police Retirement System and amending P.L.1965, c.89.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 8 of P.L.1965,
c.89 (C.53:5A-8) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    a.   The Legislature
finds and declares that the public health, safety and welfare require the
ongoing health and fitness of all members of the New Jersey State Police so
that they may safely and efficiently protect the public.  The Legislature
further finds and declares that such continued health and fitness cannot be
determined except with reference to age, and therefore finds and concludes that
retirement of all members of the State Police at age 55, except as provided for
in subsection c. of this section, <u>and that, after the effective date of
P.L.   , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), retirement of all
members of the State Police at age 60,</u> shall constitute a bona fide
occupational qualification which is reasonably necessary to the normal
operation of the State Police, which qualification the Legislature hereby
promulgates and establishes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Any member of the
retirement system may retire on a service retirement allowance upon having
established at least 20 years of creditable service in the retirement system,
which includes the creditable service of those members appointed to the
Division of State Police under section 3 of P.L.1983, c.403 (C.39:2-9.3) and
the creditable service of those members appointed to the Division of State
Police under section 1 of P.L.1997, c.19 (C.53:1-8.2).  Upon the filing of a
written and duly executed application with the retirement system, setting forth
at what time, not less than one month subsequent to the filing thereof, he
desires to be retired, any such member retiring for service shall receive a
service retirement allowance which shall consist of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   An annuity which shall
be the actuarial equivalent of his aggregate contributions; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A pension in the amount
which, when added to the member's annuity, will provide a total retirement
allowance of 50% of his final compensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Except for the
Superintendent of State Police, any member of the retirement system, including
a member appointed to the State Police under section 3 of P.L.1983, c.403
(C.39:2-9.3) and a member appointed to the State Police under section 1 of
P.L.1997, c.19 (C.53:1-8.2), who has attained the age of 55 years, shall be
retired forthwith on the first day of the next calendar month following the
effective date of this 1985 amendatory act.  Any member of the retirement
system so retired shall receive a service retirement allowance pursuant to this
section or section 27 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-27), as appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Any member of the
retirement system who is required to retire pursuant to subsection c. of this
section and who has more than 20 but fewer than 25 years of creditable service
at the time of retirement shall be entitled to continued health benefits
coverage during retirement as provided in the &quot;New Jersey State Health
Benefits Program Act,&quot; P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.). 
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 8 of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.32),
or any other law enacted prior to the effective date of P.L.2018, c.63
requiring persons who have retired from public employment to make contributions
toward the cost of health care benefits coverage in retirement, to the
contrary, the State shall pay in full the premium or periodic charge for the
benefits provided under this subsection to a member retiring under subsection
c. of this section with fewer than 25 years of service credited in the
retirement system, and the member's dependents covered under the program, but
not including survivors.  This provision shall be the sole provision applicable
to these specified members of the retirement system with regard to the
obligations of the State for the payment of premiums and periodic charges and
any contributions toward the cost of health care benefits coverage during
retirement for a retired member and the member's dependents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Any member of the
retirement system as of the effective date of P.L.1985, c.175 who is required
to retire pursuant to subsection c. of this section shall be entitled to the
retirement allowance provided for by subsection b. of this section,
notwithstanding that the member shall have fewer than 20 years' creditable
service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Any member of the
retirement system as of the effective date of P.L.1985, c.175 who is required
to retire pursuant to subsection c. of this section and who has more than 20
but less than 25 years of creditable service at the time of retirement shall be
entitled to the retirement allowance provided for by subsection b. of this
section plus 3% of his final compensation multiplied by the number of years of
creditable service over 20 but not over 25.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Upon the receipt of
proper proofs of the death of a member who has retired on a service retirement
allowance, there shall be paid to the member's beneficiary an amount equal to
one-half of the final compensation received by the member.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2019, c.251, s.2)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 9 of P.L.1965,
c.89 (C.53:5A-9) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.    a.   Upon the written
application by a member in service, by one acting in his behalf or by the
State, any member, under 55 years of age, <u>or under 60 years of age for an application
submitted after the effective date of P.L.   , c.    (pending before the Legislature
as this bill),</u> who has had four or more years of creditable service as a
State policeman, or four or more years of creditable service as a person
formerly employed by the Division of Motor Vehicles or the Division of State
Police prior to appointment as provided in section 3 of P.L.1983, c.403
