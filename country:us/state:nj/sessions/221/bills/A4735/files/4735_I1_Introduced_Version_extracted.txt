STATEMENT This bill establishes the Illegal Alien Healthcare Transparency Act.  This bill requires health care facilities to inquire and report on the immigration status of patients. Under the bill, the Department of Health will require each licensed health care facility to inquire about the citizenship or immigration status of each of the health care facilitys patients and to submit a monthly report to the department on the citizenship and immigration status of the health care facilitys patients and the health care facilitys monthly cost of care provided to illegal aliens.  Any data and information contained in the report will be in aggregate form and the report will not contain the personal identifying information of any patient.  The department will make each report publicly available on the departments Internet website. The bill makes it unlawful and a crime of the fourth degree for any patient to knowingly and willingly make a false statement or representation of a material fact concerning the patients citizenship or immigration status in any document or electronic transmission necessary for a health care facility to complete an inquiry on the patients citizenship or immigration status. Presently, the United States collects some data on the use of emergency healthcare services by illegal aliens.  However, there is a lack of transparency on the full cost of healthcare being utilized by illegal aliens.  It is the sponsors belief that having more data on the healthcare use of illegal aliens would assist New Jersey in computing the actual cost of illegal aliens use of government services.
