the department's overall Capital Investment Strategy and subsequent annual
Transportation Capital Programs submitted to the Legislature for approval
pursuant to this section.  This master plan shall, to the extent practicable,
conform to all federal requirements for Statewide transportation planning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Department of
Transportation, in conjunction with the New Jersey Transit Corporation, the New
Jersey Turnpike Authority, and the South Jersey Transportation Authority, shall
prepare a &quot;Statewide Capital Investment Strategy&quot; for at least a
five-year period which shall contain, at a minimum, a statement of the goals of
the department, the corporation, and the toll road authorities in major
selected policy areas and the means by which the goals are to be attained
during that period, using quantitative measures where appropriate.  The
Statewide Capital Investment Strategy may be updated and submitted no later
than March 1 of each year.  The Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall
provide for a multi-modal, intermodal, seamless, technologically advanced, and
secure transportation system.  It shall recommend investment for major program
categories, set overall goals for investment in the State's infrastructure, and
develop program targets and performance measures.  It may rely on
infrastructure management systems as developed by the department to assess
bridge conditions, pavement conditions, bridge, traffic and pedestrian safety,
traffic congestion and public transit facilities. With respect to pavement
conditions, the department shall set as a priority the utilization of efficient
cost-effective materials and treatments as stated in section 9 of P.L.2000,
c.73 (C.27:1B-21.22). In the event that there exist appropriate circumstances
for the use of micro-surfacing and cold-in-place recycling, the department
shall establish as a special priority the use of these materials and surface
treatments.  The goals of the Capital Investment Strategy shall include, but
not be limited to, reduction of vehicular and pedestrian accidents, reduction
in the backlog of projects, including one-half of the structurally deficient
bridge repair projects and pavement deficiencies, and an increase in lane miles
of bicycle paths, with a goal of constructing an additional 1,000 lane miles of
bicycle paths in five years to reduce traffic congestion and for recreational
uses. The construction of bicycle and pedestrian lanes, paths and facilities
shall be subject to no stricter environmental requirements than are provided
pursuant to federal law and regulations for such lanes, paths and facilities,
notwithstanding the provisions to the contrary of State law and regulations,
including State Executive Order No. 215 of 1989.  With respect to the New
Jersey Transit Corporation, the Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall
deal with the corporation's overall goal to keep the public transportation
system in a state of good repair and, more specifically, in the area of bus
transportation, present a strategy and a preliminary timetable for the
replacement of the current diesel bus fleet with a fleet of buses which have
reduced emission of air pollutants.  The corporation shall consider the
feasibility of buses with improved pollution controls and that reduce
particulate emissions and buses powered by fuel other than conventional diesel
fuel<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>,
such as compressed natural gas vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles,
biodiesel vehicles, vehicles operated on ultra low sulfur fuel, and vehicles
operated on any other bus fuel approved by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>. 
The corporation may consider as part of its strategy, cooperative efforts with
bus manufacturers, and the solicitation of federal support, in developing a
&quot;clean bus&quot; with air pollution controls superior to currently
available technology.  For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007 <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and each
fiscal year thereafter<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>through the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2029</u>, all buses purchased by
the New Jersey Transit Corporation shall be buses with improved pollution
controls and that reduce particulate emissions, or buses powered by fuel other
than conventional diesel fuel<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>,
such as compressed natural gas vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles,
biodiesel vehicles, vehicles operated on ultra low sulfur fuel, or vehicles
operated on any other bus fuel approved by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>. 
In the event that the corporation is not able to meet the bus purchase
requirements set forth in this section with respect to any fiscal year <u>prior
to the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2030</u>, prior to the commencement of the
fiscal year, the board of the corporation shall, by resolution, submit a report
to the Legislature detailing its inability to meet the requirements and the
reasons therefor and shall submit the report to the Senate and General Assembly
when both houses are in session, including therein a request to be exempted
from the bus purchase requirements of this section with regard to the fiscal
year in question.  The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General
Assembly shall cause the date of submission to be entered upon the Senate
Journal and the Minutes of the General Assembly.  If a joint resolution
approving the exemption is passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor
prior to the commencement of the fiscal year in question, the corporation shall
be exempt from the requirements for that fiscal year.  <u>Commencing with the
State fiscal year beginning July 1, 2030, and each State fiscal year
thereafter, the purchase of motorbuses, including the transition to lower
emission motorbuses, shall be governed by the provisions of section 2 of
P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the fiscal year beginning

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires public
entities including the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ Transit) to
transition to electric motorbuses. Beginning in FY 2031, 25 percent of the new
motorbuses purchased by each public entity for regular route service that is
provided by a public entity must be electric motorbuses.  Beginning in FY 2036,
all new motorbuses purchased by each public entity for regular route service
provided by a public entity must be electric motorbuses.  The bill also
requires public entities to begin preparing for this transition starting in the
first State fiscal year following the effective date of the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires NJ Transit
and county transportation services to each provide a report to the Governor and
Legislature by March 1, 2025, which documents their progress in preparing for
the gradual transition to electric motorbuses beginning in FY 2031.  The report
is to include updates on the preparations these entities began making to
transition to electric motorbuses, the status of each entity in training staff
and equipping facilities for the use of electric motorbuses, a schedule for
their planned transition to electric motorbuses, an analysis of whether
electric motorbuses will be sufficient to replace the existing motorbus fleet,
and the potential fiscal impact of the transition to an electric motorbus fleet
relative to maintenance and upkeep of the fleet with non-electric motorbuses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends the
requirements of the Statewide Capital Investment Strategy as they apply to NJ
Transit.  Currently, NJ Transit is required to transition its diesel bus fleet
to lower emission alternatives.  This bill sunsets that requirement in FY 2030,
so that beginning in FY 2031, the requirements under this bill for the
electrification of the motorbus fleet are put in place, which will eventually
result in a zero emission fleet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill appropriates $82
million each year starting on the first State fiscal year after the bill is
enacted and ending before FY 2036.  The bill appropriates money to NJ Transit
from the societal benefits charge and any revenues generated from the sale of
carbon emission allowances resulting from the States participation in the
Transportation and Climate Initiative Program.  The bill requires the money to be
equitably divided between public entities operating motorbus regular route
service to prepare for the transition to electric motorbuses and to purchase
electric motorbuses.</p>
