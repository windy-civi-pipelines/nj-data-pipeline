for the election and recall of executive board members of common interest
communities and requires association member approval for certain expenditures.

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require
associations to hold elections at two-year intervals under the administration of
an independent election committee of association members who are neither
current executive board members nor candidates for the executive board and
would restrict the maximum terms of executive board members to two years.  The
bill would also limit the size of executive boards to three members for
communities comprised of less than 11 homes, provide a default size of five
members for the executive boards of all other communities unless the bylaws
provide otherwise, and extend the election provisions of the &quot;Planned Real
Estate Development Full Disclosure Act,&quot; P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-21 et
seq.) to include associations with less than 50 units.  Further, the bill would
clarify an associations election notice obligations by requiring two written
notices of an election: the first, to notify members of the election, election
rules, and to allow for nominations and interested candidate applications; the
second, to provide association members with the official list of candidates, election
information, and absentee and proxy ballots.  An association would be required
to be send the first notice no later than 60 days prior to the election and the
second no more than 30 nor less than 14 days prior to the election.</p>

authority to investigate election challenges and to report substantiated
allegations of vote tampering or fraud to the Division of Housing and
Development in the Department of Community Affairs (agency), unless the
allegations involve the election committee or its members directly.  In such
case, any aggrieved association member could report only those allegations
directly concerning the election committee to the agency, which would have
discretion to conduct its own investigation.  If the agency determines that the
associations management, legal team, candidates, or the election committee are
guilty of vote tampering or fraud, the election would be considered void,

expenditures) require 30 days notice to be provided to all association members
prior to a formal vote on the expenditures, which require approval by a
majority of association members in good standing, or greater if required by the
governing documents.  The bill contains an exception that allows an association
to make qualifying expenditures to respond to an emergency.  The bill contains
an additional exception allowing the association to make qualifying
expenditures that are necessary to comply with statutory and regulatory
obligations, on condition that: (1) there are no other less expensive
alternatives that receive approval by a majority of association members, or
greater if required by the governing documents, and (2) the association
provides a written report to all association members of the qualifying
expenditures and votes at which the qualifying expenditures and less expensive
