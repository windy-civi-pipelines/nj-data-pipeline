<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     P.L.2009, c.82 (C.45:22A-46.3
et seq.) established a procedure by which an age-restricted housing development
previously approved for construction by a municipal or regional planning board,
zoning board of adjustment, or joint land use board may convert to a
development that would be marketed with no age restrictions.  The law requires
that the approving board approve an application for such a conversion if the
developer satisfied certain requirements, and if the approving board determines
that the conversion can be granted without substantial detriment to the public
good and not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and
zoning ordinance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The conversion of an
age-restricted development to a non-restricted development has the potential to
increase the number of students enrolled in a districts public schools.  This
bill provides converted development assistance aid to a school district in
which such a conversion has occurred.  Specifically, the school district would
receive an amount equal to the lesser of: 1) its actual cost per pupil, or 2)
the per pupil tuition rate adopted by the school districts board of education
for the school year, multiplied by the increase in its resident enrollment
between the last school year prior to a dwelling unit within a converted
development being occupied and the budget year.  However, the change in
enrollment used to determine the aid may not exceed the total number of
students who reside in a converted development.</p>
