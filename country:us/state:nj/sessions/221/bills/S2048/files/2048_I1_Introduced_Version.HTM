<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises various
portions of law establishing the School Regionalization Efficiency Program
(SREP), which was enacted as P.L.2021, c.402. The grant program supports public
school districts and governing bodies across New Jersey who wish to study the
feasibility of school district regionalization and consolidation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Regarding the administering of
the grant program, the bill does the following:</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

enactment of P.L.2021, c.402, for which the amount of a prior grant award
disbursed by the Division of Local Government Services (DLGS) in the Department
of Community Affairs is less than the total cost of the study;</p>

of a grant application, either notify each non-participating district that is
proposed to be included in a regionalization feasibility study or require the
applicant to notify each non-participating district, to ensure that the
district is afforded an opportunity to provide comment on the proposed
regionalization.</p>

timeline by which a school district receiving approval or preliminary approval
under the SREP would experience State aid reductions pursuant to current law,
by a period of four additional years beyond what is provided for under the
current State aid reduction timeline. The bill expands eligibility for this
modified State aid schedule to a school district that is a participating
district under an application for which a lead district has successfully
completed a prior grant agreement with the DLGS for the purposes of completing
a feasibility study for school district regionalization. The bill also provides
various restrictions under which a district would not be eligible for this
modified schedule: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that a vote on a proposal to enlarge a regional school district may be held at
the November school election.</p>
