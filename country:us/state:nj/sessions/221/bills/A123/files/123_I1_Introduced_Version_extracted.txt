STATEMENT This bill would require the State to annually reimburse municipalities for a portion of forgone property tax revenue attributable to real property owned by veterans who are permanently and totally disabled and receive a total property tax exemption under State law. Currently, the State is not required to reimburse municipalities for any part of the lost property tax revenue attributable to that property tax exemption.  This bill would require the State to annually reimburse each municipality in which permanently and totally disabled veterans reside and own real property in an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount of any disabled veterans total property tax exemptions granted in the taxing district, plus an additional two percent of that amount as a reimbursement for municipal administrative costs.
