STATEMENT The bill places certain requirements regarding the use of prior authorization of health benefits on carriers and utilization review entities acting on behalf of carriers.  The bill defines carrier to include insurance companies, health, hospital, and medical service corporations, health maintenance organizations, and the State Health Benefits Program and School Employees Health Benefits Program. The bill also adds a definition of enrollee and medications for opioid use disorder and adds mental health services and behavioral health services to the definition of urgent health care service. The bill requires a utilization review entity to make certain disclosures regarding its prior authorization requirements and restrictions, on its website and in writing, including certain statistics concerning approvals and denials, as set forth in the bill.  This includes data on whether prior authorization determinations were appealed, approved or denied on appeal, and the time between submission of prior authorization requests and the determination. The bill also requires that a utilization review entity ensure that a physician make any adverse determination and specifies the qualifications the physician is to meet to make the determination. Additionally, questions over the medical necessity of a health care service are to be conveyed from the utilization review entity to the physician of the enrollee who is to receive the health care service and that physician is granted the opportunity to discuss the service with the physician who will determine its authorization for the review entity.  The utilization review entity is to also ensure that a physician who is to review an appeal of an adverse determination meets certain requirements delineated in the bill. The bill provides that if a utilization review entity requires prior authorization of a covered service, the utilization review entity shall make a prior authorization or adverse determination and notify the subscriber (also commonly known as a policyholder) and the subscribers health care provider of the prior authorization or adverse determination within one calendar day of obtaining all necessary information to make the prior authorization or adverse determination. Necessary information is considered received if it is transmitted to the utilization review entity after being sent by electronic portal, e-mail, facsimile, telephone or other means of communication. The bill provides that a utilization review entity is to render a prior authorization or adverse determination concerning an urgent health care service, and notify the subscriber and the subscribers health care provider of that prior authorization or adverse determination, not later than 24 hours after receiving all information needed to complete the review of the requested service. The bill further adds that medications for opioid use disorder do not require prior authorization. The bill requires a utilization review entity to adhere to certain practices with respect to authorization of emergency health care services, establishes a presumption that these services are medically necessary in some situations, and deems certain services to be approved under certain circumstances. The bill also prohibits a utilization review entity from: · Requiring a health care provider offering services to a covered person to participate in a step therapy protocol if the provider deems that the step therapy protocol is not in the covered persons best interests; · Requiring that a health care provider first obtain a waiver, exception, or other override when deeming a step therapy protocol to not be in a covered persons best interests; or · Sanctioning or otherwise penalizing a health care provider for recommending or issuing a prescription, performing or recommending a procedure, or performing a test that may conflict with the step therapy protocol of the carrier. Additionally, the bill establishes requirements regarding the prior authorization of certain medications. The bill further provides that a utilization review entity is not to revoke, limit, condition, or restrict a prior authorization if care is provided within 45 business days from the date the health care provider received the prior authorization.  A prior authorization is to be valid for purposes of authorizing the health care provider to provide care for a period of one year from the date the health care provider receives the prior authorization.  The bill also includes a provision authorizing a utilization review entity to honor a previous prior authorization for the initial 60 days of coverage under a new health plan of an enrollee, grant the entity the right to review the prior authorization during the initial 60 days, and prohibit any change in coverage or approval criteria for prior authorization from impacting an enrollees access to the service authorized previously if the service was authorized before the effective date of the change for the remainder of the enrollees plan year. Any failure by a utilization review entity to comply with a deadline or other requirement under the provisions of the bill is to result in any health care services subject to review being automatically deemed authorized. Finally, the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance is to promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), including any penalties or enforcement provisions, that the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the bill.

(6)    If a utilization review entity requires prior authorization for a health care service for the treatment of a chronic or long-term care condition, the prior authorization shall remain valid for the length of the treatment and the utilization review entity shall not require the enrollee to obtain a prior authorization again for the health care service. 9.    A carrier shall accept and respond to prior authorization requests for medication coverage, under the pharmacy benefit part of a health benefits plan, made through a secure electronic transmission using the NCPDP SCRIPT Standard ePA (electronic prior authorization) transactions.  Facsimile, propriety payer portals, and electronic forms shall not be considered secure electronic transmission. 10.  A utilization review entity shall not: a.     require a health care provider offering services to a covered person to participate in a step therapy protocol if the provider deems that the step therapy protocol is not in the covered persons best interests; b.    require that a health care provider first obtain a waiver, exception, or other override when deeming a step therapy protocol to not be in a covered persons best interests; c.     sanction or otherwise penalize a health care provider for recommending or issuing a prescription, performing or recommending a procedure, or performing a test that may conflict with the step therapy protocol of the carrier; d.    require prior authorization for: (1)   generic medications that are not controlled substances; (2)   dosage changes of medications previously prescribed and authorized; or (3)   generic or brand name drugs after six months of adherence; or e.     deny medications on the grounds of therapeutic duplication. 11.  A utilization review entity shall not revoke, limit, condition or restrict a prior authorization if care is provided within 45 business days from the date the health care provider received the prior authorization.  Any language in a contract or a policy or any other attempt to disclaim payment for services that have been authorized within that 45 day period shall be null and void. 12.  A prior authorization shall be valid for purposes of authorizing the health care provider to provide care for a period of one year from the date the health care provider receives the prior authorization. 13.     a.

STATEMENT The bill places certain requirements regarding the use of prior authorization of health benefits on carriers and utilization review entities acting on behalf of carriers.  The bill defines carrier to include insurance companies, health, hospital, and medical service corporations, health maintenance organizations, and the State Health Benefits Program and School Employees Health Benefits Program. The bill also adds a definition of enrollee and medications for opioid use disorder and adds mental health services and behavioral health services to the definition of urgent health care service. The bill requires a utilization review entity to make certain disclosures regarding its prior authorization requirements and restrictions, on its website and in writing, including certain statistics concerning approvals and denials, as set forth in the bill.  This includes data on whether prior authorization determinations were appealed, approved or denied on appeal, and the time between submission of prior authorization requests and the determination. The bill also requires that a utilization review entity ensure that a physician make any adverse determination and specifies the qualifications the physician is to meet to make the determination. Additionally, questions over the medical necessity of a health care service are to be conveyed from the utilization review entity to the physician of the enrollee who is to receive the health care service and that physician is granted the opportunity to discuss the service with the physician who will determine its authorization for the review entity.  The utilization review entity is to also ensure that a physician who is to review an appeal of an adverse determination meets certain requirements delineated in the bill. The bill provides that if a utilization review entity requires prior authorization of a covered service, the utilization review entity shall make a prior authorization or adverse determination and notify the subscriber (also commonly known as a policyholder) and the subscribers health care provider of the prior authorization or adverse determination within one calendar day of obtaining all necessary information to make the prior authorization or adverse determination. Necessary information is considered received if it is transmitted to the utilization review entity after being sent by electronic portal, e-mail, facsimile, telephone or other means of communication. The bill provides that a utilization review entity is to render a prior authorization or adverse determination concerning an urgent health care service, and notify the subscriber and the subscribers health care provider of that prior authorization or adverse determination, not later than 24 hours after receiving all information needed to complete the review of the requested service. The bill further adds that medications for opioid use disorder do not require prior authorization. The bill requires a utilization review entity to adhere to certain practices with respect to authorization of emergency health care services, establishes a presumption that these services are medically necessary in some situations, and deems certain services to be approved under certain circumstances. The bill also prohibits a utilization review entity from: · Requiring a health care provider offering services to a covered person to participate in a step therapy protocol if the provider deems that the step therapy protocol is not in the covered persons best interests; · Requiring that a health care provider first obtain a waiver, exception, or other override when deeming a step therapy protocol to not be in a covered persons best interests; or · Sanctioning or otherwise penalizing a health care provider for recommending or issuing a prescription, performing or recommending a procedure, or performing a test that may conflict with the step therapy protocol of the carrier. Additionally, the bill establishes requirements regarding the prior authorization of certain medications. The bill further provides that a utilization review entity is not to revoke, limit, condition, or restrict a prior authorization if care is provided within 45 business days from the date the health care provider received the prior authorization.  A prior authorization is to be valid for purposes of authorizing the health care provider to provide care for a period of one year from the date the health care provider receives the prior authorization.  The bill also includes a provision authorizing a utilization review entity to honor a previous prior authorization for the initial 60 days of coverage under a new health plan of an enrollee, grant the entity the right to review the prior authorization during the initial 60 days, and prohibit any change in coverage or approval criteria for prior authorization from impacting an enrollees access to the service authorized previously if the service was authorized before the effective date of the change for the remainder of the enrollees plan year. Any failure by a utilization review entity to comply with a deadline or other requirement under the provisions of the bill is to result in any health care services subject to review being automatically deemed authorized. Finally, the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance is to promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), including any penalties or enforcement provisions, that the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the bill.
