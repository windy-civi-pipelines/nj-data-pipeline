<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known
and may be cited as the Ensuring Transparency in Prior Authorization Act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     the physician-patient
relationship is paramount and should not be subject to third party intrusion; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    prior authorization
programs can place attempted cost savings ahead of optimal patient care; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     prior authorization
programs shall not be permitted to hinder patient care or intrude on the
practice of medicine; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    prior authorization
programs must include the use of written clinical criteria and reviews by
appropriate physicians to ensure a fair process for patients. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in this act: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Adverse determination means
a decision by a utilization review entity that the covered services furnished
or proposed to be furnished to a subscriber are not medically necessary, or are
experimental or investigational; and benefit coverage is therefore denied,
reduced, or terminated.  A decision to deny, reduce, or terminate services
which are not covered for reasons other than their medical necessity or experimental
or investigational nature is not an adverse determination for purposes of
this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Authorization means a
determination by a utilization review entity that a covered service has been
reviewed and, based on the information provided, satisfies the utilization
review entitys requirements for medical necessity and appropriateness and that
payment will be made for that health care service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Carrier means an insurance
company, health service corporation, hospital service corporation, medical
service corporation, or health maintenance organization authorized to issue
health benefits plans in this State, and shall include the State Health
Benefits Program and the School Employees Health Benefits Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Clinical criteria means the
written policies, written screening procedures, drug formularies or lists of
covered drugs, determination rules, determination abstracts, clinical
protocols, practice guidelines, medical protocols and any other criteria or
rationale used by the utilization review entity to determine the necessity and
appropriateness of covered services. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Covered person means a
person on whose behalf a carrier offering the health benefits plan is obligated
to pay benefits or provide services pursuant to the plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Covered service means a
health care service provided to a covered person under a health benefits plan
for which the carrier is obligated to pay benefits or provide services, and
shall include health care service and emergency health care services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Emergency health care
services means those covered services that are provided in an emergency health
care facility after the sudden onset of a medical condition that manifests itself
by symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, that the absence of
immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected by a prudent
layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, to result
in: (1) placing a covered persons health in serious jeopardy; (2) serious
impairment to bodily function; or (3) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ
or part.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Enrollee means a covered
person or subscriber. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Health benefits plan means a
benefits plan which pays or provides hospital and medical expense benefits for
covered services, and is delivered or issued for delivery in this State by or
through a carrier.  Health benefits plan includes, but is not limited to,
Medicare supplement coverage and risk contracts to the extent not otherwise
prohibited by federal law.  For the purposes of this act, health benefits plan
shall not include the following plans, policies, or contracts:  accident only,
credit, disability, long-term care, TRICARE supplement coverage, coverage arising
out of a workers' compensation or similar law, automobile medical payment
insurance, personal injury protection insurance issued pursuant to P.L.1972,
c.70 (C.39:6A-1 et seq.), or hospital confinement indemnity coverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Health care provider means an
individual or entity which, acting within the scope of its licensure or
certification, provides a covered service defined by the health benefits plan. 
Health care provider includes, but is not limited to, a physician and other
health care professionals licensed pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised
Statutes, and a hospital and other health care facilities licensed pursuant to
Title 26 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Health care service means
