authority of any municipality shall appoint an enforcing agency and
construction board of appeals pursuant to section 8 of P.L.1975, c.217
(C.52:27D-126), the municipal governing body by ordinance, in accordance with
standards established by the commissioner, shall set enforcing agency fees for
plan review, construction permit, <u>inspection,</u> certificate of occupancy,
demolition permit, moving of building permit, elevator permit<u>,</u> and sign
permit, provided, however, that such fees shall not exceed the annual costs for
the operation of the enforcing agency.  For the three-year period commencing

Processing Review System,&quot; developed and implemented pursuant to section 1
of P.L.2021, c.70 (C.52:27D-124.4), the municipal governing body may impose,
and the enforcing agency may collect, construction permit surcharge fees to
defray the enforcing agency's startup costs related to offering electronic plan
review and scheduling.  Surcharge fees shall be established in accordance with
standards established by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 14 of P.L.1975,
c.217 (C.52:27D-132) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     14. a. The enforcing agency
shall periodically inspect all construction undertaken pursuant to a
construction permit issued by it to ensure that the construction or alteration
is performed in accordance with the conditions of the construction permit and
consistent with the requirements of the code and any ordinance implementing
said code.</p>

premises upon which a building or structure is being constructed shall be
deemed to have consented to the inspection by the enforcing agency and the
department, of the entire premises and of any and all construction being
performed on it until a certificate of occupancy has been issued.  An
inspector, or team of inspectors, on presentation of proper credentials, shall
have the right to enter and inspect such premises, and any and all construction
thereon, for purposes of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the
applicable construction permit, the code, and other applicable laws and
regulations.  All <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>inspection<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>inspections</u>
pursuant to P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.) shall be between the hours
of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on business days or at another time that has been agreed
upon by the owner and the relevant inspecting entity, whether the enforcing
agency, department, or private on-site inspection agency, or when construction
is actually being undertaken, provided, however, that inspections may be
conducted at other times if the enforcing agency has reasonable cause to
believe that an immediate danger to life, limb or property exists, or if
permission is given by an owner, or the owner's agent, architect, engineer or
builder.  No person shall accompany an inspector or team of inspectors on any
inspection pursuant to P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), unless the
person's presence is necessary for the enforcement of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119
et seq.), or the code, or unless consent is given by an owner or the owner's
agent, architect, engineer or builder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If the construction of
a structure or building is being undertaken contrary to the provisions of a
construction permit, P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), the code, or other
applicable laws or ordinances, the enforcing agency may issue a stop
construction order in writing which shall state the conditions upon which
construction may be resumed and which shall be given to the owner or the holder
of the construction permit or to the person performing the construction.  If
the person doing the construction is not known, or cannot be located with
reasonable effort, the notice may be delivered to the person in charge of, or
apparently in charge of, the construction.  No person shall continue, or cause
or allow to be continued, the construction of a building or structure in
violation of a stop construction order, except with the permission of the
enforcing agency to abate a dangerous condition or remove a violation, or
except by court order.  If an order to stop construction is not obeyed, the
enforcing agency may apply to the appropriate court as otherwise established by
law for an order enjoining the violation of the stop construction order.  The
remedy for violation of such an order provided in this subsection shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedies provided by law or
ordinance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    When an inspector or
team of inspectors finds a violation of the provisions of a construction
permit, the code, or other applicable laws and regulations at an owner-occupied
single-family residence, and issues a notice of violation and an order to
terminate the violation, the enforcing agency shall require the same inspector
or team of inspectors who found the violation to undertake any subsequent
reinspection thereof at the premises.  When the same inspector or team of
inspectors cannot be assigned to undertake the reinspection, the enforcing
agency may assign an available inspector provided the scope of the reinspection
shall be limited to the violation for which the reinspection is required.  The
requirements of this subsection shall not apply to violations of the plumbing
or electrical subcodes, or to fire safety code violations, or to any violation
of any other subcode that the Department of Community Affairs determines to be
a health or safety violation.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to
infringe upon the right of a property owner to request a different inspector,
team of inspectors, or supervisor, to perform any required reinspection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The owner, agent, or
other responsible person in charge of work shall notify the enforcing agency
when the work is ready for any required inspection under the code.  This notice
shall be given in writing at least 24 hours prior to the date and time
