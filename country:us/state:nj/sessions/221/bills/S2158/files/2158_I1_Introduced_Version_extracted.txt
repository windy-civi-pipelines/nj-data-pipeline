The bill also requires the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission to establish a public awareness campaign to inform the general public about the dangers of underrides and best practices to prevent underrides. An underride protection system is designed to withstand the force of a crash to prevent a vehicle from sliding under a tractor trailer or other large bus or truck.  From 1994 to 2015, there were 4,195 fatalities due to crashes involving underrides in the United States.  The bill is intended to help decrease the risk of fatalities in crashes involving tractor trailers and other large buses and trucks.
