S3029 SENATE, No. 3029 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED APRIL 8, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  SHIRLEY K. TURNER District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS Provides comparable salary increases and performance advancement adjustments for certain State employees assigned to titles with no range or rate. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning salary and other benefits for certain State employees and supplementing Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, State employees in the Executive Branch assigned to titles having no salary range or rate shall receive an increase in salary comparable to, but not to exceed, the percentage of the mean general salary increases provided to State employees in the States Aligned Employee Relations Groups.  Performance advancement adjustments due to any State employee assigned to a title having no salary range or rate shall not be withheld unless the employee has received a formal written performance evaluation rating of unsatisfactory or its equivalent. 2.    This act shall take effect July 1, 2024. STATEMENT This bill provides comparable salary increases and performance advancement adjustments for State employees assigned to titles with no range or rate. Currently, State employees can be separated into two broad categories of employees: employees in titles with salary ranges and employees in no-range titles.  Employees in no-range titles do not receive scheduled salary increases, or step increases, as employees with salary ranges do.  Instead, these employees often wait multiple years for their salaries to be increased.  Approximately 13,000 of the approximately 71,000 State employees in New Jersey are in no-range titles and do not receive step increases. This bill provides that State employees in the Executive Branch assigned to titles having no salary range or rate would receive an increase in salary comparable to, but not to exceed, the percentage of the mean general salary increases provided to State employees in the States Aligned Employee Relations Groups (ERGs).  There are currently 50 ERGs in the State. This bill also provides that performance advancement adjustments due to any State employee assigned to a title having no salary range or rate would not be withheld unless the employee has received a formal written performance evaluation rating of unsatisfactory or its equivalent.
