<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 3 of P.L.1977,
c.85 (C.34:13A-16) is amended to read as follows:    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a. (1) Negotiations
between a public fire or police department and an exclusive representative
concerning the terms and conditions of employment shall begin at least 120 days
prior to the day on which their collective negotiation agreement is to expire. 
The parties shall meet at least three times during that 120-day period.  The
first of those three meetings shall take place no later than the 90th day prior
to the day on which their collective negotiation agreement is to expire.  By
mutual consent, the parties may agree to extend the period during which the
second and third meetings are required to take place beyond the day on which
their collective negotiation agreement is to expire.  A violation of this
paragraph shall constitute an unfair practice and the violator shall be subject
to the penalties prescribed by the commission pursuant to rule and regulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Prior to the expiration of
their collective negotiation agreement, either party may file an unfair
practice charge with the commission alleging that the other party is refusing
to negotiate in good faith.  The charge shall be filed in the manner, form and
time specified by the commission in rule and regulation.  If the charge is
sustained, the commission shall order that the respondent be assessed for all
legal and administrative costs associated with the filing and resolution of the
charge; if the charge is dismissed, the commission shall order that the
charging party be assessed for all legal and administrative costs associated
with the filing and resolution of the charge.  The filing and resolution of the
unfair practice charge shall not delay or impair the impasse resolution
process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Whenever those
negotiations concerning the terms and conditions of employment shall reach an
impasse, the commission, through the Division of Public Employment Relations
shall, upon the request of either party, or upon its own motion take such
steps, including the assignment of a mediator, as it may deem expedient to
effect a voluntary resolution of the impasse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1) In the event of a
failure to resolve the impasse by mediation, the Division of Public Employment
Relations, at the request of either party, shall invoke factfinding with
recommendation for settlement of all issues in dispute unless the parties reach
a voluntary settlement prior to the issuance of the factfinder's report and
recommended terms of settlement. Factfinding shall be limited to those issues
that are within the required scope of negotiations unless the parties to the
factfinding agree to factfinding on permissive subjects of negotiation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Notwithstanding the
provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section or paragraph (1)
of this subsection, either party may petition the commission for arbitration on
or after the date on which their collective negotiation agreement expires.  The
petition shall be filed in a manner and form prescribed by the commission.  The
party filing the petition shall notify the other party of its action. The
notice shall be given in a manner and form prescribed by the commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any mediation or factfinding
invoked pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section or paragraph
(1) of subsection b. of this section shall terminate immediately upon the
filing of a petition for arbitration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Upon the filing of a
petition for arbitration pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, an

mutual selection on the fourth business day, the bill requires the commission to
randomly select an arbitrator without participation of either party. The bill
also removes the requirement that arbitrators serving on the panel are required
to demonstrate to the commission their professional qualification, knowledge
and experience, in accordance with the criteria and rules adopted by the
commission.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also extends the time
frame during which an arbitrator is required to render an opinion to 150 days
of the commissions assignment.  Current law requires an arbitrator or panel of
arbitrators to render an opinion with 90 days of the commissions assignment. 
Under the bill, an arbitrator may request an extension and the commission chair
or a designee may grant the extension if warranted.  The bill limits the
extension time to 30 days cumulatively but in no case more than 180 days.  The
bill also extends from 14 days to 21 days the amount of time that an aggrieved
party may file an appeal under certain circumstances.  Under the bill, the
parties would be required to meet within 10 days after the issuance of an award
to complete the awards implementation and resolve any issued to avoid filing
of an appeal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also increases the
fees associated with the cost of arbitration that are equally shared by the
parties.  Specifically the bill increases the cost of services provided by the
arbitrator from $1,000 to $1,500 per day.  The total cost of services of an
arbitrator would be increased from $10,000 to $15,000.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill repeals
sections from current law that place a limitation on the amount that may be
awarded during an arbitration proceeding and establish an Police and Fire
Interest Arbitration Impact Task Force.             <span style='letter-spacing:
