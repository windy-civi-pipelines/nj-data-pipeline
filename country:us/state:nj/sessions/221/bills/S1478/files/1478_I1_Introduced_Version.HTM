program that provides job training and educational opportunities for at-risk

would expand YouthBuild programs in the State by establishing a State program

serving economically disadvantaged young people ages 16 to 24 who have not

education and job skills training services and activities which are evenly
divided within the program, with 50 percent of students time spent in
classroom-based instruction, counseling, and leadership development instruction
and 50 percent of their time spent in service learning experiences at job

years, the YouthBuild model, through YouthBuild USA, has demonstrated positive
outcomes for youth-supporting young people in earning their high school
diploma, or equivalent, and acquiring the skills and credentials necessary to
meet their postsecondary goals.  Over the years, the number of YouthBuild
programs throughout the State of New Jersey has fluctuated because the federal
YouthBuild appropriation from the federal Department of Labor is not
guaranteed.  A Statewide YouthBuild appropriation would help ensure that
opportunity youth throughout New Jersey are consistently served with an
evidence-based model.  It would promote the sustainability of currently
operating YouthBuild programs and would also likely lead to an increase in
YouthBuild programs throughout New Jersey.</span></p>
