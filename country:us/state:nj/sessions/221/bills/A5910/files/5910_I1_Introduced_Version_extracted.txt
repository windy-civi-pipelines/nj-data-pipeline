STATEMENT This bill would modify the definition of Class I renewable energy in the Energy Discount and Energy Competition Act, P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), to include energy produced through nuclear fission.  The bill would also provide a Corporation Business Tax (CBT) tax credit for the production of clean baseload energy. The bill defines clean baseload energy as any form of electric energy production which is able to reliably produce energy continuously and at a constant rate, without emitting greenhouse gases as a byproduct, including nuclear fission.  The amount of the tax credit would be set at $1,000 per gigawatt hour of clean baseload energy produced. The intent of this bill is to support existing nuclear power stations in the State and to incentivize the new generation assets using nuclear fission by recognizing fission as a clean Class I renewable energy source and by incentivizing production through a targeted tax credit.  Nuclear power has the potential to be a transformational technology for the State, as it is the only currently viable form of electricity production that is able to reliably produce power, at scale, without greenhouse gas emissions.

telemarketing sales call.  A telephone call made in response to an express written request of a customer shall not be deemed a telemarketing sales call. Thermal efficiency means the useful electric energy output of a facility, plus the useful thermal energy output of the facility, expressed as a percentage of the total energy input to the facility. Transition bond charge means a charge, expressed as an amount per kilowatt hour, that is authorized by and imposed on electric public utility ratepayers pursuant to a bondable stranded costs rate order, as modified at any time pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.). Transition bonds means bonds, notes, certificates of participation, beneficial interest, or other evidences of indebtedness or ownership issued pursuant to an indenture, contract, or other agreement of an electric public utility or a financing entity, the proceeds of which are used, directly or indirectly, to recover, finance or refinance bondable stranded costs and which are, directly or indirectly, secured by or payable from bondable transition property. References in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) to principal, interest, and acquisition or redemption premium with respect to transition bonds which are issued in the form of certificates of participation or beneficial interest or other evidences of ownership shall refer to the comparable payments on such securities. Transition period means the period from August 1, 1999 through July 31, 2003. Transmission and distribution system means, with respect to an electric public utility, any facility or equipment that is used for the transmission, distribution, or delivery of electricity to the customers of the electric public utility including, but not limited to, the land, structures, meters, lines, switches, and all other appurtenances thereof and thereto, owned or controlled by the electric public utility within this State. Universal service means any service approved by the board with the purpose of assisting low-income residential customers in obtaining or retaining electric generation or delivery service. Unsolicited advertisement means any advertising claims of the commercial availability or quality of services provided by an electric power supplier, gas supplier, broker, energy agent, marketer, private aggregator, sales representative, or telemarketer which is transmitted to a potential customer without that customers prior express invitation or permission. (cf: P.L.2021, c.169, s.9) 2.  (New section) a.  As used in this section: Board means the Board of Public Utilities. Clean baseload energy means any form of electric energy production which is able to reliably produce energy continuously and at a constant rate, without emitting greenhouse gases as a direct byproduct of generation.  Clean baseload energy includes, but is not limited to, nuclear fission. Director means Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury. b.  A taxpayer that is the owner or operator of a facility that produces clean baseload energy shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), in an amount equal to $1,000 for each gigawatt hour of clean baseload energy produced by the taxpayer, provided that the expenditures are certified by the board pursuant to this section. c.  (1)  To qualify for the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section, the taxpayer shall file an application for a certification from the board.  The board may require the submission of any additional information the board deems necessary to make a certification, including, but not limited to, generation data and facility permit information.  The certification shall specify the amount of clean baseload energy produced by the taxpayer and the amount of the credit available to the taxpayer. (2) The board shall have 90 days from the date of receipt of a complete application to make a determination as to the issuance of a certification. (3) Upon certification, the board shall submit a copy thereof to the taxpayer and the director.  In filing a tax return that includes a claim for the credit allowed pursuant to this section, the taxpayer shall include a copy of the certification. d.  The first privilege period in which a taxpayer may use a credit allowed under this section is the privilege period for which the taxpayers application made and filed for a certification from the board is granted. e.  The amount of any unused credit may be carried forward, if necessary, for use in each of the seven privilege periods following the privilege period for which the credit is allowed. f.  The order of priority of the application of the credit allowed pursuant to this section and any other credits allowed by law shall be as prescribed by the director.  The amount of the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period, together with any other credits allowed against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax liability otherwise due and shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). g.  A credit shall not be allowed pursuant to this section for the production of clean baseload energy which is included in the calculation of any other credit allowed against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). h.  The Department of the Treasury may adopt, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations as necessary to implement the provisions of this section. 3.  Section 1 of this act shall take effect immediately.  Section 2 of this act shall take effect immediately and apply to tax years beginning on and after January 1 next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill would modify the definition of Class I renewable energy in the Energy Discount and Energy Competition Act, P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), to include energy produced through nuclear fission.  The bill would also provide a Corporation Business Tax (CBT) tax credit for the production of clean baseload energy. The bill defines clean baseload energy as any form of electric energy production which is able to reliably produce energy continuously and at a constant rate, without emitting greenhouse gases as a byproduct, including nuclear fission.  The amount of the tax credit would be set at $1,000 per gigawatt hour of clean baseload energy produced. The intent of this bill is to support existing nuclear power stations in the State and to incentivize the new generation assets using nuclear fission by recognizing fission as a clean Class I renewable energy source and by incentivizing production through a targeted tax credit.  Nuclear power has the potential to be a transformational technology for the State, as it is the only currently viable form of electricity production that is able to reliably produce power, at scale, without greenhouse gas emissions.
