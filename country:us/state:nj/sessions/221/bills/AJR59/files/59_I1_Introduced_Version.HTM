Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death associated with diabetes and accounts for 68 percent of deaths in people with type 2 diabetes.  People with type 2 diabetes also have a much higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the first place.  Yet findings from a recent study reveal that 52 percent of adults living with type 2 diabetes are unaware of this increased risk. There are significant costs associated with the treatment of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and Medicare expenditures for this population in the State total nearly $1.5 billion for 5,481 beneficiaries.  By increasing public awareness and providing education about the cardiovascular risks associated with diabetes, the State can improve the overall outcome of, and reduce the financial burdens associated with, the illness.
