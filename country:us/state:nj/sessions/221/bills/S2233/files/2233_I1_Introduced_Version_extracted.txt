For purposes of this section, "victim-centered response" means a systematic focus on the needs and concerns of a victim of sexual assault that: ensures the compassionate and sensitive delivery of services in a nonjudgmental manner; ensures an understanding of how trauma affects victim behavior; maintains victim safety, privacy and, where possible, confidentiality; and recognizes that a victim is not responsible for the sexual assault. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall first apply to the 2022-2023 academic year. STATEMENT This bill requires each institution of higher education to annually provide victim-centered training to an employee of the institution who is involved in the receipt of a report made by a student who is the victim of an alleged incident of sexual assault, the referral or provision of services to the victim, or any campus disciplinary proceedings that result from the alleged incident.  The training must also be provided to a student enrolled in the institution who is appointed to serve as a residence-life advisor, peer advisor, or in a similar position, and an employee or contracted service provider that provides campus security.  The training must include information that ensures that the student receives an appropriate victim-centered response upon reporting an incident of sexual assault. Specifically, the training must seek to improve the ability of the trainee to: · understand the sexual assault policies of the institution; · understand the relevant provisions of certain State and federal laws; · understand the role of the institution, medical providers, law enforcement, and community agencies in ensuring a coordinated response to a reported incident of sexual assault; · provide services to, or assist in locating services for, the victim, as appropriate; and · communicate sensitively and compassionately with the victim of a sexual assault.
