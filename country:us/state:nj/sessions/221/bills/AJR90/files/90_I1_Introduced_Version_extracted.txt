Whereas, United States military service members serve this country with honor and dignity; and Whereas, They leave their families, friends and jobs and put their lives at risk for this country; and Whereas, Some return home and are able to go back to their former work, while others find that they no longer have a job and are unemployed; and Whereas, While service members are on active duty, civil service examinations are given but the service members are not permitted to participate due to their deployment; and Whereas, The New Jersey Civil Service Commission (CSC) currently offers computer based testing for management and supervisory level positions in proctored environments with several candidates being tested at one time in multiple locations; and Whereas, The United States Department of Defense (DOD) should coordinate with the CSC so that each branch of the military and commanding officers could proctor civil service examinations; and Whereas, A coordinated effort by the CSC and the DOD providing the ability to participate in civil service examinations during deployment would result in service members being in the civil service system when an employment eligibility list is requested by a public employer seeking to hire, increasing their chances of finding employment; and Whereas, It is in the best interest of our military service members who put their lives at risk and make so many sacrifices, to have every opportunity to find employment after their service; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The State of New Jersey urges the United States Department of Defense to work in partnership with the New Jersey Civil Service Commission to allow deployed military service members to take civil service examinations while deployed. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to each member of Congress elected from this State, to the Secretary of the United States Department of Defense, the Adjutant General of the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, and the chair of the New Jersey Civil Service Commission. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution urges the United States Department of Defense and the New Jersey Civil Service Commission to work together to permit deployed military service members to take civil service examinations while deployed.  The ability to participate in civil service examinations during deployment would result in service members being in the civil service system when an employment eligibility list is requested by a public employer seeking to hire, increasing their chances of finding employment after their service.  Service members would still need to provide proof of veteran status no later than eight days prior to the issuance of an employment list to receive a hiring preference.
