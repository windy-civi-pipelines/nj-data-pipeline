SCR111 SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION No. 111 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 24, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  JOSEPH PENNACCHIO District 26 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Expresses support for Equal Representation Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Concurrent Resolution expressing support for the Equal Representation Act. Whereas, H.R. 7109, known as the Equal Representation Act, was introduced on January 29, 2024 to require a citizenship question on the decennial census, to require reporting on certain census statistics, and to modify the apportionment of United States Representatives to be based on the United States citizen population instead of being based on all individuals who are physically present in the United States, which includes those who are in this country illegally; and Whereas, Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution requires that a census be conducted every 10 years; and Whereas, The census has a profound influence on the nation, as the results are used to apportion seats in the United States House of Representatives, determine each states electoral votes allocated for a presidential election, and redraw state legislative and congressional districts; and Whereas, The census figures are based on actual counts of all persons living in the United States, including citizens, noncitizen legal residents, noncitizen long-term visitors, and illegal immigrants; and Whereas, Due to the inclusion of noncitizens in the census counts, congressional districts with low numbers of noncitizens suffer politically in comparison to districts with high numbers of noncitizens; and Whereas, Current estimates suggest that, under the leadership of President Biden, over 10 million people have illegally entered the United States; and Whereas, The number of illegal immigrants continues to overwhelm U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the municipal services of border towns, illicit drugs like fentanyl continue to pour over the border, and the Biden administration willfully turns a blind eye to human trafficking and the safety of unaccompanied children; and Whereas, At a hearing held on January 17, 2024 by the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, immigration policy and law enforcement experts testified how the unilateral decisions by the Biden administration are fueling unprecedented illegal immigration and jeopardizing border security; and Whereas, According to current estimates, the more than 10 million people who have entered the country illegally under President Biden have increased the population of illegal immigrants in the United States to more than 20 million people; and Whereas, The total noncitizen population in the United States, including illegal immigrants, noncitizen legal residents, and noncitizen long-term visitors, is estimated to be as high as 30 million people; and Whereas, The United States noncitizen population is so large that, if the countrys noncitizens were all located in one state, that state would surpass Texas as the second most populated state in the country and would be apportioned the equivalent of 40 congressional districts and 42 electoral votes in presidential elections; and Whereas, On May 8, 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed the Equal Representation Act, H.R. 7109, which would ensure that congressional representation and, in turn, electoral college votes, would be apportioned based on the United States citizen population and would not be diluted by the countrys noncitizen population; and Whereas, The United States Senate has not yet taken a vote on the Equal Representation Act; and Whereas, It is imperative that the right of each American citizen to receive equal representation in government be protected from dilution; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey (the General Assembly concurring): 1.  The Legislature expresses support for H.R. 7109, known as the Equal Representation Act, which requires a citizenship question on the decennial census, requires reporting on certain census statistics, and modifies the apportionment of United States Representatives, as well as electoral college votes, to be based on the population of United States citizens instead of all individuals. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the Majority and Minority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and to every member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution expresses support for H.R. 7109, known as the Equal Representation Act, which requires a citizenship question on the decennial census, requires reporting on certain census statistics, and modifies the apportionment of United States Representatives, as well as electoral college votes, to be based on the population of United States citizens instead of being based on all individuals who are physically present in the United States, which includes those who are in this country illegally. The United States Constitution requires that a census be conducted every 10 years, with the results impacting the apportionment of seats in the United States House of Representatives, the determination of electoral votes allocated for a presidential election for each state, and the redrawing of state legislative and congressional districts.  Census figures are currently based on actual counts of all persons living in the United States, including citizens, noncitizen legal residents, noncitizen long-term visitors, and illegal immigrants. Current estimates suggest that, under the leadership of President Biden, over 10 million people have illegally entered the United States, which continues to overwhelm U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the municipal services of border towns and continues to allow illicit drugs like fentanyl to pour over the border.  The Biden administration willfully turns a blind eye to human trafficking and the safety of unaccompanied children.  On January 17, 2024, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability heard testimony from immigration policy and law enforcement experts on how the unilateral decisions by the Biden administration are fueling unprecedented illegal immigration and jeopardizing border security. The more than 10 million people who are estimated to have entered the country illegally under President Biden have increased the population of illegal immigrants in the United States to more than 20 million people.  The total noncitizen population in the United States, including illegal immigrants, noncitizen legal residents, and noncitizen long-term visitors, is estimated to be as high as 30 million people.  The United States noncitizen population is so large that, if the countrys noncitizens were all located in one state, that state would surpass Texas as the second most populated state in the country and would be apportioned the equivalent of 40 congressional districts and 42 electoral votes in presidential elections. The United States House of Representatives introduced H.R. 7109, known as the Equal Representation Act, on January 29, 2024 and passed the bill on May 8, 2024.  Although the United States Senate has not yet voted on the Equal Representation Act, passage of the bill would ensure that congressional representation would be apportioned based on the United States citizen population and would not be diluted by the countrys noncitizen population.  It is imperative that the right of each American citizen to receive equal representation in government be protected from dilution and passage of the Equal Representation Act would provide such protection.
