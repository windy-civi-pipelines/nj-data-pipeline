The bill authorizes the department to utilize any combination of available funding from various sources to provide grants under the program.  In awarding grants under the program, the department will expend any available forms of non-State financial assistance before expending State funds.  The bill appropriates from the General Fund to the Department of Agriculture such sums as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of the bill. In 2022, food banks in New Jersey distributed over 125 million pounds of food and provided over 100 million meals through various feeding agencies, including soup kitchens, food pantries, and shelters.  Each year the New Jersey Food Distribution Program provides more than 40 million pounds of United States Department of Agriculture-donated food commodities to over 1,000 recipient agencies and feeding programs.  It is the sponsors belief that ensuring the proper storage and preservation of food throughout the food recovery supply chain will result in the distribution of fresher and more nutritious food to people in this State who are food insecure.
