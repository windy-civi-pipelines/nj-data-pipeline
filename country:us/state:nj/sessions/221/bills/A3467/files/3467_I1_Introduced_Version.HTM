<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   violated the
&quot;Common Interest Community and Homeowners' Association Act,&quot;
P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-1 et seq.), &quot;The Planned Real Estate Development
Full Disclosure Act,&quot; P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-21 et seq.), or any other
statute or regulation governing homeowners' associations hereinafter enacted;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   directly or through an
agent or employee, knowingly engaged in any violation of the governing
documents of the association; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   violated any lawful
order or rule of the department; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>then the department may issue an
order requiring the person to cease and desist from the unlawful practice or to
take such other affirmative action as in the judgment of the department will
carry out the purposes of P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   If the department makes
a finding of fact in writing that the public interest will be irreparably
harmed by delay in issuing an order, it may issue a temporary cease and desist
order.  Every temporary cease and desist order shall include in its terms a
provision that upon request a hearing shall be held within 10 days of such
request to determine whether it becomes permanent.  Such temporary cease and
desist order shall be forwarded by certified mail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The department shall
provide an opportunity for a hearing for any association of a common interest
community prior to the imposition of any sanction, including monetary fines. 
Associations shall be subject to fines only after they have failed or refused
to comply with an order of the department.  The maximum fine that may be levied
against an association for failure to comply with an order to cease and desist
from continuing to violate an order of the department shall be the greater of
$2,500 or one percent of the total annual expenditures as listed on the most
recently adopted budget, per order. The department may impose a monetary fine
on a board member or members, not to exceed $5,000, if it is determined that
the board member or members are solely responsible for the continued failure of
the board to comply with an order or orders issued pursuant to this section,
and the assessment of a fine against the association would be unfair under the
circumstances.  In such a case, the offending board member may not use the
association attorney, but may obtain private counsel at the members own
expense.  Appeal from a department determination pursuant to this section may
be made to the Office of Administrative Law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The penalties pursuant
to this section may be collected in a summary proceeding pursuant to the
&quot;Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999,&quot; P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et
seq.).  Jurisdiction to enforce such penalties is hereby conferred upon the
courts specified by section 2 of P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-11).  Suit may be
brought by the State of New Jersey; payment of a money judgment pursuant hereto
shall be remitted to the State Treasurer, for deposit into the trust fund;</p>

assist members of governing boards and officers of associations to carry out
their powers and duties consistent with the statutes, department rules, and the
common interest community governing documents; this activity shall be
coordinated with the Center for Government Services, Rutgers University and
shall include listings of appropriate reference and educational materials and
general budgetary and financial guidance. The ombudsman and the Center for

from any other assessment or association charges.  An association may file a
lien on a unit if the owner thereof refuses to pay the registration fee as
required by this section, and may also impose fines therefor and avail itself
of the procedure outlined in section b. of this section.  Associations formed
subsequent to the effective date of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

a judgment for a writ of attachment against the delinquent owner or owners. 
Upon a finding by the arbitrator that the outstanding assessments, charges, or
fines were properly imposed by an association upon the owner, and are duly
owed, and the delinquency is not based on severe financial inability to pay,
such as illness or loss of employment, a lien may be recorded on the defaulting
owners' unit if not previously filed, and the arbitrator may apply, upon the

appropriate governmental officials any information that may indicate violation
of any statute, criminal or otherwise, or any rules of court or professional

interest communities.  The advisory council would consist of nine members appointed

governmental entities and a nonpartisan voting rights group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill creates a new entity
within DCA, known as the Office of the Ombudsman for Common Interest Communities.
 This office would assist homeowners in understanding their rights and responsibilities
and the remedies available to them, as well as assist governing board members
and officers of associations in receiving appropriate training to allow them to
properly discharge their functions and duties.  Additionally, this office would
function as a liaison between associations and any entity concerning disputes
regarding code compliance or inspections.  The costs associated with the Office
of the Ombudsman for Common Interest Communities under the bill would be met by
a registration fee required to be paid annually by each unit owner assigned a
vote as a member of a common interest community.  The fee is not subject to
being increased by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, 90 days after
enactment all homeowners associations are required to register with DCA, and
pay an annual registration fee.  The fee would not exceed three dollars for
each unit to which a vote as a member of the association is allocated within
the common interest community.  This fee would not be adjusted annually by the
commissioner.  Associations would collect the fee on a per voting unit basis
and report the fee paid in their financial documents separate from any other
assessment or association charges.  All registration fees and penalty moneys
received by DCA would be deposited in an interest bearing, non lapsing
revolving fund, entitled the &quot;Common Interest Community Homeowners'
Association Trust Fund,&quot; to be held by the State Treasurer.  Moneys held
in this non-lapsing revolving fund would be continuously appropriated to DCA
for the purposes of making grants to associations comprised, in part or in
whole, of low and moderate income households for assistance to those households
in the payment of the common maintenance expenses.  As well as, used by the
Center for Government Services, Rutgers University; for the purposes of
providing educational training or training materials for board members; the Center
for Negotiation and Conflict Resolution, Rutgers University for the purposes of
providing conflict resolution training for board members, property managers and
owners; the Association Regulation Unit in DCA for the purpose of providing
arbitration services and for training of volunteer mediators; and the purposes
of defraying administrative costs of the department for the booklet and
Advisory Council expenses, if any.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, DCA is
required to prepare and publish a booklet, which is to be made available at
cost to the general public, to associations and to unit owners in common
interest communities to serve as a general guide to community associations. 
The booklet would be distributed by the association to each unit owner free of
charge initially, and at cost as required for distribution to purchasers; it
will be the duty of each selling unit owner to provide a copy of the booklet to
a purchaser of the unit at or before the time of signing of the sales contract.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, funding for
grants and loans to homeowner associations maintaining common property in
inclusionary common interest communities containing units reserved for low and moderate
income families, would be supported by a set-aside of a portion of the
registration fees now charged developers of such communities.</p>
