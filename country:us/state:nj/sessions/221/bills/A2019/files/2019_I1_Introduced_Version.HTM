<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning motor vehicle stops and supplementing and
amending various parts of the statutory law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a. Issuing citations for
certain motor vehicle violations by mail, also referred to as contactless
policing, would be beneficial to the community and law enforcement officers; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Contactless policing
would allow law enforcement officers to police crime and not people.  It would
also result in the elimination of millions of motor vehicle stops each year; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     As the average police
stop takes up to 15 minutes, this would free up a law enforcement officers
time to police crime and engage in community policing; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Community policing
creates opportunities for interaction between community members and law
enforcement officers, not only in the context of an officer responding to a
crime.  This results in more interaction in general, but more importantly, more
positive interaction; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     When analyzing data of
motor vehicle stops, multiple studies have found support for the veil of
darkness theory: as the sun sets and it becomes more difficult to determine
the race of the driver, the percentage of black drivers stopped by law
enforcement officers for motor vehicle violations decreases significantly, with
a 10 to 15 percent decrease in many jurisdictions.  Often, these motor vehicle
stops of black drivers are pretextual, with a driver being detained for a minor
infraction while law enforcement seek evidence of a more serious crime;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Under this act, a law
enforcement officer would be able to issue a citation for certain motor vehicle
violations by mail without initiating an interaction with the driver; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The intent of this act
is to reduce the loss of all lives at the hands of law enforcement officers by
using technology to reduce pretextual stops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  (New section)
Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary and except as
provided in subsections d. and e. of this section, a State, county, or
municipal law enforcement officer shall not initiate a motor vehicle stop
solely for a violation of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes.  A law enforcement
officer may issue a citation for a violation of Title 39 of the Revised
Statutes observed by the law enforcement officer by first class mail to the
registered owner of the motor vehicle on a form prescribed by the
Administrative Director of the Courts.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Any photographs or video
from a law enforcement officers mobile video recording system depicting the
alleged violation shall be made available to the registered owner of the motor
vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If a law enforcement
officer issues a citation, the citation shall be issued and sent by the law
enforcement agency to the registered owner of the motor vehicle within seven
days from the date on which the alleged violation occurred.  Photographs of the
alleged violation and information regarding how to access video of the alleged
violation pursuant to subsection b. of this section also shall be sent with the
citation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection a. of this section, every State, county, and municipal
law enforcement officer may initiate a motor vehicle stop, rather than issuing
a citation by mail, for the following violations observed by the law
enforcement officer:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Racing on Highway,
R.S.39:4-52; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Passing to Left When
Overtaking, Passing When in Lines, Passing on Right, R.S.39:4-85; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Overtaking and Passing
Vehicles, Crossing No Passing Lines, R.S.39:4-86;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Following, Space Between
Trucks, R.S.39:4-89; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Reckless Driving,
R.S.39:4-96; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Use of Wireless Telephone,
Electronic Communication Device in Moving Vehicles, section 1 of P.L.2003.
c.310 <br>
(C.39:4-97.3); </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Rates of Speed,
R.S.39:4-98 when the driver exceeds the posted speed limit by 30 miles per hour
or more;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   Action in Case of
Accident, R.S.39:4-129; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   Driving While

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill concerns motor
vehicle stops by law enforcement officers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, under the
provisions of this bill, a State, county, or municipal law enforcement officer
is prohibited from initiating a motor vehicle stop solely for a violation of
Title 39 of the Revised Statutes with exceptions for certain violations of
Title 39 of the Revised Statutes which pose a risk to public safety.  Instead,
the law enforcement officer may issue a citation for a violation of Title 39 of
the Revised Statutes observed by the law enforcement officer by first class
mail to the registered owner of the motor vehicle on form prescribed by the
Administrative Director of the Courts.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that any
photographs or video from a law enforcement officers mobile video recording
system depicting the alleged violation are to be made available to the registered
owner of the motor vehicle.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a citation is issued, the
citation is required to be issued and sent by the law enforcement agency to the
registered owner of the motor vehicle within seven days from the date on which
the alleged violation occurred.  In addition, photographs of the alleged
violation and information regarding how to access video of the alleged
violation also are required to be sent with the citation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, law
enforcement officers may initiate a motor vehicle stop for the following motor
vehicle violations: 1) racing on a highway; 2) improper passing on right or off
the roadway; 3) improper passing in a no passing zone; 4) tailgating; 5)
reckless driving; 6) use of a handheld cellphone or electronic communication
device while driving; 7) speeding when the driver exceeds the posted speed
limit by 30 miles per hour or more; 8) leaving the scene of an accident; and 9)
driving while intoxicated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill provides
that a law enforcement officer may initiate a motor vehicle stop following an
observed motor vehicle violation if: 1) there is a risk to public safety; 2)
there is an outstanding warrant for the arrest of the registered owner of the
motor vehicle or the law enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe
the driver of the motor vehicle has committed a crime; or 3) the motor vehicle
matches the description of a motor vehicle that a law enforcement officer has
reasonable cause to believe is involved in a kidnapping, human trafficking, or
any other crime for which failure to immediately apprehend the suspect is
reasonably likely to result in death or serious bodily injury to a person other
than the suspect.  The provisions of the bill define risk to public safety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, under the bill, there
is a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle which was
involved in a violation of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes was the person who
committed the violation, with the exception of certain offenses as provided in
the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that a
registered owner of a motor vehicle who receives a citation by mail under the
bills provisions, but was not the person who committed the violation is to be
permitted to contest it electronically or by remote access, rather than
requiring the owner to appear in court.  The Administrative Director of the
Courts is required to develop and implement a system that allows for this and
is required to adopt guidelines, which are to include the types of proof that
the registered owner of the motor vehicle may submit to the court to rebut the
presumption that the registered owner of the motor vehicle involved in the
violation was the person who committed the violation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, after initiating
a motor vehicle stop for a violation of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes, a
State, county, or municipal law enforcement officer is prohibited from asking
an operator or occupant of a motor vehicle for consent to search the motor
vehicle, the contents of the motor vehicle, or the person of the operator or occupant
unless the law enforcement officer has reasonable, articulable suspicion that
criminal behavior, other than a violation of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes,
was occurring or was about to occur.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
the odor of cannabis, either burned or raw, by itself, does not establish
probable cause for a State, county, or municipal law enforcement officer to
search a motor vehicle or the operator or occupants of a motor vehicle.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, after
initiating a motor vehicle stop, a State, county, or municipal law enforcement
officer is not to use a drug-detection canine, unless the law enforcement
officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that there is a controlled
dangerous substance or controlled substance analog, other than marijuana or
cannabis, in the motor vehicle or on the person of the operator or occupant of
the motor vehicle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the Office
of Law Enforcement Professional Standards is required to prepare semi-annual
reports on State Police traffic enforcement activities and procedures.  This
bill requires the reports to also include aggregate statistics on the number of
citations issued by mail by the State Police for a violation of Title 39 of the
Revised Statutes and the number of motor vehicles stops that are initiated by
the State Police due to the exceptions provided under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides the
provisions of the bill are to preempt any law, ordinance, resolution or
regulation adopted by the governing body of a county or municipality authorizing
a law enforcement officer to engage in any conduct that is prohibited under the
bill or otherwise inconsistent with the bills provisions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
nothing in the bills provisions or Title 39 of the Revised Statutes is to be
construed to preempt or prohibit any law, ordinance, resolution, or regulation
from being adopted by the governing body of a county or municipality that
imposes restrictions in addition to those set forth under the bill on the role
of law enforcement officers in the enforcement of violations of Title 39 of the
Revised Statutes, including, but not limited to assigning the enforcement of
violations of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes to local officials or personnel
rather than law enforcement officers or imposing additional limitations on the
actions of law enforcement officers during a motor vehicle stop for a violation
of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     According to the sponsor,
contactless policing would be beneficial to the community and law enforcement
officers.  It would allow law enforcement officers to police crime and not
people.  Contactless policing would result in the elimination of millions of motor
vehicle stops each year.  As the average police stop takes up to 15 minutes,
this would free up a law enforcement officers time to police crime and engage
in community policing.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For example, law enforcement
officers now know if a drivers registration and insurance are valid before
initiating a motor vehicle stop by performing a simple registration check.  As
a result, it would not be necessary for a law enforcement officer to initiate a
motor vehicle stop in order to issue a citation, but rather the search would
reveal the infraction and the officer would be able to issue a citation by mail
without initiating an interaction with the driver.   The intent of this is to
reduce the loss of all lives at the hands of law enforcement officers by using technology
to reduce pretextual stops, during which a driver is detained for a minor
infraction while law enforcement seek evidence of a more serious crime.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     According to the sponsor,
community policing creates opportunities for interaction between community
members and law enforcement officers, not only in the context of an officer
responding to a crime.  This results in more interaction in general, but more
importantly, more positive interaction.  Effective community policing requires
altering a law enforcement departments policies, practices, and guiding
philosophies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     According to the sponsor, in
analyzing police data of motor vehicle stops, multiple studies have found
support for the veil of darkness theory: as the sun sets and it becomes more
difficult to determine the race of the driver, the percentage of black drivers
stopped by law enforcement officers for motor vehicle violations decreases
significantly, with a 10 to 15 percent decrease in many jurisdictions.  Often,
these motor vehicle stops of black drivers are pretextual. Sandra Bland was
stopped for failing to signal a turn.  Philando Castile was stopped because his
brake light was out, the last of his 52 stops by police.  Eric Garner was
stopped for selling loose cigarettes.  Duante Wright was stopped for expired
tags.   </p>

<div class=WordSection4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     None of these individuals
survived their encounters with law enforcement.  This disproportionate
targeting of black drivers by the police is the State action that the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted to address.</p>
