(1)   The division shall prepare an application form for recertification.  The application shall be an online application available on the divisions Internet website.

(3)   Upon approval of an application, a certificate issued pursuant to this section shall be valid for five years, subject to the annual certification verification statement.  Every five years thereafter, but no later than 20 days prior to the expiration of the businesss current certification, and not earlier than 60 days prior to the expiration of the certification, a business interested in remaining certified as an LGBTQ+ business shall comply with the certification procedures in this subsection. (4)   An applicant shall fully and accurately complete all relevant parts of the Uniform Certification Application.  Failure to complete an application may result in denial. (5)   Annually, the business shall submit, not more than 20 days prior to the anniversary of the certification, an annual Certification Verification Statement, in which it shall attest that there is no change in the ownership, control, or any other factor of the business affecting eligibility for certification as an LGBQ+ business. e.     (1)  If the business fails to submit the annual certification verification statement by the anniversary date, the certification will lapse and the business shall be removed from the SAVI.  If the business seeks to be re-certified, it shall reapply for certification pursuant to subsection d. of this section.

and (2)   a statement as to whether the appellant requests an opportunity for an in-person presentation and the reason(s) for the request. d.    The director, or designated hearing officer, may disregard any appeal filed after the 10-day period. e.     The appeal accepted by the director or designated hearing officer shall be resolved pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).  The determination issued by the director, or designated hearing officer, shall be a final agency decision, which shall be appealable to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court. f.     The director, or designated hearing officer, is entitled to request, receive, and review copies of any and all records and documents deemed appropriate and relevant to the issues and arguments set forth in the appeal.  Upon receipt of the request by the director or designated hearing officer, a business shall promptly provide the requested records or information.  The director or designated hearing officer may also consider relevant information requested and received from other parties deemed appropriate. g.    A business who receives a decision from the division that the denial or revocation has been reaffirmed may reapply for certification one year after the original date of denial or revocation.]1 1[8.  a.  A third-party may challenge the qualifications of an applicant, or a certified entity, pursuant to this act for eligibility to be certified as an LGBTQ+ business and be included in the SAVI database. b.    A third-party finding cause to challenge the certification of an LGBTQ+ business shall submit an appeal to the director, or designated hearing officer, setting forth, in detail, the grounds for the challenge in a written statement with copies to the challenged business.  The challenge shall contain the specific grounds for challenging the certification, including all arguments, materials, or other documentation that may support the challengers position.  A challenge pursuant to this subsection is limited to the authenticity of a business pursuant to this act to be certified as an LGBTQ+ business.  The right to challenge a currently certified LGBTQ+ business is in addition to, and independent of, any protest hearing rights that are afforded by any State contracting agency. c.     When the division, or designated hearing officer, receives a challenge, the division shall notify the affected business in writing. d.    (1)  Upon proper notice, the division or designated hearing officer shall conduct a hearing on the matter pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).  The determination issued by the director, or designated hearing officer, shall be a final agency decision, which shall be appealable to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court;
