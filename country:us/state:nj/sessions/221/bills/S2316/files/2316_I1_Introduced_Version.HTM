employed in public schools and supplementing chapter 27 of Title 18A of the New
Jersey Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.   (1)     In each
public school having an enrollment of less than 300 students on October 15 of
the prior school year, the board of education shall employ, at a minimum, one
half-time staff member who holds an educational services certificate with a
school library media specialist endorsement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In each public school
having an enrollment of between 300 and 1,499 students on October 15 of the
prior school year, the board of education shall employ, at a minimum, one
full-time staff member who holds an educational services certificate with a
school library media specialist endorsement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   In each public school
having an enrollment of 1,500 or more students on October 15 of the prior
school year, the board of education shall employ, at a minimum, two full-time
staff members who hold an educational services certificate with a school library
media specialist endorsement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Commissioner of
Education may, upon application by a board of education, waive the staffing
requirements established pursuant to subsection a. of this section for up to
one school year if the application demonstrates that the school was unable to
find a certified school library media specialist and that an offer of
employment was made to a certified school library media specialist. The
commissioner may not grant more than two waivers within a period of five school
years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In addition to the
staffing requirements established pursuant to subsection a. of this section, a
public school having an enrollment of 500 or more students on October 15 of the
prior school year shall employ, at a minimum, one full-time staff member to serve
as a library clerk, and shall employ one additional full-time staff member to
serve as a library clerk for each additional 500 students enrolled in the
school. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.   A school library
media specialist employed pursuant to section 1 of this act in a secondary
school in the district shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   in a secondary school
having an enrollment of less than 100 students on October 15 of the prior
school year, devote at least one period in each school day to school library
work;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   in a secondary school
having an enrollment of between 100 and 299 students on October 15 of the prior
school year, devote at least two periods in each school day to school library
work;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   in a secondary school
having an enrollment of between 300 and 499 students on October 15 of the prior
school year, devote at least one-half of each school day to school library
work;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   in a secondary school
having an enrollment of between 500 and 699 students on October 15 of the prior
school year, devote at least five periods in each school day to school library
work; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   in a secondary school
having an enrollment of 700 or more students on October 15 of the prior school
year, devote the full school day to school library work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    As used in this section,
school library work means the delivery of instruction in information literacy
skills; the development and coordination of school library media programs and
resources; and the delivery of instruction in the evaluation, selection,
organization, distribution, creation, and utilization of school library media. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    This act shall take
effect immediately and shall first be applicable to the first full school year
following enactment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes minimum
ratios of school library media specialists to students required in school
districts.  The ratios are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>in each public school having an enrollment of less than 300
students on October 15 of the prior school year, the board of education is
required to employ, at a minimum, one half-time staff member who holds an educational
services certificate with a school library media specialist endorsement;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>in each public school having an enrollment of between 300 and
1,499 students on October 15 of the prior school year, the board of education
is required to employ, at a minimum, one full-time staff member who holds an
educational services certificate with a school library media specialist
endorsement; and</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:39.0pt;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>in each public school having an enrollment of 1,500 or more
students on October 15 of the prior school year, the board of education is
required to employ, at a minimum, two full-time staff members who hold an educational
services certificate with a school library media specialist endorsement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies how much
time in each school day the school library media specialist is required to
devote to school library work in public secondary schools, which is dependent
upon the enrollment in the school. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires a
public school having an enrollment of 500 or more students on October 15 of the
prior school year to employ a minimum of one full-time staff member to serve as
a library clerk, and to employ one additional full-time staff member to serve
as a library clerk for each additional 500 students enrolled in the school.            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to be college- and
career-ready in the twenty-first century, students must be able to use a wide
range of information resources including books, media, technology, and the
Internet.  All students must be able to locate, evaluate, and interpret information
accurately for academic and professional success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A qualified school library
media specialist is uniquely suited through educational training and
professional development to provide this educational foundation for all
students.  Many states currently require school library media specialists in
their schools and most use student enrollment to determine the number of school
library media specialists the schools employ.  </p>
