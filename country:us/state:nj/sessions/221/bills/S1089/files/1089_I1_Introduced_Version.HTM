<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) As used in

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At the time of hire means
after offer and acceptance of employment and before or upon the commencement of
employment. For an employee jointly employed by a covered employer and a labor
contractor, as defined in section 9 of P.L.2019, c.212 (C.34:11-58.2), the time
of hire shall be the first day of the employees placement with the covered
employer, provided that the employee has not performed work for the covered
employer during the previous thirty days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Bona fide business reason
means:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A covered employer

organizational demands, including: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   A significant and
quantifiable inability of the covered employer, despite best efforts, to
reorganize work among existing employees; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   A significant and
quantifiable detrimental effect on business performance; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   A significant and

under the same trade name or brand or that are characterized by standardized

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commissioner means the

work, including but not limited to chain establishments or franchises
associated with a chain of establishments, or network of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>franchises, that employ 250 or more
employees in aggregate.  In determining the number of employees, all employees
including but not limited to those employed on a full-time, part-time,
seasonal, or temporary basis, shall be counted, including workers placed with
the covered employer through a labor contractor, provided that where the number
of employees fluctuates, the number of employees shall be determined for the
current calendar year based upon the average number of employees employed per
week during the preceding calendar year, and provided further that in determining
the number of employees employed by or for a chain business, the total number
of employees in that group of establishments shall be counted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Covered establishment means

shall bear the burden of proof that the individual is an independent contractor
rather than an employee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Employer means any
individual, partnership, association, corporation or business trust or any
other person or group of persons, or a successor thereof, that employs an
individual, and includes any entity, person, or individual acting directly or
indirectly in the interest of the employer in relation to the employee.  More
than one entity may be the employer if employment by one employer is not completely
disassociated from employment by the other employer.  Employer shall include,
in the case of a client employer and a labor contractor providing workers to
the client employer, both the client employer and the labor contractor, both of
whom shall be subject to joint and several liability pursuant to section 9 of

a place where sleeping accommodations are supplied for pay to transient or
permanent guests, in which 15 or more rooms are available for rental furnished
or unfurnished; except this definition shall not include summer camps and
country clubs that are not part of a hotel or motel establishment.</p>

timely, good faith process that includes a discussion between the covered
employer and the employee for the purpose of arriving at a mutually beneficial
arrangement of a work schedule that meets the needs of the employee and the

employees work schedule. The employer shall revise the estimate when there is
a significant change to the employees work schedule due to changes in the
employees availability or to the employers business needs.  The estimate is
not a contractual offer binding the employer, but an estimate made without a

not violate the requirements of this section when an employees average weekly
work hours significantly exceed the number provided in the good faith estimate

date of the currently posted work schedule.  Thereafter, the employer shall
provide written notice of work hours pursuant to subsection b. of this section
no later than 14 days prior to the first day of any new schedule.  Nothing in

whether they are scheduled to work any hours in the schedule.  </p>

employees regular hourly wage for any scheduled hours the employee does not
work when the covered employer cancels or subtracts hours from a regular or
on-call shift, provided that the employee shall, for any shift for which the
hours of work were reduced, be paid, in combined wages and predictability pay,
not less than the equivalent of four hours of pay at the employees regular
hourly wage.</p>

result of a mutually agreed upon shift trade or coverage arrangement between
employees, subject to any existing employer policy regarding required
conditions for employees to exchange shifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A failure to make any payment

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   For the week in which
the individual has left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to
such work, and for each week thereafter until the individual becomes reemployed
and works eight weeks in employment, which may include employment for the
federal government, and has earned in employment at least ten times the
individual's weekly benefit rate, as determined in each case.  This subsection
shall apply to any individual seeking unemployment benefits on the basis of
employment in the production and harvesting of agricultural crops, including
any individual who was employed in the production and harvesting of
agricultural crops on a contract basis and who has refused an offer of
continuing work with that employer following the completion of the minimum
period of work required to fulfill the contract.  This subsection shall not
apply to an individual who voluntarily leaves work with one employer to accept
from another employer employment which commences not more than seven days after
the individual leaves employment with the first employer, if the employment
with the second employer has weekly hours or pay not less than the hours or pay
of the employment of the first employer, except that if the individual gives
notice to the first employer that the individual will leave employment on a
specified date and the first employer terminates the individual before that
date, the seven-day period will commence from the specified date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Misconduct&quot; means
conduct which is improper, intentional, connected with the individual's work,
within the individual's control, not a good faith error of judgment or
discretion, and is either a deliberate refusal, without good cause, to comply
with the employer's lawful and reasonable rules made known to the employee or a
deliberate disregard of standards of behavior the employer has a reasonable
right to expect, including reasonable safety standards and reasonable standards
for a workplace free of drug and substance abuse. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event the discharge
should be rescinded by the employer voluntarily or as a result of mediation or
arbitration, this subsection (b) shall not apply, provided, however, an
individual who is restored to employment with back pay shall return any
benefits received under this chapter for any week of unemployment for which the
individual is subsequently compensated by the employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the discharge was for gross
misconduct connected with the work because of the commission of an act punishable

from benefits because of misconduct under this subsection (b), the burden of
proof is upon the employer, who shall, prior to a determination by the
department of misconduct, provide written documentation demonstrating that the
employee's actions constitute misconduct or gross misconduct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   If it is found that the
individual has failed, without good cause, either to apply for available,
suitable work when so directed by the employment office or the director or to
accept suitable work when it is offered, or to return to the individual's
customary self-employment (if any) when so directed by the director.  The
disqualification shall continue for the week in which the failure occurred and
for the three weeks which immediately follow that week, as determined:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   In determining whether
or not any work is suitable for an individual, consideration shall be given to
the degree of risk involved to health, safety, and morals, the individual's
physical fitness and prior training, experience and prior earnings, the
individual's length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in
the individual's customary occupation, and the distance of the available work
from the individual's residence.  In the case of work in the production and
harvesting of agricultural crops, the work shall be deemed to be suitable
without regard to the distance of the available work from the individual's
residence if all costs of transportation are provided to the individual and the
terms and conditions of hire are as favorable or more favorable to the
individual as the terms and conditions of the individual's base year
employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this chapter, no work shall be deemed suitable and benefits
shall not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for
refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions: the position
offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;
the remuneration, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are
substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for
similar work in the locality; or, the individual, as a condition of being
employed, would be required to join a company union or to resign from or
refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   If it is found that this
unemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor
dispute at the factory, establishment or other premises at which the individual
is or was last employed, except as otherwise provided by this subsection (d).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   No disqualification
under this subsection (d) shall apply if it is shown that:</p>

participating in or financing or directly interested in the labor dispute which
caused the stoppage of work; and</p>

belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement
of the stoppage, there were members employed at the premises at which the
stoppage occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly
interested in the dispute; provided that if in any case in which (a) or (b)
above applies, separate branches of work which are commonly conducted as
separate businesses in separate premises are conducted in separate departments
of the same premises, each department shall, for the purpose of this
subsection, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment, or other
premises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   For any claim for a
period of unemployment commencing on or after December 1, 2004, no
disqualification under this subsection (d) shall apply if it is shown that the
individual has been prevented from working by the employer, even though the
individual's recognized or certified majority representative has directed the
employees in the individual's collective bargaining unit to work under the
preexisting terms and conditions of employment, and the employees had not
engaged in a strike immediately before being prevented from working.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   For any claim for a
period of unemployment commencing on or after July 1, 2018, no disqualification
under this subsection (d) shall apply if the labor dispute is caused by the
failure or refusal of the employer to comply with an agreement or contract
between the employer and the claimant, including a collective bargaining
agreement with a union representing the claimant, or a State or federal law
pertaining to hours, wages, or other conditions of work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   For any claim for a
period of unemployment commencing on or after July 1, 2018, if the unemployment
is caused by a labor dispute, including a strike or other concerted activities
of employees at the claimant's workplace, whether or not authorized or
sanctioned by a union representing the claimant, but not including a dispute
subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) or (3) of this subsection (d), the
claimant shall not be provided benefits for a period of the first 30 days
following the commencement of the unemployment caused by the labor dispute,
except that the period without benefits shall not apply if the employer hires a
permanent replacement worker for the claimant's position.  A replacement worker
shall be presumed to be permanent unless the employer certifies in writing that
the claimant will be permitted to return to his or her prior position upon
conclusion of the dispute.  If the employer does not permit the return, the
claimant shall be entitled to recover any benefits lost as a result of the
30-day waiting period before receiving benefits, and the department may impose
a penalty upon the employer of up to $750 per employee per week of benefits
lost.  The penalty collected shall be paid into the unemployment compensation
auxiliary fund established pursuant to subsection (g) of R.S.43:21-14.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   For any week with
respect to which the individual is receiving or has received remuneration in
lieu of notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   For any week with
respect to which or a part of which the individual has received or is seeking
unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of any other state
or of the United States; provided that if the appropriate agency of the other
state or of the United States finally determines that the individual is not entitled
to unemployment benefits, this disqualification shall not apply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   (1) For a period of one
year from the date of the discovery by the division of the illegal receipt or
attempted receipt of benefits contrary to the provisions of this chapter, as
the result of any false or fraudulent representation; provided that any
disqualification may be appealed in the same manner as any other
disqualification imposed hereunder; and provided further that a conviction in
the courts of this State arising out of the illegal receipt or attempted
receipt of these benefits in any proceeding instituted against the individual
under the provisions of this chapter or any other law of this State shall be
conclusive upon the appeals tribunal and the board of review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A disqualification under
this subsection shall not preclude the prosecution of any civil, criminal or
administrative action or proceeding to enforce other provisions of this chapter
for the assessment and collection of penalties or the refund of any amounts collected
as benefits under the provisions of R.S.43:21-16, or to enforce any other law,
where an individual obtains or attempts to obtain by theft or robbery or false
statements or representations any money from any fund created or established
under this chapter or any negotiable or nonnegotiable instrument for the
payment of money from these funds, or to recover money erroneously or illegally
obtained by an individual from any fund created or established under this

Pub.L.93-618 (19 U.S.C. s.2296 (a)(1)) nor shall the individual be denied
benefits by reason of leaving work to enter this training, provided the work
left is not suitable employment, or because of the application to any week in
training of provisions in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), or any applicable
federal unemployment compensation law, relating to availability for work,
active search for work, or refusal to accept work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, the New Jersey
Fair Workweek Act, provides that employees may request a change to their work
schedules without fear of retaliation or adverse action, and requires that
employers consider these requests in good faith.  The bill also requires employers
to provide more predictable and stable schedules for employees in certain
low-wage occupations.  For the purposes of this bill, employer is defined as
any employer that employees 250 or more employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires an employee,
upon hire, to provide an employer with a written request of the employees
preferred schedule; and requires the employer to provide a good-faith estimate
of the employees projected schedule. An employee may make requests for a
change to the schedule, and the employer is required to work in good faith to
accommodate these requests if possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires an employer
to provide, transmit, and post notice of an employees schedule at least 14
days prior to the start of the work period that schedule covers.  The employer
is required to give prior notice to affected employees of any revision of the
posted schedule and post the revised schedule within 24 hours.  An employee is
allowed to decline to work any shifts that are not posted in such a manner.  The
bill provides for employees to receive predictability pay for any work schedule
change that occurs after the abovementioned advanced notice has been provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the provisions of the
bill, an employee may decline any shifts scheduled less than twelve hours after
the end of the employees most recent shift.  Any shifts worked by the employee
within 12 hours of their most recent shift shall be compensated with rest
shortfall pay at one-and-a-half times the employees normal rate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires an employer
to increase the shifts of existing employees, within the limits of the law,
before hiring new employees capable of performing the same tasks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides for an
employer to keep records detailing its compliance with these requirements, and
for those records to be accessible to the employees concerned. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill makes it an unlawful
employment practice for any employer to interfere with, restrain, or deny the
existence or the right to exercise, any right of an employee as set forth in
the bill. Under the bill, it is unlawful for any employer to discharge,
threaten to discharge, demote, suspend, reduce work hours of, or take any other
adverse employment action against any employee in retaliation for exercising
the rights of an employee under the bill or opposing any practice made unlawful
by the bill.  The bill provides that, in respect to employees whose work
requires substantially similar skills, duties, and responsibility, an employer
shall not discriminate against any employee on the basis of their hours worked.

where the employee does not initiate a civil action under current law, for the
Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development or the Attorney General to
bring a civil action against a covered employer in violation or alleged to be
in violation of the bill or other State wage and hour laws.  Under the bill, an
employee or employee representative may, after providing the commission an
opportunity to investigate the complaint, bring a civil action on behalf of the
State, but the right of the employee to bring a civil action under the bill
terminates if the commissioner initiates an enforcement action regarding the
complaint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires an employer
to pay an employee nine times the employees regular wage, or the minimum wage,
whichever is larger, in retention pay for every 7-day work period; with an
employees normal pay or paid time-off counting toward compliance with this
requirement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires every
employer subject to its provisions to post and keep conspicuously posted, in
the establishment and location where notices or postings to employees and
applicants for employment are customarily posted, a notice setting forth the
pertinent provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill does not apply to
collective bargaining agreements if the agreement waives specific provisions
that are covered within the bill, so long as the agreement addresses the topic
of employee scheduling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends P.L.1965,
c.173 (C.34:11-4.10) to add certain penalties for labor violations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends P.L.2019,
c.212 (C.34:11-58.2) to include this bill under prohibited retaliations against
employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends R.S.34:11-57
and P.L.2009, c.194 (C.34:1A-1.11) to include itself under the definition of
State wage and hour laws, thus allowing for penalties imposed under other
state wage and hour laws to apply to violations of this bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill amends
R.S.43:21-5 to prevent absences caused by employer violations of its provisions
from affecting employee eligibility for unemployment compensation.</p>
