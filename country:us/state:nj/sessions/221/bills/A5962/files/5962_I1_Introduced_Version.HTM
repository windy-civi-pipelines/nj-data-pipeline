The bill creates a rebuttable presumption that a person has engaged in the predatory marketing of fentanyl to minors if the person has been convicted of using a juvenile in a fentanyl distribution scheme, distributing fentanyl within 1,000 feet of school property, or distributing fentanyl to persons under age 18.  The bill also specifies that a conviction for predatory marketing of fentanyl to minors will not merge, for sentencing purposes, with a conviction for the underlying crime of drug distribution. The bill provides that predatory marketing of fentanyl to minors is a crime of the first degree.  A crime of the first degree is ordinarily punishable by a term of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.  However, under the bill, the term of imprisonment is increased to 30 years, during which the person is not eligible for parole, or the court may impose a specific term of imprisonment which could be between 30 years and life imprisonment of which the person is required to serve 30 years before being eligible for parole. The bill also amends the Drug Dealer Liability Act, N.J.S.A.2C:35B-1 et seq., to allow a minor or a person who accidentally uses or is exposed to fentanyl to bring a civil suit against all persons who participated in the predatory marketing of fentanyl.
