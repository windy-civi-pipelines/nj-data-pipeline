<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  (New section) 
Beginning with the State fiscal year 2023 and each fiscal year thereafter, the
Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the
Treasury shall establish a separate fringe benefit rate for State public higher
education institutions, including Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey,
the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and State colleges and universities. 
The separate fringe benefit rate shall reflect the actual cost of employee
retirement programs at public institutions of higher education, and shall be applied
to all federal, dedicated, and non-State funded programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The payments to the
State in accordance with the new rate established by the director shall not be
reduced from the payments that would be required using the rate calculated in
accordance with the process used prior to the effective date of this act,
P.L.    , c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(pending before the Legislature as
this bill), by more than $47,000,000 of the difference between the total amount
as calculated using the new rate and as calculated using the rate in accordance
with the process used prior to the effective date of this act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     For purposes of
applying to federal and other government agencies, including, but not limited
to, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, and
to private entities and foundations, for research and other grants, principal investigators
and other faculty members employed by State public higher education
institutions shall use the separate fringe benefit rate that reflects that
actual cost of employee retirement programs calculated in accordance with subsection
a. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 1 of P.L.2003,
c.172 (C.52:14-17.33a) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a. Notwithstanding any
provision of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.) to the contrary, a
part-time State employee, or a part-time faculty member, including part-time
lecturers and adjunct faculty members, at a State public institution of higher
education in this State if the public institution of higher education
participates in the program, who is enrolled in a State-administered retirement
system shall be eligible to participate in the State Health Benefits Program
and may purchase health benefits coverage under the program in the State
managed care plan as defined in section 2 of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.26) for
the employee or faculty member and the dependents of the employee or faculty
member. If such an employee or faculty member elects to enroll in the program,
the employee or faculty member shall pay the full cost of the coverage selected
and the employer shall not be responsible for any costs in connection with the
purchase of the coverage, unless the employer shall be obligated to pay all or
a portion of such costs in accordance with the provisions of a binding
collective negotiations agreement </p>

any provision of P.L. 1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.) to the contrary, a

fractional appointments and adjunct faculty members, employed by a public
institution of higher education in the State, including Rutgers, the State
University of New Jersey, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, State
colleges and universities, and county colleges, shall be eligible to enroll in
the NJ Direct 2019 or the Omnia Tiered Network plans offered by the program, or
in substantially equivalent plans that may replace NJ Direct 2019 or the Omnia
Tiered Network plans, provided the part-time faculty member satisfies the
following conditions: (a) during the immediately prior fiscal year, July 1
through June 30, the part-time faculty member taught courses totaling at least
24 credits at one or more public institutions of higher education during the
summer session, fall semester, winter session, or spring semester; and  (b) the
part-time faculty member is appointed to teach courses totaling at least 12

are satisfied for enrollment in the plans, the part-time faculty member shall
be considered a full-time employee pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
program and eligibility for health care benefits shall commence on July 1 and
continue through September 30 of the immediately following fiscal year to avoid
interruptions in health care coverage for eligible part-time faculty members.  Part-time
faculty members qualifying for health care benefits may enroll in any level of
coverage.   </u></p>

care benefits pursuant to this subsection during the prior fiscal year, but
satisfies the condition of teaching courses totaling at least 24 credits at one
or more public institutions of higher education during the summer session, fall

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires that,
beginning with the State fiscal year 2023, the Director of the Division of
Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury will establish a
separate fringe benefit rate for State public higher education institutions. 
The separate fringe benefit rate will reflect the actual cost of employee
retirement programs at those colleges and universities, and will be applied to
all federal, dedicated, and non-State funded programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The payments to the State in
accordance with the new rate established by the director by the payments that
would be required using the rate calculated in accordance with the process used
prior to the effective date of the act by more than $47 million of the
difference between the total amount as calculated using the new rate and as
calculated using the rate in accordance with the process used prior to the
effective date of this bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the fringe
rate used is not specific to employees at the States public colleges and
universities, but to State employees in general.  This can cause inequities as
many State employees are enrolled in <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>the
Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), while many of the employees
employed by State public colleges and universities as enrolled in the Alternative
Benefit Plan (ABP).  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends current
law to change the eligibility of a part-time faculty member, including
part-time lecturers, faculty holding fractional appointments, and adjunct
faculty members, employed by a public institution of higher education in the
State to enroll in two plans offered by the State Health Benefits Program. 
Under the bill a part-time faculty member would be considered a full-time
faculty member if they satisfy the following conditions: (a) during the
immediately prior fiscal year, July 1 through June 30, the part-time faculty
member taught courses totaling at least 24 credits at one or more public
institutions of higher education during the summer session, fall semester,
winter session, or spring semester; and (b) the part-time faculty member is
appointed to teach courses totaling at least 12 credits between July 1 and
December 31 of the current fiscal year.  The bill provides an opportunity to
meet the conditions at separate times and subsequently enroll in SHBP. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For example, under the bill if
a part-time faculty member taught courses totaling at least 24 credits between
July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022, and on August 15, 2022 the faculty member
receives notice of appointments to teach 12 credits between September 1, 2022
and December 31, 2022, then the part-time faculty member will be deemed
eligible to enroll in the SHBP effective September 1, 2022 and health care
benefits will continue through September 30, 2023.  If during the 2023 fiscal
year (July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023), the part-faculty member again
satisfies the condition of teaching 24 credits, the part-time faculty members
health care benefits will continue through September 30, 2024, provided the
faculty member also satisfies the condition of being appointed to teach 12
credits between July 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     U<span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>nder current law, adjunct faculty members are eligible for enrollment in
the SHBP if the employer is participating in the SHBP and the adjunct is
enrolled in the pension system, but the employer is not responsible for any
cost associated unless </span>a binding collective negotiations agreement<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'> requires the employer to assume some or all of the
SHBP cost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     The
bill also specifies that the State Health Benefits Commission will </span>promulgate
rules to bill public institutions of higher education employing part-time
faculty who satisfy the eligibility requirements for enrollment in the SHBP. 
Billing will be proportional based on the number of credits a part-time faculty
member taught in the prior fiscal year at a public institution of higher
education.  In addition, the commission will promulgate rules to designate the
public institution of higher education that will have responsibility for
enrolling the part-time faculty member in the SHBP. 12/21/2023</p>
