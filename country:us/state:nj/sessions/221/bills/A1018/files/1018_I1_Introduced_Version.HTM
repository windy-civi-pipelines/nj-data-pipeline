<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises the requirements
for the licensure and operation of mobile intensive care units and personnel
operating on those units.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill identifies several
new categories of licensure with regard to prehospital care: advanced
paramedics; paramedic assistants; mobile intensive care nurses; specialty care
transport nurses; paramedic support units; and mobile integrated care units. 
The bill additionally revises the requirements for paramedic licensure and for
licensure of mobile intensive care units.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, mobile
intensive care programs operated by a hospital may provide, in addition to
advanced life support services through a mobile intensive care unit, mobile
integrated health care and specialty care transport services.  Mobile
integrated health care is the provision of non-emergent health care services by
an advanced paramedic or registered nurse using patient-centered, mobile
resources, including alternative treatment modalities in response to
non-emergent 9-1-1 calls; providing community paramedicine care, chronic
disease management, preventative care, and post-discharge follow-up visits; and
providing referrals and transportation assistance to patients who do not
require hospital-based treatment.  Specialty care transport is the
inter-facility transportation of a patient in need of care that exceeds the
scope of practice for a basic life support unit, which would ordinarily provide
transportation services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes a mobile intensive
care unit to be operated by a paramedic operating with another paramedic, a
mobile intensive care nurse, or an advanced paramedic, or by an advanced
paramedic and a paramedic assistant, which, under the bill, is a professional
licensed to provide intermediate life support.  Specialty care transport units
would be staffed by a specialty care transport nurse and at least one other
professional certified as an emergency medical technician (EMT).  The bill
additionally authorizes paramedic support units, which would be staffed by at
least one advanced paramedic and used to provide both mobile integrated health
care and support to mobile intensive care units responding to an emergency
call.  Units may hold multiple licenses at one time, provided that they meet
the qualification requirements for each type of license held. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill will not revise the
current requirements for a hospital to be authorized to develop and provide a
mobile intensive care program or the primary response areas in which hospitals
are authorized to provide services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes in, but
not of, the Department of Health, the Advanced Life Support (ALS) Oversight
Board.  The ALS Oversight Board will be responsible for: (1) establishing and
maintaining written standards for the licensure of paramedics, advanced
paramedics, and paramedic assistants; (2) establishing education or equivalency
standards for advanced paramedics and standards for the approval of advanced
paramedic training programs; (3) establishing and maintaining written standards
for the acknowledgement of mobile intensive care nurses and specialty care
transport nurses; (4) establishing the scope of practice and medical protocols
for paramedic assistants and paramedics; (5) approving medical protocols for
advanced paramedics; (6) establishing equivalency standards for approval of
out-of-State health care professionals, including paramedics, other emergency
medical services personnel, members of the military, and federal law
enforcement officers to train and practice in the State; (7) providing advice
to the Commissioner of Health concerning the promulgation of regulations and on
other aspects concerning advanced life support, mobile integrated health care,
specialty care transport, and other aspects of prehospital care; and (8) such
other duties as are expressly provided under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The membership of the board
will comprise the agency directors and agency medical directors of mobile
intensive care programs authorized to operate in the State, as well as two paramedics,
one mobile intensive care nurse, and one specialty care transport unit nurse. 
Agency medical directors are board-certified emergency physicians who provide
medical oversight for a hospital mobile intensive care program, while agency
operational directors are paramedics, or nurses holding a valid EMT
certification, who are responsible for oversight and administration of the
programs mobile intensive care units, mobile integrated care units, and
specialty care transport units.  Each mobile intensive care program is required
to have both an agency director and an agency medical director.  The chair of
the board, who will be appointed by the Commissioner of Health and will serve
at the commissioners pleasure, is required to be a licensed physician who is
board certified in emergency medicine or emergency medical services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In general, the scope of
practice and protocols authorized for a given paramedic, advanced paramedic,
paramedic assistant, mobile intensive care nurse, specialty care transport nurse,
mobile intensive care unit, paramedic support unit, mobile integrated care
unit, or specialty care transport unit will be authorized by that
professionals or units agency medical director, consistent with standards
established by the ALS Oversight Board and subject to board approval.  However,
the ALS Oversight Board will have exclusive authority to determine the scope of
practice for advanced paramedics.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Advanced paramedics will be
required, at a minimum, to hold a bachelors degree in paramedicine; however,
until bachelors degree programs in paramedicine become available in New
Jersey, the ALS Oversight Board will have the authority to establish the
minimum education, training, and experience requirements for licensure.  The
board will continue to have the authority to establish these requirements even
after an accredited paramedicine degree program becomes available in the State
and the degree becomes a minimum requirement for advanced paramedic licensure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill repeals sections 1 through
14 of P.L.1984, c.146 (C.26:2K-7 et seq.), which set forth the current
licensing and operational requirements for mobile intensive care units, and
P.L.1985, c.351 (C.26:2K-21 et seq.), which established the now obsolete
EMT-intermediate pilot program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors belief
that this bill will foster an enhanced and more dynamic system of prehospital
care in the State through the use of a diversified licensing structure,
community-based mobile integrated health care designed to prevent unnecessary
hospital utilization, and additional types of mobile care units, including
mobile integrated care units and paramedic support units.  It is the sponsors
hope that this new system of prehospital care will increase access to care by
improving paramedic distribution and allowing faster response times, improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of the State emergency medical services
system, and that this reformed system of prehospital care may lead to other
innovative healthcare solutions that may become available and prudent as the
healthcare care delivery system evolves.</p>
