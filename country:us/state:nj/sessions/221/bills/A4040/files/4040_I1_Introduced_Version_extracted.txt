Under the bill, a long-term care facility is to permit a resident or residents guardian or legal representative to designate at least two essential caregivers, who are to be authorized to visit in person with the resident during any declared emergency or during an outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic of an infectious disease affecting or likely to affect a long-term care facility.  The designated essential caregivers are to be documented in the residents plan of care.  Essential caregiver visits are to be for periods of time that are at least equal to the time afforded by federal and State law to residents of long-term care facilities for in-person visitation under normal circumstances. Under the bill, the following information is to be posted on the Internet website of each long-term care facility, and is to be transmitted by each long-term care facility, in writing, to residents or residents guardians or legal representatives:  the rights of residents to designate at least two essential caregivers in the event of a declared emergency or during an outbreak, epidemic, or a pandemic of an infectious disease affecting or likely to affect a long-term care facility; the process by which essential caregivers may be designated; and any associated requirements. The bill provides that a long-term care facility may require an essential caregiver to agree in writing to the long-term care facilitys visitation policies and procedures.  A long-term care facility may restrict or revoke visitation for an essential caregiver who violates the long-term care facilitys visitation policies and procedures.  An essential caregiver, who acts in accordance with the long-term care facilitys visitation policies and procedures, is not to have visitation restricted or revoked.  In addition, a long-term care facility is not to impose on essential caregivers any protocols that are stricter than the infection control and prevention protocols that are imposed on the facilitys employees. Under the bill, the Department of Health is to take such actions as are necessary to identify, investigate, and ensure long-term care facilities are in compliance with the bills provisions. It is the sponsors belief that this bill is necessary to protect long-term care residents, as visitation restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in social isolation and other detrimental effects on the health and well-being of long-term care residents.
