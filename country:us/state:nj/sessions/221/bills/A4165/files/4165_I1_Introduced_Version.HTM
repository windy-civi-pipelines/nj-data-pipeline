<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill clarifies the sales
tax collection responsibilities of horse boarding businesses in New Jersey by
providing an exemption from the sales and use tax for the lease or rental of
stable stalls and charges for horse boarding and other related services.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the taxable
service of furnishing space for storage is redefined to exclude from tax
charges for the lease or rental of stable stalls.  The bill provides that the
service of furnishing space for storage does not include, and the taxable
service therefore does not apply to, charges for the lease or rental of a stall
in a barn, stable, or other similar structure or facility for the boarding or
stabling or for the keeping or holding of a horse, pony, mule, donkey, or
hinny.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill similarly exempts
from tax charges for boarding a horse. The bill provides that charges for
storing a horse, pony, mule, donkey, or hinny in a barn, stable, or other
similar structure or facility by a person engaged in the business of boarding
or stabling or otherwise keeping or holding horses, ponies, mules, donkeys, or
hinnies are exempt from the sales tax.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill exempts
from tax services that are provided for the care of horses, ponies, mules,
donkeys, or hinnies boarded by persons engaged in the business of boarding
horses.  The bill provides that charges for maintaining or servicing a horse,
pony, mule, donkey, or hinny that is boarded or stabled or that is kept or held
in a barn, stable, or other similar structure or facility by a person engaged
in the business of boarding or stabling or otherwise keeping or holding horses,
ponies, mules, donkeys, or hinnies are exempt from the sales tax.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill takes effect
immediately and applies to lease and rental agreements entered into, and to
charges for services rendered, on or after the first day of the first month of
the first calendar quarter beginning at least 90 calendar days after the date
of enactment.  The bill provides transitional rules that apply to agreements
covering periods beginning and ending before and on or after the date the
exemptions provided by the bill first apply.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of this bill is to
clarify the tax collection responsibilities of horse boarding businesses, and
to provide for a more equitable treatment of livestock kept under the care of
farmers in this State.  The Division of Taxation in the Department of the
Treasury has failed to provide clear and consistent guidance on the taxability
of boarding and other services provided to horses that are boarded for a
variety of different purposes by different types of boarding businesses, and
has adopted rules and regulations that have led to differences in the tax
treatment of boarding horses in comparison to other livestock that receive more
favorable treatment as farm animals.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     These actions have created
confusion within the agricultural community and increased the cost of doing
businesses for horse boarding and other farm businesses attempting to maintain
compliance with current law.  The actions have also placed New Jersey horse
boarding and other farm businesses at a competitive disadvantage with similar
businesses in surrounding states that do not require businesses to collect tax
on charges for boarding horses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     By providing an exemption for
all horse boarding and related services, this bill eliminates the confusion and
reduces the overall cost of doing business within this State.  Moreover, by
providing an exemption, the bill levels the playing field for New Jersey horse
boarding businesses and their out-of-State counterparts, and provides for a
more equitable treatment of all livestock kept under the care of farmers.</p>
