MCKEON District 27 (Essex and Passaic) Co-Sponsored by: Senator Space SYNOPSIS Permits persons at horse racetracks and off-track wagering facilities to place wagers on previously-recorded live horse races. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act permitting persons at horse racetracks and off-track wagering facilities to place wagers on previously-recorded live horse races, and supplementing chapter 5 of Title 5 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  As used in this section: previously-recorded live race means a previously-recorded live running or harness horse race which does not identify the actual race on which pari-mutuel wagers are placed by a person using an electronic pari-mutuel wagering terminal located at a racetrack or off-track wagering facility in this State. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law or rule or regulation to the contrary, it shall be lawful for the New Jersey Racing Commission to authorize a permit holder that is licensed to conduct a horse race meeting in this State or an off-track wagering licensee to accept, under regulation of the commission, wagers on previously-recorded live races, with wagers placed through either electronic pari-mutuel wagering terminals located at a licensed racetrack facility or an off-track wagering facility by persons who are physically present at those racetracks or facilities. c.     To effectuate the provisions of this section, the commission shall, pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), promulgate rules and regulations necessary to: (1)   evaluate the type of equipment that may be used in wagering, subject to approval by the commission; (2)   authorize the permit holder to enter into contracts with vendors, operators, and other entities, as may be necessary, for the establishment and operation of the electronic pari-mutuel wagering terminals; (3)   ensure that proper payments are made to the winning bettors who shall share the gross amount wagered minus the applicable commission, and that remaining amounts are properly distributed among the permit holder or licensee, applicable partner entities, and horse racing and breeding industry stakeholders in accordance with subsection d. of this section; (4)   ensure that necessary safeguards are in place to guarantee the security and integrity of the electronic pari-wagering terminals and of the pari-mutuel wagering conducted thereon and to prevent minors from wagering; (5)   ensure that the information provided on the previously-live race is true and accurate as of the day of the race and does not provide any information that might help patrons identify the actual race, including the date of the race, the race course, the names of the horses, riders, drivers, or trainers; (6)   ensure that the live pool wagering types offered are identical with those offered in the previously-recorded live race; (7)   ensure that the system allows for pari-mutuel wagering on a horse race displayed as a video or audio recording, but does not authorize wagering on any animation, computer simulation or other artificial representation of horse racing; and (8)   regulate any other aspects of the electronic pari-mutuel wagering operation the commission deems appropriate. d.    As used in this subsection, "takeout" means that portion of a wager which is deducted from or not included in the pari-mutuel pool, and which is distributed other than to persons placing wagers. The takeout rate for a previously-recorded live race shall be not more than 20 percent, and shall be 20 percent in the absence of an agreement prescribing a lesser takeout percentage. The amount resulting from the takeout rate for previously-recorded live race wagering conducted at a racetrack or at an off-track wagering facility shall be distributed as follows: 15 percent to purses; 1 percent to breeder awards and 4 percent to Sire Stakes or State-bred awards; 15 percent to race technology fees; 3 percent to simulcasting and video usage fees; and 62 percent to the permit holder. e.     An excise tax shall be imposed on all tracks and off-track wagering facilities conducting pari-mutuel wagering on previously-recorded live races under the jurisdiction of the commission at a rate of 1.5 percent of all money wagered on previously-recorded live races at the track during the State fiscal year.  Money shall be deducted from the tax paid as follows: (1)   an amount equal to 1.2 percent of all money wagered on previously-recorded live races shall be deposited into the General Fund and dedicated specifically to the Department of the Treasury to be used to pay the States required annual contribution to the State-administered retirement systems; (2)   an amount equal to 0.1 percent of all money wagered on previously-recorded live races shall be distributed to the New Jersey Racing Commission for operations and administration; (3)   an amount equal to 0.05 percent of all monies wagered on previously live races shall be deposited in a dedicated nonlapsingtrust and revolving fund to support the Equine Science Center at Rutgers University; (4)   an amount equal to 0.05 percent of all monies wagered on previously-recorded live races shall be deposited in a special trust account for the construction, expansion, or renovation of facilities or the purchase of equipment for equine programs at public institutions of higher education; and (5)   an amount equal to 0.1 percent of all money wagered on previously-recorded live races shall be distributed to the New Jersey Racing Commission to support equine drug testing on live horse races. The excise tax imposed herein shall not apply to pari-mutuel wagering on live or simulcast horse races. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection d of this section to the contrary, a portion of the amount resulting from the take-out rate that is dedicated for purses to the Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association of New Jersey or to a standardbred permit holder, and to the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association or to a thoroughbred permit holder, may be expended for other purposes that benefit the racing and breeding industries in this State, pursuant to an agreement between the respective permit holder and association, and subject to reporting in the annual financial reports required to be submitted to the commission.  The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as to abrogate any contractual agreement among permit holders in this State providing for previously-live race wagering revenue sharing. g.    Subject to rules and regulations of the commission, a racetrack or off-track wagering facility may commingle previously-recorded live race wagers into interstate common pools for previously-recorded live race wagering. h.    The provisions of this section shall be construed as severable and if any part of this section is held unconstitutional, or for any other reason invalid, any remaining parts thereof shall not be affected thereby. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would permit wagering at racetracks and off track wagering facilities in this State on previously-recorded live running or harness horse races that do not identify the actual race.  Pari-mutuel wagers of the same pool type would be placed using an electronic pari-mutuel wagering. The bill provides that the "takeout" or that portion of a wager which is deducted from or not included in the parimutuel pool, and which is distributed other than to persons placing wagers, will not be more than 20 percent, and will be 20 percent in the absence of an agreement prescribing a lesser takeout percentage.  The takeout rate amount for previously-recorded live wagering conducted at an off-track wagering facility or at a racetrack will be distributed as follows: 15 percent to purses; 1 percent to breeder awards and 4 percent to Sire Stakes or State-bred awards; 15 percent to race technology fees; 3 percent to simulcasting fees; and 62 percent to the permit holder, who shall be responsible for operating expenses, marketing, and awards.  Under the bill, previously-recorded live race wagers may be commingled into interstate common pools for previously-recorded live race wagering. The bill also imposes a tax at a rate of 1.5 percent of money wagered on previously-recorded live races during the State fiscal year.  A portion of these revenues will be dedicated to pay for public employee retirement benefits, New Jersey Racing Commission expenses, support of the Equine Science at Rutgers University, equine programs at public institutions of higher education, and equine drug testing. The bill further provides that a portion of the amounts dedicated for purses to the Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association of New Jersey or to a standardbred permit holder, and to the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association or to a thoroughbred permit holder, may be expended for other purposes that benefit the racing and breeding industries in this State, pursuant to an agreement between the respective permit holder and association, and subject to reporting in the annual financial reports required to be submitted to the commission.  The distributions established in the bill would not be construed as to abrogate any contractual agreement among permit holders in this State providing for previously-recorded live racing revenue sharing. Under the bill, the New Jersey Racing Commission would promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement the bills provisions.
