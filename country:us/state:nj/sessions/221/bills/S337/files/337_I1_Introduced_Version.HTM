<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  The pilot program
established pursuant to section 2 of this act shall be funded through the
Medicaid program using a value-based payment system.  The value-based payment
system shall be modeled on, and be consistent with, the population-based
payment methodology that is described under Category 4 of the alternative
payment methodologies (APM) framework developed by the Health Care Payment
Learning and Action Network.  Specifically, the value-based payment system
shall provide for a quarterly advanced bundled payment to be provided to the
managed care organization for the purposes of financing the total cost of
behavioral health care that is provided by participating urgent care
facilities.  The quarterly bundled payment rate shall be established by the
Commissioner of Human Services and shall be based on the commissioners
evaluation of the following factors:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   an assessment of claims
data indicating the cost to provide behavioral health care in hospital
emergency departments and inpatient settings, absent the pilot program; </p>

who are expected to be served by the pilot program; </p>

participating urgent care facilities of complying with the provisions of
subsection d. of section 2 of this act; and</p>

established by the commissioner under subsection a. of this section, and shall
not be subject to increase, regardless of whether the actual costs of care
received by patients in the pilot program exceed the bundled payment rate
provided hereunder.  If the managed care organization, in cooperation with
participating urgent care facilities, is able to reduce the per-patient costs
of care for patients receiving care and services under the pilot program, the
managed care organization may retain, and shall not be required to repay, any
remaining unexpended bundled payment funds.  Any such savings achieved shall be
shared by the managed care organization with participating urgent care
facilities at a rate that is proportional to the rate of per-patient cost
reduction savings achieved by each such facility.  If the actual per-patient
costs of care for patients receiving care and services under the pilot program
exceed the advanced bundled payment rate established by the commissioner under
this section, the managed care organization shall ensure that all patients
continue to receive appropriate services and care from participating urgent
care facilities without being subject to an increase in out-of-pocket costs. 
Any financial loss incurred by the managed care organization as a result of an
increase in the per-patient cost of care for patients receiving care and
services under the pilot program shall be shared by the managed care
organization with participating urgent care facilities at a rate that is
proportional to the rate of per-patient cost increase attributed to each
facility.  </p>

Services (DHS) to establish a two-year Urgent Care Facility Behavioral Health
Pilot Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The goal of the program will
be to provide behavioral health care at hospital urgent care facilities to
stabilize individuals experiencing behavioral health crises in a way that
reduces unnecessary emergency department and inpatient admissions.  In doing
so, it is the sponsors goal to provide quality, timely behavioral health care
in a setting that offers positive patient outcomes, addresses the stigma
associated with behavioral health issues, reduces the burden on hospital
emergency room departments, and minimizes costs.  Under the bill, behavioral
health or behavioral health care means procedures or services rendered by a
health care or mental health care provider for the treatment of a mental
illness, a mental health or emotional disorder, or a substance use disorder.  </p>

effective date of the bill or, if the DHS submits State plan amendments or
waivers to receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid for services provided
under the bill, within 30 days of the receipt of any necessary federal
approvals, the DHS is required to issue a request for proposals and select one
or more Medicaid managed care organizations to participate in the pilot
program.  Under the bill, the two-year pilot program is to commence upon the
selection of the managed care organizations.  The managed care organizations
selected are to demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements of the pilot
program and are required to operate in each of the northern, central, and
southern regions of the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The selected managed care

determining which hospitals to contract with, the selected managed care
organizations are to prioritize hospitals that specialize in pediatric care if
feasible.  Under the bill, a participating urgent care facility is required to
provide services 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  Furthermore, to be
eligible, a hospital is to demonstrate the ability to coordinate a patients
care with primary care providers, outpatient behavioral health and substance
abuse providers, community health centers, and social service providers, and
may not receive funding from the DHS to provide Early Intervention Support
