institution of slavery and its legacy of systemic racial discrimination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Four hundred years ago
this year, enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown, Virginia as captives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    From 1619 to 1865,
approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their descendants, under a practice that
was constitutionally and statutorily sanctioned, were enslaved in the United
States and the colonies that became the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The system of slavery
that flourished in the United States constituted an immoral, shameful, and
inhumane deprivation of the life, liberty, humanity, citizenship, and cultural
heritage of Africans and also denied them, among other things, the fruits of
their own labor upon which this country, and its economy, was built.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    An overwhelming body of
scholarship, legal and community evidentiary documentation, and the modern day
lived experiences of the descendants of enslaved Africans form the basis for
inquiry into the ongoing effects of the institution of slavery and its legacy
of persistent systemic structures of discrimination on living Black people and
communities in the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Following the abolition
of slavery, state actors at the federal, state, and local level continued to
perpetuate, condone, and profit from practices that continued to brutalize and
systemically disadvantage Black people, including sharecropping, convict
leasing, Jim Crow laws, redlining, unequal education, and disproportionate
treatment at the hands of the criminal justice system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Contrary to what many
people believe, slavery was not just a Southern institution and took root very
deeply in New Jersey.  In the early 17th Century, the first enslaved African
people arrived in New Netherland, a Dutch settlement established in the
Mid-Atlantic, which included portions of present day New Jersey.  As the demand
for labor increased, the number of enslaved African people imported to New
Jersey increased, with Bergen County becoming the largest slaveholding county
in the Province of New Jersey.  In 1704, the Province of New Jersey introduced
the Slave Code, which prohibited enslaved Africans and free Africans from
owning property and made certain actions, like staying out past curfew, illegal
for Black people.  Although New Jersey outlawed the importation of enslaved
Africans in 1786 and enacted a law in 1804 to abolish slavery gradually, the
State Legislature passed Peace Resolutions in 1863 denying President
Lincolns power to emancipate slaves and later voted against the 13th amendment
to the United States Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    In 1844, New Jersey also
restricted access to the ballot box by denying the vote to people with criminal
convictions the same year it restricted voting to white men, the first Northern
state to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    While many Northern
states abolished slavery following the Civil War, New Jersey opposed the
Emancipation Proclamation and was the last Northern state to abolish slavery. 
Following the Civil War, New Jersey refused to ratify the Reconstruction
Amendments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     New Jerseys deep roots
in American slavery and its vestiges have endured to the present day.  A direct
line can be traced from New Jerseys role in American slavery to its system
today of voter suppression, racial wealth disparities, mass incarceration,
racial segregation, and crumbling infrastructure in Black communities in New
Jersey, such as the current elevated lead levels in water and homes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     The full effects of the
institution and legacy of slavery on Black people and communities in New Jersey
have not been sufficiently examined, nor have there been remedies for past
injustice and present harm, or sufficient efforts at transformation.  As a
result of historic and continued systemic racial discrimination, Black people
in New Jersey confront some of the worst racial disparities in America,
including but not limited to these areas:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Access to Democracy: New
Jersey suffers from racialized voter disenfranchisement, denying the vote to
over 100,000 people in prison, on parole, or on probation, according to State
data.  Almost half are Black, though Black people comprise just 15 percent of
the States population.  The racism of the criminal justice system is directly
imported into the franchise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Youth Justice:
Generations of Black kids have experienced racism in the youth justice system. 
Just two years after the Civil War, New Jersey opened Jamesburg, its largest
youth prison for boys.  Today, Black children are 30 times more likely to be
locked up than white children, the highest disparity rate in America, even
though Black and white children commit most offenses at similar rates.  As of
May 1, 2019, just eight white children are incarcerated in New Jersey, compared
to 113 Black children, according to State data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Housing and the Racial
Wealth Gap: New Jersey also experienced racially restrictive covenants that
prohibited Black people from buying, leasing, or occupying property based on
race, and redlining, which targeted Black people who were refused housing
loans.  That legacy of systemic housing discrimination spills into todays vast
discrepancy in New Jersey home ownership rates: 75.8 percent for white
households and 37.8 percent for Black households.  Because home ownership is a
primary driver of wealth, Black and Latino people in New Jersey confront one of
the worst racial wealth gaps in America.  The median net worth for New Jerseys
white families is $309,000, the highest in the nation.  For New Jerseys Black
and Latino families, it is incredibly just $5,900 and $7,020, respectively,
according to the Prosperity Now Scorecard.  New Jersey also leads the nation in
home foreclosures, according to ATTOM Data Solutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Racial Segregation: Racial
segregation itself, born from the vestiges of slavery, pervades New Jersey,
which, while one of the most racially diverse states in America, is also among
the most segregated. New Jerseys racial diversity and racial segregation,
combined with its extreme wealth and punishing poverty, has created in New
Jerseys public classrooms some of the fiercest segregation by race, ethnicity,
and income in this country. Nearly half of New Jerseys Black and Latino
students attend schools that are more than 90 percent nonwhite. Almost
two-thirds go to schools that are more than 75 percent nonwhite.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    To address these
systemic challenges in New Jersey, the New Jersey Reparations Task Force will
research, write, and publish a report that will make the case for State-based
reparations in New Jersey and outline policy recommendations that seek to
repair the harm that has resulted from Americas original sin in the Garden
State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     It is in the interest
of the State and of the people of New Jersey for the government to initiate and
foster methods of improving knowledge and understanding between
African-Americans and other ethnic groups in New Jersey and to adopt and initiate
means to foster communication and dialogue, for the purpose of achieving truth,
transformation, and reparation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.   Therefore, it is in the
interest of the State and the people of New Jersey to establish the New Jersey
Reparations Task Force to urge New Jersey to take responsibility for its role
in American slavery and its aftermath, and to set forth comprehensive and
sweeping policy recommendations aimed to develop profound and reparative
financial and other investments in Black communities impacted by New Jerseys
history of systemic racial discrimination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.    The urgency for the
establishment of this task force is compelling.  The elder African-American
population, some of whom are the grandchildren of formerly enslaved Black
people and can bear direct witness to some of the severest forms of racism and
oppression, is advancing in age.  As too many generations of Black people have
already passed without benefit of any remedies for the injustices they endured,
it is important that New Jersey make the establishment of this task force an
imperative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    There is hereby
established in the Department of State in the Executive Branch of the State
Government a task force to be known as the New Jersey Reparations Task Force.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The task force shall
consist of 11 members, at least seven of whom shall be public members, to be
appointed as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.     The New Jersey
Reparations Task Force shall organize as soon as practicable after the
appointment of a majority of its members and shall select a chair and a vice
chair among its members and a secretary who need not be a member of the task
force.  The presence of six members of the task force shall constitute a
quorum.  The task force may conduct business without a quorum, but may only
vote on recommendations when a quorum is present.  The task force may incur
traveling and other miscellaneous expenses as it may deem necessary, within the
limits of funds made available to it for its purposes.  Members of the task
force shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for expenses
actually incurred in the performance of their duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The Governor shall call
the first meeting of the task force to occur on or before the first day of the
third month after enactment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The task force shall
invite public comment, including testimony at its meetings, on the issues the
task force is required to address as part of its responsibilities, in a manner
that encourages public participation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Department of State
shall publicize the task forces mission and procedures on the departments
website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The task force shall be

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   the capture and
