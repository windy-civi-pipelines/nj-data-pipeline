The amount hereinabove appropriated for Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid shall be distributed on the following schedule: on or before August 1, 45% of the total amount due; September 1, 30% of the total amount due; October 1, 15% of the total amount due; November 1, 5% of the total amount due; December 1 for municipalities operating under a calendar fiscal year, 5% of the total amount due; and June 1 for municipalities operating under the State fiscal year, 5% of the total amount due; provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the Director of Local Government Services, in consultation with the Commissioner of Community Affairs and the State Treasurer, may direct the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting to provide such payments on an accelerated schedule if necessary to ensure fiscal stability for a municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, from the amounts received from the appropriation to the Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid program and received from amounts transferred from Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid to the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid account, each municipality shall be required to distribute to each fire district within its boundaries the amount received by the fire district from the Supplementary Aid for Fire Services program pursuant to the provisions of the fiscal year 1995 annual appropriations act, P.L.1994, c.67, less an amount proportional to reductions in the combined total amount received by the municipality from Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid and from the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund/Aid account since fiscal year 2008.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that proportional amounts of the Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid and the amounts transferred from Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid to the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid account appropriated to offset losses from business personal property tax that would have otherwise been used for the support of public schools will be used to reduce the school property tax levy for those affected school districts with the remaining State Aid used as municipal property tax relief. The chief financial officer of the municipality shall pay to the school districts such amounts as may be due by December 31. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the release of the total annual amount due for the current fiscal year from Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid to municipalities is subject to the following condition: the municipality shall submit to the Director of the Division of Local Government Services a report describing the municipality's compliance with the "Best Practices Inventory" established by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services and shall receive at least a minimum score on such inventory as determined by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services; provided, however, that the director may take into account the particular circumstances of a municipality. In preparing the "Best Practices Inventory," the director shall identify best municipal practices in the areas of general administration, fiscal management, and operational activities, as well as the particular circumstances of a municipality, in determining the minimum score acceptable for the release of the total annual amount due for the current fiscal year. The Director of the Division of Local Government Services may permit any municipality that received "Regional Efficiency Aid Program" funds pursuant to the annual appropriations act for fiscal year 2010, P.L.2009, c.68, to use a portion of its Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid or Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid, or both Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid and Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid, to provide "Regional Efficiency Aid Program" benefits pursuant to P.L.1999, c.61 (C.54:4-8.76 et seq.).

Of the amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities, an amount may be allocated by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services to provide short-term financial assistance to a local government unit that is determined by the director to be experiencing financial distress caused by the destruction or loss of a major local business ratable.  For purposes of this paragraph, a major local business ratable means one or more related parcels of property owned by a single business entity, classified as commercial or industrial, which comprised the largest assessed valuation of any one or more line items of taxable property in a municipality, or generated an annual PILOT payment in excess of 10% of the total municipal levy, or is otherwise determined by the director to be of such significance to a municipality that its destruction or loss has resulted in financial distress; provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services may direct that part of any such allocation be paid to an affected school district or county, or to both, in the same manner as if the award of Transitional Aid were raised as revenue from the municipal tax levy; and provided further that a local government unit determined to be experiencing financial distress because of the loss or destruction of a major local business ratable shall not be required to be subject to any additional conditions, requirements, orders, or other operational efficiency or oversight measures authorized pursuant to P.L.2011, c.144 (C.52:27D-118.42a), except as determined to be appropriate by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services. Of the amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities, amounts may be allocated by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services to any State agency or department, county, or county improvement authority to pay for services provided to or on behalf of a participating municipal government unit pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between that State agency or department, county, or county improvement authority, as applicable and the Division of Local Government Services, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. The amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities is subject to the following condition:  notwithstanding the provisions of R.S.43:21-14, or any other law or regulation to the contrary, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, in consultation with the Commissioner of Community Affairs, is authorized to enter into individualized payment plan agreements with municipalities that receive Transitional Aid for the reimbursement of unemployment benefits paid to former employees of such municipal government units, at reasonable interest rates based on current market conditions, and on such other terms and conditions as may be determined to be appropriate by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development.  Any municipality that enters into an individualized payment plan agreement pursuant to this section shall be required to expend all funds budgeted for this activity remaining as of the last day of its budget year for the repayment of outstanding obligations under the plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities shall be allocated to provide short-term financial assistance where needed to help a municipality that is in serious fiscal distress meet immediate budgetary needs and regain financial stability.  A municipality shall be deemed to be eligible for transitional aid if it is identified by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services as experiencing serious fiscal distress where the director determines that, despite local officials having implemented substantive cost reduction strategies, there continue to exist conditions of serious fiscal distress, which may include but shall not be limited to: substantial structural or accumulated deficits; ongoing reliance on non-recurring revenues; limited ability to raise supplemental non-property tax revenues; extraordinary demands for public safety appropriations; and other factors indicating a constrained ability to raise sufficient revenues to meet budgetary requirements that substantially jeopardizes the fiscal integrity of the municipality.  Municipalities seeking transitional aid shall file an application on a form prescribed by the director, which application, among other things, shall set forth the minimum criteria that must be met in order for an application to be considered by the director for a determination of eligibility. The director shall determine whether a municipality which files an application meeting such minimum criteria is in serious fiscal distress, and, if so, what amount of transitional aid should be provided to address the municipality's serious fiscal distress. The transitional aid shall be provided to the municipality subject to the provisions of subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2011, c.144 (C.52:27D-118.42a); provided, however, that an amount of Transitional Aid to Localities as determined by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services for a municipality may be deemed to constitute Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid in an amount not in excess of the amount of Transitional Aid to Localities such municipality received in the previous fiscal year and shall not reduce the amount of Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid such municipality shall receive for the current fiscal year. Provided, however, if the Director of the Division of Local Government Services deems an amount of Transitional Aid to Localities for a municipality as constituting Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid pursuant to this provision, that municipality is not relieved from compliance with the requirements for transitional aid. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection d. of section 29 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-29) or subsection d. of section 30 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-30), or any law or regulation to the contrary, all payments to municipalities in lieu of taxes for lands acquired by the State and non-profit organizations for recreation and conservation purposes shall be retained by the municipality and not apportioned in the same manner as the general tax rate of the municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, payments to municipalities in lieu of taxes for lands acquired by the State and non-profit organizations for recreation and conservation purposes shall be provided only to the municipalities whose payments received in fiscal year 2010 exceeded $5,000 and shall be provided at the payment amount provided in fiscal year  2024, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, any qualifying municipality, as defined in section 1 of P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178) for the previous fiscal year, shall continue to be a qualifying municipality thereunder during the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, whenever funds appropriated as State Aid and payable to any municipality, which municipality requests and receives the approval of the Local Finance Board, such funds may be pledged as a guarantee for payment of principal and interest on any bond anticipation notes issued pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2003, c.15 (C.40A:2-8.1) and any tax anticipation notes issued pursuant to N.J.S.40A:4-64 by such municipality. Such funds, if so pledged, shall be made available by the State Treasurer upon receipt of a written notification by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services that the municipality does not have sufficient funds available for prompt payment of principal and interest on such notes, and shall be paid by the State Treasurer directly to the holders of such notes at such time and in such amounts as specified by the director, notwithstanding that payment of such funds does not coincide with any date for payment otherwise fixed by law. The State Treasurer, in consultation with the Commissioner of Community Affairs, is empowered to direct the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting to transfer appropriations from any State department to any other State department as may be necessary to provide a loan for a term not to exceed 180 days to a local government unit faced with a fiscal crisis, including but not limited to a potential default on tax anticipation notes and on such other terms and conditions as may be required by the commissioner. Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.40A:4-39 or any other law or regulation to the contrary, a county that assumes responsibility for the provision of local police services in one or more municipalities utilizing a new or expanded county police force may display the anticipated revenues and appropriations associated with such county police force in its annual budget by annexing to that budget a statement describing the sources and amounts of anticipated dedicated revenues and appropriating those dedicated amounts for the purposes of the county police force. The amount hereinabove appropriated for Bloomfield, Belleville, and Nutley Fire Departments  Enhanced Safety and Training (PTRF) shall be used to support the construction of a training tower and other programs to enhance the service quality of the fire departments in Bloomfield, Belleville, and Nutley. 76  Management and Administration DIRECT STATE SERVICES 99-8070 Administration and Support Services $8,429,000 Total Direct State Services Appropriation, Management and Administration $8,429,000 Direct State Services: Personal Services: Salaries and Wages ($3,822,000) Materials and Supplies ($8,000) Services Other Than Personal ($59,000) Maintenance and Fixed Charges ($16,000) Special Purpose: 99 Office of Information Privacy (P.L.2021, c.371) ($3,000,000) 99 Government Records Council ($524,000) 99 Sustainable New Jersey Fund ($1,000,000) Department of Community Affairs, Total State Appropriation $1,197,465,000 All moneys comprising original bond proceeds or the repayment of loans or advances from the Mortgage Assistance Fund established under the "New Jersey Mortgage Assistance Bond Act of 1976," P.L.1976, c.94, are appropriated in accordance with the purposes set forth in section 5 of that act.

Any hospital that meets more than one of the categories pursuant to this paragraph shall only receive a Charity Care subsidy equal to the percentage of documented charity care that is the highest. Until approval by the federal government is received of the charity care subsidy payment methodology, State funds may be used to fund the entirety of the charity care subsidy using the methodology described above. The amount appropriated for City of Newark Access to Health Care Partnership shall support a program administered by Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, in partnership with University Hospital, to improve access to health care for the residents of the City of Newark.  The partnership shall present a report on the implementation and results of the program to the Commissioner of Health no later than May 30.

In the event that a hospital did not report its Medicaid managed care days on the cost report utilized in this calculation, the Department of Health (DOH) shall ascertain Medicaid managed care encounter days for Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare clients as reported by insurers to the State as per source data defined in (b) above; (d) Medicaid managed care DME cost begins with the intern and residency program costs using the 2022 submitted Medicaid cost report total residency costs, reported on Worksheet B Pt I Column 21 Line 21 plus Worksheet B Pt I Column 22 Line 22 divided by the 2022 resident full time equivalent employees (FTE), reported on Worksheet S-3 Pt 1 Column 9 line 14 to develop an average cost per resident FTE for each hospital; (e) median cost per resident FTE is calculated based on the average cost per resident FTE for each hospital; (f) the median cost per resident FTE is multiplied by the 2022 resident FTEs reported on Worksheet S-3 Pt 1 Column 9 Line 14 to develop total median residency program cost for each hospital; (g) median residency costs are multiplied by the ratio of Medicaid managed care days, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 7 Line 2, divided by the difference of total days, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 8 Line 14, less nursery days, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 8 Line 13 to determine the Medicaid managed care DME cost of each hospital; (h) Medicaid managed care IME cost is defined as the Medicare IME factor multiplied by Medicaid managed care encounter payments as per source data defined in (b) above; (i) the IME factor is calculated using the Medicare IME formula as follows: 1.35 * ((1 + x) ^0.405 - 1), in which x is the ratio of submitted IME resident FTEs reported on Worksheet S-3 Pt 1 Column 9 Line 14 divided by the difference of total available beds, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 2 Line 14, less nursery beds, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 2 Line 13; (j) total 2022 Medicaid managed care GME costs shall equal total 2022 Medicaid managed care IME costs plus total 2022 Medicaid managed care DME costs; (k) the 2022 total Medicaid managed care DME costs is divided by the total 2022 Medicaid managed care GME costs; (l) the DME allocation portion is calculated by multiplying the total subsidy amount by the ratio in (k) above; (m) each hospitals percentage of total 2022 Medicaid managed care DME costs shall be multiplied by the DME allocation to calculate its DME payment; (n) the 2022 total Medicaid managed care IME costs are divided by the total 2022 Medicaid managed care GME costs; (o) the IME allocation portion is calculated by multiplying the total subsidy amount by the ratio in (n) above; (p) each hospitals percentage of total 2022 Medicaid managed care IME costs shall be multiplied by the IME allocation to calculate its IME payment; (q) the sum of a hospitals DME and IME payments shall equal its subsidy payment. The total GME Subsidy amount and these payments shall not exceed $218,000,000 and shall be paid in 12 monthly payments; (r) in the event that a hospital believes that there are mathematical errors in the calculations, or data not matching the actual source documents used to calculate the subsidy as defined above, hospitals shall be permitted to file calculation appeals within 15 working days of receipt of the subsidy allocation letter. If upon review it is determined by the DOH that the error has occurred and would constitute at least a five percent change in the hospitals allocation amount, a revised industry-wide allocation shall be issued; (s) each hospital receiving a GME allocation shall, on or before May 31, 2025, provide a report to the Commissioner of Health indicating the total number of physicians who completed their training during the preceding calendar year, and the number of those physicians who plan to practice medicine within the State of New Jersey.

The initial determination of whether a county hospital rate exceeds the per capita rate that counties pay to the State on behalf of applicable patients residing in a State psychiatric facility will be based on a comparison of estimated cost used to set reimbursement rates for the upcoming calendar year. A second comparison of the actual per diem costs of the county psychiatric hospital and State psychiatric hospitals will be completed after actual cost reports for the period are available including an inflationary adjustment for the six-month difference in fiscal reporting periods between State and county hospitals.

(5) each of the hospitals located in the ten municipalities in the State containing a hospital that have the lowest median annual household income according to Table S1901 from the 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Yr Estimate Released December 7, 2023, shall be ranked from the hospital with the highest hospital-specific reimbursed Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare managed care outpatient hospital services to the hospital with the lowest hospital-specific reimbursed Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare managed care outpatient hospital services, as calculated on managed care encounter payments for which NJ FamilyCare was the primary payer for calendar year 2022, with payment dates between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2023, with a run-date of not later than September  12, 2023, and the hospital in each of the ten municipalities, if any, with the highest reimbursed Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare managed care outpatient hospital services shall receive a 25 percent increase to their designated tier's add-on payment, unless such hospital is publicly owned; (6) hospitals shall receive interim  quarterly Medicaid managed care outpatient hospital payments on or about the 15th of the first month of each  quarter based on calendar year 2022 outpatient visits as calculated in (5) above, which shall be reconciled to actual fiscal year utilization in the subsequent fiscal year's April payment.  In addition, notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, from the amounts hereinabove appropriated for the General Medical Services program classification, the Department of Human Services shall conduct an assessment of the viability and cost to the State of a supplemental Medicaid add-on payment to physician practices that are affiliated with hospital systems for services provided to Medicaid recipients, which may differentiate based on delivery systems employed in different health systems.

Of the amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities, amounts may be allocated by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services to any State agency or department, county, or county improvement authority to pay for services provided to or on behalf of a participating municipal government unit pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between that State agency or department, county, or county improvement authority, as applicable and the Division of Local Government Services, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. The amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities is subject to the following condition:  notwithstanding the provisions of R.S.43:21-14, or any other law or regulation to the contrary, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, in consultation with the Commissioner of Community Affairs, is authorized to enter into individualized payment plan agreements with municipalities that receive Transitional Aid for the reimbursement of unemployment benefits paid to former employees of such municipal government units, at reasonable interest rates based on current market conditions, and on such other terms and conditions as may be determined to be appropriate by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development.  Any municipality that enters into an individualized payment plan agreement pursuant to this section shall be required to expend all funds budgeted for this activity remaining as of the last day of its budget year for the repayment of outstanding obligations under the plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities shall be allocated to provide short-term financial assistance where needed to help a municipality that is in serious fiscal distress meet immediate budgetary needs and regain financial stability.  A municipality shall be deemed to be eligible for transitional aid if it is identified by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services as experiencing serious fiscal distress where the director determines that, despite local officials having implemented substantive cost reduction strategies, there continue to exist conditions of serious fiscal distress, which may include but shall not be limited to: substantial structural or accumulated deficits; ongoing reliance on non-recurring revenues; limited ability to raise supplemental non-property tax revenues; extraordinary demands for public safety appropriations; and other factors indicating a constrained ability to raise sufficient revenues to meet budgetary requirements that substantially jeopardizes the fiscal integrity of the municipality.  Municipalities seeking transitional aid shall file an application on a form prescribed by the director, which application, among other things, shall set forth the minimum criteria that must be met in order for an application to be considered by the director for a determination of eligibility. The director shall determine whether a municipality which files an application meeting such minimum criteria is in serious fiscal distress, and, if so, what amount of transitional aid should be provided to address the municipality's serious fiscal distress. The transitional aid shall be provided to the municipality subject to the provisions of subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2011, c.144 (C.52:27D-118.42a); provided, however, that an amount of Transitional Aid to Localities as determined by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services for a municipality may be deemed to constitute Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid in an amount not in excess of the amount of Transitional Aid to Localities such municipality received in the previous fiscal year and shall not reduce the amount of Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid such municipality shall receive for the current fiscal year. Provided, however, if the Director of the Division of Local Government Services deems an amount of Transitional Aid to Localities for a municipality as constituting Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid pursuant to this provision, that municipality is not relieved from compliance with the requirements for transitional aid. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection d. of section 29 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-29) or subsection d. of section 30 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-30), or any law or regulation to the contrary, all payments to municipalities in lieu of taxes for lands acquired by the State and non-profit organizations for recreation and conservation purposes shall be retained by the municipality and not apportioned in the same manner as the general tax rate of the municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, payments to municipalities in lieu of taxes for lands acquired by the State and non-profit organizations for recreation and conservation purposes shall be provided only to the municipalities whose payments received in fiscal year 2010 exceeded $5,000 and shall be provided at the payment amount provided in fiscal year  2024, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, any qualifying municipality, as defined in section 1 of P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178) for the previous fiscal year, shall continue to be a qualifying municipality thereunder during the current fiscal year. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, whenever funds appropriated as State Aid and payable to any municipality, which municipality requests and receives the approval of the Local Finance Board, such funds may be pledged as a guarantee for payment of principal and interest on any bond anticipation notes issued pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2003, c.15 (C.40A:2-8.1) and any tax anticipation notes issued pursuant to N.J.S.40A:4-64 by such municipality. Such funds, if so pledged, shall be made available by the State Treasurer upon receipt of a written notification by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services that the municipality does not have sufficient funds available for prompt payment of principal and interest on such notes, and shall be paid by the State Treasurer directly to the holders of such notes at such time and in such amounts as specified by the director, notwithstanding that payment of such funds does not coincide with any date for payment otherwise fixed by law. The State Treasurer, in consultation with the Commissioner of Community Affairs, is empowered to direct the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting to transfer appropriations from any State department to any other State department as may be necessary to provide a loan for a term not to exceed 180 days to a local government unit faced with a fiscal crisis, including but not limited to a potential default on tax anticipation notes and on such other terms and conditions as may be required by the commissioner. Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.40A:4-39 or any other law or regulation to the contrary, a county that assumes responsibility for the provision of local police services in one or more municipalities utilizing a new or expanded county police force may display the anticipated revenues and appropriations associated with such county police force in its annual budget by annexing to that budget a statement describing the sources and amounts of anticipated dedicated revenues and appropriating those dedicated amounts for the purposes of the county police force. The amount hereinabove appropriated for Bloomfield, Belleville, and Nutley Fire Departments  Enhanced Safety and Training (PTRF) shall be used to support the construction of a training tower and other programs to enhance the service quality of the fire departments in Bloomfield, Belleville, and Nutley. 76  Management and Administration DIRECT STATE SERVICES 99-8070 Administration and Support Services $8,429,000 Total Direct State Services Appropriation, Management and Administration $8,429,000 Direct State Services: Personal Services: Salaries and Wages ($3,822,000) Materials and Supplies ($8,000) Services Other Than Personal ($59,000) Maintenance and Fixed Charges ($16,000) Special Purpose: 99 Office of Information Privacy (P.L.2021, c.371) ($3,000,000) 99 Government Records Council ($524,000) 99 Sustainable New Jersey Fund ($1,000,000) Department of Community Affairs, Total State Appropriation $1,197,465,000 All moneys comprising original bond proceeds or the repayment of loans or advances from the Mortgage Assistance Fund established under the "New Jersey Mortgage Assistance Bond Act of 1976," P.L.1976, c.94, are appropriated in accordance with the purposes set forth in section 5 of that act.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the appropriation for the Health Care Subsidy Fund Payments is subject to the following condition: the distribution of charity care subsidy payments shall be calculated using the following methodology: (1) each hospital shall be ranked in order of its hospital-specific, relative charity care percentage, or RCCP, based on the submitted 2022 Acute Care Hospital (ACH) Cost Reports, by dividing the amount of hospital-specific gross revenue for charity care patients by the hospital's total gross revenue for all patients; (2) the ten hospitals with the highest RCCP shall receive a charity care payment equal to 40 percent of each hospital's hospital-specific reimbursed documented charity care, except that such a hospital with an operating margin less than or equal to -15 percent shall receive a Charity Care reimbursement equal to 50 percent of their hospital-specific documented Charity Care, with operating margins being calculated using 2022 audited ACH cost reports with a numerator of Form L3, Line 34 minus Line 12, and a denominator of Form L3, Line 15 minus Line 12 minus Line 31; (3) notwithstanding the provisions of clause (2), the hospital with the highest hospital-specific reimbursed documented charity care in calendar year (CY) 2022 located in each of the ten municipalities in the State containing a hospital, with the lowest median annual household income according to the 2022 5-Year American Community Survey, shall receive a charity care payment equal to 30 percent of its hospital-specific reimbursed documented charity care; (4) an acute care hospital that is deemed to be a Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH), according to s.1923(b) of the Social Security Act, as reported in Medicaid State Plan Rate Year ended June 30, 2018, shall also receive 30 percent of its CY 2022 hospital-specific documented charity care; and (5) a specialty heart hospital shall also receive 30 percent of its CY 2022 hospital-specific documented charity care. Any hospital that meets more than one of the categories pursuant to this paragraph shall only receive a Charity Care subsidy equal to the percentage of documented charity care that is the highest. Until approval by the federal government is received of the charity care subsidy payment methodology, State funds may be used to fund the entirety of the charity care subsidy using the methodology described above. The amount appropriated for City of Newark Access to Health Care Partnership shall support a program administered by Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, in partnership with University Hospital, to improve access to health care for the residents of the City of Newark.  The partnership shall present a report on the implementation and results of the program to the Commissioner of Health no later than May 30.

In the event that a hospital did not report its Medicaid managed care days on the cost report utilized in this calculation, the Department of Health (DOH) shall ascertain Medicaid managed care encounter days for Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare clients as reported by insurers to the State as per source data defined in (b) above; (d) Medicaid managed care DME cost begins with the intern and residency program costs using the 2022 submitted Medicaid cost report total residency costs, reported on Worksheet B Pt I Column 21 Line 21 plus Worksheet B Pt I Column 22 Line 22 divided by the 2022 resident full time equivalent employees (FTE), reported on Worksheet S-3 Pt 1 Column 9 line 14 to develop an average cost per resident FTE for each hospital; (e) median cost per resident FTE is calculated based on the average cost per resident FTE for each hospital; (f) the median cost per resident FTE is multiplied by the 2022 resident FTEs reported on Worksheet S-3 Pt 1 Column 9 Line 14 to develop total median residency program cost for each hospital; (g) median residency costs are multiplied by the ratio of Medicaid managed care days, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 7 Line 2, divided by the difference of total days, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 8 Line 14, less nursery days, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 8 Line 13 to determine the Medicaid managed care DME cost of each hospital; (h) Medicaid managed care IME cost is defined as the Medicare IME factor multiplied by Medicaid managed care encounter payments as per source data defined in (b) above; (i) the IME factor is calculated using the Medicare IME formula as follows: 1.35 * ((1 + x) ^0.405 - 1), in which x is the ratio of submitted IME resident FTEs reported on Worksheet S-3 Pt 1 Column 9 Line 14 divided by the difference of total available beds, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 2 Line 14, less nursery beds, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 2 Line 13; (j) total 2022 Medicaid managed care GME costs shall equal total 2022 Medicaid managed care IME costs plus total 2022 Medicaid managed care DME costs; (k) the 2022 total Medicaid managed care DME costs is divided by the total 2022 Medicaid managed care GME costs; (l) the DME allocation portion is calculated by multiplying the total subsidy amount by the ratio in (k) above; (m) each hospitals percentage of total 2022 Medicaid managed care DME costs shall be multiplied by the DME allocation to calculate its DME payment; (n) the 2022 total Medicaid managed care IME costs are divided by the total 2022 Medicaid managed care GME costs; (o) the IME allocation portion is calculated by multiplying the total subsidy amount by the ratio in (n) above; (p) each hospitals percentage of total 2022 Medicaid managed care IME costs shall be multiplied by the IME allocation to calculate its IME payment; (q) the sum of a hospitals DME and IME payments shall equal its subsidy payment. The total GME Subsidy amount and these payments shall not exceed $218,000,000 and shall be paid in 12 monthly payments; (r) in the event that a hospital believes that there are mathematical errors in the calculations, or data not matching the actual source documents used to calculate the subsidy as defined above, hospitals shall be permitted to file calculation appeals within 15 working days of receipt of the subsidy allocation letter. If upon review it is determined by the DOH that the error has occurred and would constitute at least a five percent change in the hospitals allocation amount, a revised industry-wide allocation shall be issued; (s) each hospital receiving a GME allocation shall, on or before May 31, 2025, provide a report to the Commissioner of Health indicating the total number of physicians who completed their training during the preceding calendar year, and the number of those physicians who plan to practice medicine within the State of New Jersey.

The mail-order program may waive, discount, or rebate the beneficiary copayment and mail-order pharmacy providers may dispense up to a 90-day supply on prescription refills with the voluntary participation of the beneficiary, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Human Services and the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the amount hereinabove appropriated to the Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled (PAAD) program is conditioned upon the Department of Human Services coordinating the benefits of the PAAD program with the prescription drug benefits of the federal "Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003," Pub.L.108-173, as the primary payer due to the current federal prohibition against State automatic enrollment of PAAD program recipients in the federal program. The PAAD program benefit and reimbursement shall only be available to cover the beneficiary cost share to in-network pharmacies and for deductible and coverage gap costs, as determined by the Commissioner of Human Services, associated with enrollment in Medicare Part D for beneficiaries of the PAAD and the Senior Gold Prescription Discount Program, and for Medicare Part D premium costs for PAAD program beneficiaries. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, no funds appropriated in the Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled (PAAD) program and the Senior Gold Prescription Discount Program accounts shall be available as payment as a PAAD program or Senior Gold Prescription Discount Program benefit to any pharmacy that is not enrolled as a participating pharmacy in a pharmacy network under Medicare Part D. Consistent with the requirements of the federal "Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003," Pub.L.108-173, and the current federal prohibition against State automatic enrollment of Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled (PAAD) program recipients, no funds hereinabove appropriated from the PAAD account shall be expended for any individual enrolled in the PAAD program unless the individual provides all data that may be necessary to enroll the individual in Medicare Part D, including data required for the subsidy assistance, as outlined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the amount hereinabove appropriated for the Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled (PAAD) program shall be conditioned upon the following provision: no funds shall be appropriated for the refilling of a prescription drug paid by PAAD as a primary payer until such time as the original prescription is 85 percent finished. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, no amounts hereinabove appropriated for the Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled (PAAD) program shall be expended to cover medications not on the formulary of a PAAD program beneficiary's Medicare Part D plan.  This exclusion shall not apply to those drugs covered by PAAD which are specifically excluded by the federal Medicare Prescription Drug Program.  In addition, this exclusion shall not impact the beneficiary's rights, guaranteed by the "Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003," Pub.L.108-173, to appeal the medical necessity of coverage for drugs not on the formulary of a Medicare Part D plan. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, no amounts hereinabove appropriated for the Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled (PAAD) program shall be expended for diabetic testing materials and supplies which are covered under the federal Medicare Part B program, or for vitamins, cough/cold medications, drugs used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, or cosmetic drugs including but not limited to: drugs used for baldness, weight loss, and skin conditions. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, no funds appropriated in the Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled program classification and the Senior Gold Prescription Discount Program account shall be expended for fee-for-service prescription drug claims with no Medicare Part D coverage except under the following conditions: (1) the maximum allowable cost for legend and non-legend drugs shall be calculated based on Actual Acquisition Cost (AAC) defined as the lowest of (i) the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) Retail Price Survey, developed in accordance with subsection (f) of section 1927 of the Social Security Act;  (ii) Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) less a volume discount, in the absence of a NADAC price, that is consistent with the NJ FamilyCare program; (iii) the federal upper limit; or (iv) the State upper limit (SUL); and (v) cost acquisition data submitted by providers of pharmaceutical services for brand-name multi-source drugs and multi-source drugs in the absence of  any alternative pricing benchmarks; (2) pharmacy reimbursement for legend and non-legend drugs shall be calculated based on (i) the lower of the AAC plus a professional fee, that is consistent with the NJ FamilyCare Program; or a providers usual and customary charge; or (ii) the lower of cost acquisition data submitted by providers of pharmaceutical services for brand-name multi-source and multi-source drugs, where an alternative pricing benchmark is not available, plus a professional fee that is consistent with the NJ FamilyCare Program; or a providers usual and customary charge. For legend drugs purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the maximum allowable cost shall be based on the 340B ceiling price.  In the absence of a 340B ceiling price, the alternative benchmark used shall be the WAC minus a volume discount of 25 percent. The 340B ceiling price or the alternative benchmark shall only apply when its price is the lowest compared to the pricing formulas described by (i) through (v) above. Reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs shall be calculated based on: (i) the lower of the AAC plus a professional fee of $10.92; or a providers usual and customary charge; or (ii) the lower of cost acquisition data submitted by providers of pharmaceutical services for brand-name multi-source and multi-source drugs, where an alternative pricing benchmark is not available, plus a professional fee of $10.92; or a providers usual and customary charge. To effectuate the calculation of SUL rates and/or the calculation of single-source and brand-name multi-source legend and non-legend drug costs where an alternative pricing benchmark is not available, the Department of Human Services shall mandate ongoing submission of current drug acquisition data by providers of pharmaceutical services. No funds hereinabove appropriated shall be paid to any entity that fails to submit required data. All funds recovered under P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.) and P.L.1975, c.194 (C.30:4D-20 et seq.), during the current fiscal year are appropriated for payments to providers in the same program classification from which the recovery originated.
