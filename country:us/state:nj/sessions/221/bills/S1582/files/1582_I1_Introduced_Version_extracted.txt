CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act eliminating the active duty requirements from the veterans gross income tax exemption, amending N.J.S.54A:3-1. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    N.J.S.54A:3-1 is amended to read as follows: 54A:3-1.     Personal exemptions and deductions.  Each taxpayer shall be allowed personal exemptions and deductions against his gross income as follows: (a)   Taxpayer.  Each taxpayer shall be allowed a personal exemption of $1,000.00 which may be taken as a deduction from his New Jersey gross income.

(e)   Nonresidents.  For taxable years to which a certification pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1993, c.320 (C.54A:2-1.2) applies, a nonresident taxpayer shall be allowed the same deduction for personal exemptions as a resident taxpayer.  However, if (1) the nonresident taxpayer's gross income which is subject to tax under this act is exceeded by (2) the gross income which the nonresident taxpayer would be required to report under this act if the taxpayer were a resident by more than $100.00, the taxpayer's deduction for personal exemptions shall be limited by the percentage which (1) is to (2).

STATEMENT This bill eliminates the requirement that a veteran taxpayer serve in active duty status or federal active duty status in order to qualify for the $6,000 veterans gross income tax exemption. Under current law, a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, or a reserve component thereof, who has been honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances, is required to have served in active duty status in order to qualify for the veterans gross income tax exemption, pursuant to N.J.S.A.54A:3-1(b)(7). Likewise, a member of the National Guard of New Jersey, who has been honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances, is required to have served in federal active duty status in order to qualify for the same.  This tax credit may be claimed by the veteran taxpayer for each tax year in which the veteran so qualifies. This bill changes the law to remove the respective active duty requirements.  Accordingly, pursuant to the bill, a veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States, a reserve component thereof, or a member of the National Guard of New Jersey, who has been honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances, may claim the veterans gross income tax exemption, irrespective of whether he or she served in active duty or federal active duty status.
