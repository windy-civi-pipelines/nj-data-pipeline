CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning school psychologists and supplementing chapter 27 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  The board of education of a school district shall, at a minimum, employ and assign on a fulltime basis to each school within the school district at least one school psychologist.  The maximum student to school psychologist ratio per school in a school district shall be 500:1. b.    A school district shall apply for any federal funds which may be available to implement, or to aid in implementing, the provisions of this section. c.     As used in this section, school psychologist means a person who holds a New Jersey standard educational services certificate with a school psychologist endorsement. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall first apply in the second full school year next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires local boards of education to employ and assign on a fulltime basis to each school within the school district at least one school counselor.  The bill also provides that the maximum student to school psychologist ratio per school in a school district will be 500:1. The most recent recommendations of the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) suggest that it is necessary to maintain a ratio of one school psychologist per 500 students in order to provide comprehensive school psychological services. The NASP estimates a national ratio of one school psychologist per 1,211 students, with some states approaching a ratio of one school psychologist per 5,000 students.  School psychologists are uniquely qualified educational services professionals who receive advanced graduate preparation that includes coursework and field experiences relevant to both psychology and education.  It is vital that school districts make school psychologists available to their students to ensure that they receive the best direct support and interventions needed to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.
