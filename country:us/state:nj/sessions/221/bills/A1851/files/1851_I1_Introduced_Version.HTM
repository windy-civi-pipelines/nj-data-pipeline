<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.  Beginning three years
after the effective date of this section, no person shall sell, offer for sale,
or distribute within the State any gas-powered lawn equipment for use or
operation in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Beginning five years after
the effective date of this section, no person shall use or operate gas-powered
lawn equipment in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Any person who violates
the provisions of subsection a. or b. of this section shall be subject to a
civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 for each offense. 
State and local law enforcement shall have exclusive authority to enforce this
section and the penalty imposed shall be collected and enforced by summary
proceedings under the &quot;Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999,&quot; P.L.1999,
c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  If the violation is of a continuing nature, each
day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional,
separate, and distinct offense.  The Superior Court and the municipal court
shall have jurisdiction of proceedings for the enforcement of the penalty
provided by this section.  Any penalty recovered under this section shall be
retained by the enforcing government entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  No later than three years
after the effective date of this section, the Department of Environmental
Protection shall adopt, pursuant to the &quot;Administrative Procedure
Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations,
consistent with federal law, as necessary to implement the requirements of this
section and a finding to determine if an extension of the timeframe of a
prohibition in subsection a. or subsection b. of this section is necessary
pursuant to subsection e. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The Department of
Environmental Protection may extend the timeframe of a prohibition in
subsection a. or b. of this section for an additional period not to exceed one
year upon a finding made pursuant to subsection f. of this section and adopted
pursuant to subsection d. of this section, that it is not cost-effective or
technologically feasible to prohibit the sale or use of gas-powered lawn
equipment within the timeframe required pursuant to this section.  An extension
pursuant to this subsection shall expire after one year unless the Department
of Environmental Protection determines another extension is necessary pursuant
to this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  In determining whether to
extend the timeframe of a prohibition in subsection a. or b. of this section,
the Department of Environmental Protection shall consider the following factors
in determining if the prohibition is cost-effective or technologically
feasible:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) total emissions from
gas-powered lawn equipment within the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) expected timelines for
zero-emission lawn equipment development;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) increased electricity
demand from added charging requirements from zero-emission lawn equipment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) demand and usage of lawn
equipment by both commercial and residential lawn and garden users; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) expected availability and
affordability of zero-emission lawn equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  As used in this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Gas-powered lawn equipment
means lawn equipment that<span style='color:black'> has a two-stroke or
four-stroke engine and uses gasoline or a gasoline and oil blend as fuel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lawn equipment means any
mechanically powered equipment or device that is used for, or intended to be
used for, the mowing of grass, the cutting or chipping of trees, tree roots, or
tree branches, or the clearing of leaves or other vegetation from lawns,
sidewalks, public streets or public highways.  Lawn equipment shall include,
but not be limited to, lawn mowers and lawn mower attachments, lawn edgers,
leaf blowers, leaf vacuums, mulchers, chippers, pruners, trimmers, chainsaws,
power washers, and snow blowers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Zero-emission lawn equipment
means lawn equipment that is powered by a battery, fuel cell, or other means of
energy production that does not result in the emission of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  For privilege periods
beginning on or after January 1 next following the effective date of P.L.     ,
c.     (C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and for the
next five taxable years thereafter, a taxpayer who purchases certain
zero-emission lawn equipment shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed
pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), to be calculated as provided
in subsection b. of this subsection, to compensate the taxpayer for certain
costs incurred in the purchase of the zero-emission lawn equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The amount of credit
allowed to a taxpayer pursuant to this section shall be as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) for the purchase of an

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would prohibit,
beginning three years after the bills effective date, the sale or distribution
of gas-powered lawn equipment within the State for use or operation in New
Jersey.  The bill would also prohibit, beginning five years after the bills
effective date, the use of gas-powered lawn equipment within the State.  The
bill would authorize the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to extend
the timeframe of the prohibitions established by the bill if it finds that
prohibiting the sale or use of the equipment is not cost-effective or
technologically feasible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As defined in the bill, lawn equipment
means any mechanically powered equipment or device that is used for, or
intended to be used for, the mowing of grass, the cutting or chipping of trees,
tree roots, or tree branches, or the clearing of leaves or other vegetation
from lawns, sidewalks, public streets or public highways.  Under the bill,
lawn equipment would include, but not be limited to, lawn mowers and lawn
mower attachments, lawn edgers, leaf blowers, leaf vacuums, mulchers, chippers,
pruners, trimmers, chainsaws, power washers, and snow blowers.  As defined in
the bill, gas-powered lawn equipment means lawn equipment that<span
style='color:black'> has a two-stroke or four-stroke engine and uses gasoline
or a gasoline and oil blend as fuel and </span>zero-emission lawn equipment
means lawn equipment that is powered by a battery, fuel cell, or other means of
energy production that does not result in the emission of carbon dioxide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any person who violates the
bills provisions would be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor
more than $1,000 for each offense.  In the case of a continuing violation, each
day during which the violation continues would constitute an additional,
separate, and distinct offense.  The bill authorizes State and local law
enforcement agencies to have the exclusive authority of enforcing the bills
provisions.  The bill also incentivizes the enforcement of the bills
provisions by permitting any penalty recovered to be retained by the enforcing
government entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would allow the DEP
to extend the timeframe of any prohibitions provided for in the bill for
additional periods not to exceed one year upon a finding, adopted by rule or
regulation, that it is not cost-effective or technologically feasible to
prohibit the sale or use of gas-powered lawn equipment within the timeframe
required pursuant to the bills provisions.  An extension would expire after
one year unless the DEP determines another extension is necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the DEP
to adopt, no later than three years after the bills effective date, rules and
regulations, consistent with federal law, as necessary to implement the bills
provisions.  The bill would require the DEP to consider the following when
determining cost-effectiveness or technological feasibility:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) total emissions from gas-powered
lawn equipment within the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) expected timelines for
zero-emission lawn equipment development;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) increased electricity
demand from added charging requirements from zero-emission lawn equipment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) demand and usage of lawn
equipment by both commercial and residential lawn and garden users; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) expected availability and
affordability of zero-emission lawn equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also provide a tax
credit under the corporation business tax and the gross income tax for certain
costs incurred in the purchase of zero-emission lawn equipment.  The tax credit
would be made available for a period of five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the amount of
credit allowed to a taxpayer pursuant to the bill would be as follows:  (1) for
the purchase of an electric-powered trimmer, pruner, leaf blower, or power
washer, 25 percent of the cost of the zero-emission lawn equipment device or
$50, whichever is less; (2) for the purchase of an electric-powered chainsaw,
25 percent of the cost of the zero-emission lawn equipment device or $100,
whichever is less; and (3) for the purchase of an electric-powered walk behind
lawn mower or snow blower, 25 percent of the cost of the zero-emission lawn
equipment device or $150, whichever is less.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To qualify for a credit under
the bill, a taxpayer would be required to apply to the DEP for a certification
that provides:  (1) that the lawn equipment device purchased by the taxpayer is
a zero-emission lawn equipment device and is eligible for the tax credit; and (2)
the amount of the tax credit.  The bill would require the DEP, in consultation
with the Director of the Division of Taxation, to adopt rules and regulations
as are necessary to implement the bills provisions.  The bill would also limit
the cumulative total of tax credits awarded pursuant to the bill to $500,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would
require, no later than four years after the effective of the tax credits
provided pursuant to the bill, the DEP to prepare and submit to the Governor,
the State Treasurer, and the Legislature a report that, at a minimum,
summarizes the effectiveness of the tax credit in incentivizing the purchase of
zero-emission lawn equipment and provides recommendations for whether or not
the tax credit should be extended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Gas-powered lawn equipment
emits high levels of air pollutants, including but not limited to, carbon
monoxide, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons, unburnt gasoline, and fine particulate
matter.  The emissions from certain gas-powered lawn equipment contribute to
the formation of ozone, smog, and acid rain and can even exceed the emissions
from vehicles used for the same time amount of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to environmental
consequences, gas-powered lawn equipment is also associated with certain
adverse health effects including heart and lung disease.  Certain gas-powered
lawn equipment, including leaf blowers, are also associated with occupational
health concerns.  For example, gas-powered leaf blowers generate noise at a
decibel level capable of causing hearing loss in a short amount of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     There are affordable
alternatives to certain gas-powered lawn <br clear=all style='page-break-before:
always'>
equipment that are less polluting and safer to operate.  Technology is also
advancing to develop zero-emission equivalents to all gas-powered lawn
equipment.  The bills phase-in of its provisions would also provide time for
zero-emission lawn equipment technology to improve prior to the bills
prohibitions on the sale and use of gas-powered lawn equipment taking effect. </p>
