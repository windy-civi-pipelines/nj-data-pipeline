the starting date for the implementation of retail choice as determined by the
board pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-53), the
board shall permit each electric public utility and gas public utility to
recover some or all of the following costs through a societal benefits charge
that shall be collected as a non-bypassable charge imposed on all electric
public utility customers and gas public utility customers, as appropriate:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The costs for the social
programs for which rate recovery was approved by the board prior to April 30,
1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to
section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be
set to recover the same level of social program costs as is being collected in
the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of
P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.). The board may subsequently order, pursuant
to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits
charge to reflect changes in the costs to the utility of administering existing
social programs.  Nothing in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) shall be
construed to abolish or change any social program required by statute <b><span

demand side management regulations prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of

level of demand side management program costs as is being collected in the

c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and every four years thereafter, the board shall
initiate a proceeding and cause to be undertaken a comprehensive resource
analysis of energy programs, and within eight months of initiating such
proceeding and after notice, provision of the opportunity for public comment,
and public hearing, the board, in consultation with the Department of
Environmental Protection, shall determine the appropriate level of funding for
energy efficiency, plug-in electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicle
charging infrastructure, and Class I renewable energy programs that provide
environmental benefits above and beyond those provided by standard offer or
similar programs in effect as of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23
(C.48:3-49 et al.); provided that the funding for such programs be no less than
50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas
public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date
of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) for an initial period of four years from
the issuance of the first comprehensive resource analysis following the
effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and provided that 25
percent of this amount shall be used to provide funding for Class I renewable energy
projects in the State.  In each of the following fifth through eighth years,
the Statewide funding for such programs shall be no less than 50 percent of the
total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates
for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23
(C.48:3-49 et al.), except that as additional funds are made available as a
result of the expiration of past standard offer or similar commitments, the
minimum amount of funding for such programs shall increase by an additional
amount equal to 50 percent of the additional funds made available, until the
minimum amount of funding dedicated to such programs reaches $140,000,000
total.  After the eighth year the board shall make a determination as to the
appropriate level of funding for these programs.  Such programs shall include a
program to provide financial incentives for the installation of Class I
renewable energy projects in the State, and the board, in consultation with the
Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the level and total
amount of such incentives as well as the renewable technologies eligible for
such incentives which shall include, at a minimum, photovoltaic, wind, and fuel
cells. The board shall simultaneously determine, as a result of the
comprehensive resource analysis, the programs to be funded by the societal
benefits charge, the level of cost recovery and performance incentives for old
and new programs and whether the recovery of demand side management programs'
costs currently approved by the board may be reduced or extended over a longer
period of time.  The board shall make these determinations taking into
consideration existing market barriers and environmental benefits, with the
objective of transforming markets, capturing lost opportunities, making energy
services more affordable for low income customers and eliminating subsidies for
programs that can be delivered in the marketplace without electric public
utility and gas public utility customer funding<b><span style='font-family:
