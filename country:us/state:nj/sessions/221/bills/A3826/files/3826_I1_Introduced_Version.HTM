to such petition, to which shall be annexed the oath of allegiance prescribed
in section 41:1-1 of the Revised Statutes duly taken and subscribed by him
before an officer authorized to take oaths in this State, or if the same person
be named for the same office in more than one petition, annexed to one of such
petitions.  Such acceptance shall certify that the candidate is a resident of

made.  <u>Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary,
candidates may also file with such acceptance an attached copy of the sworn
statement required to be filed by candidates with the Election Law Enforcement
Commission pursuant to subsection d. of section 16 of P.L.1973, c.83
(C.19:44A-16).</u>  No candidate so named shall sign such acceptance if he has
signed an acceptance for the primary nomination or any other petition of
nomination under this chapter for such office. In addition, no candidate named
in a petition for the office of member of the House of Representatives shall
sign an acceptance if the candidate has signed an acceptance for the primary

which convicted, the date and place of the conviction and the penalties imposed
for the conviction.  Such a candidate may, as an alternative, submit with the
statement a copy of an official document that provides such information.  If
the candidate has been convicted of more than one criminal offense, such
information about each conviction shall be provided.  Records expunged pursuant
to chapter 52 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes shall not be subject to
disclosure.</p>
