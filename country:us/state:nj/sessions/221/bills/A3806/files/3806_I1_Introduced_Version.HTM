<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  a.  (1)  The court may
order, before trial, the detention of an eligible defendant charged with any
crime, or any offense involving domestic violence as defined in subsection a.
of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19), enumerated in subsection a. of
section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19), if the prosecutor seeks the pretrial
detention of the eligible defendant under section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31
(C.2A:162-19) and after a hearing pursuant to  that section the court finds
clear and convincing evidence that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary
conditions of pretrial release or combination of monetary bail and conditions
would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when
required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community,
and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the
criminal justice process.  The court may also order the pretrial detention of
an eligible defendant when the prosecutor moves for a pretrial detention
hearing and the eligible defendant fails to rebut a presumption of pretrial
detention that may be established for the crimes enumerated under subsection b.
of section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19).</p>

P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-24), when determining whether no amount of monetary

needs of each juvenile participating in the pilot program, a pilot program service

juveniles in the State and preventing the juvenile from engaging or re-engaging
with the criminal justice system:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   In order to increase a
juveniles participation in education, vocational programming, and employment,
a juvenile participating in the pilot program may receive academic support,
depending on personal development goals, and may be connected to secondary
schools, alternative schools, vocational schools, apprenticeship programs and
colleges and universities.  The pilot program service provider may collaborate
with local community college admissions and academic support programs, and offer
workshops that include financial aid planning.  Juveniles participating in the
pilot program who are seeking employment may be linked to vocational or job
readiness training.  The pilot program participants may be trained in and
utilize evidence-based and evidence-informed practices with respect to the
provision of their respective services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In order to increase
participation in mental health and well-being programming, pilot program
service providers may employ trauma-informed practices and connect juveniles
participating in the pilot program to licensed outpatient mental health care
facilities and professionals, and services to address physical health, mental
health and substance use disorders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Pilot program service

and tools to address harmful and unlawful behavior, with a focus on addressing
behavior related to motor vehicle theft crimes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) In order to improve the
behavioral responses of juveniles within communities and deter unlawful
behavior, particularly motor vehicle theft crimes, pilot program service
providers may take steps to increase the program participation rates of
juveniles in other community programs designed to prevent juveniles from
engaging or re-engaging in the criminal justice system.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) Pilot program service providers
may collaborate with the service providers of any education pilot programs
operating in the participating jurisdiction during the time the pilot program
established by this act is operating, in order to incorporate services provided
pursuant to the Grants for Underage Auto-Theft Risk Deterrence Pilot Program
within that education pilot program. </p>

rebuttable presumption of pretrial detention and increases penalties for motor
vehicle theft offenses; authorizes the issuance of an order of home detention
for minors adjudicated delinquent for motor vehicle theft offenses; and makes
any crime of theft of a motor vehicle or receiving a stolen motor vehicle a
crime of the second degree.  In addition, the bill establishes in the Juvenile
Justice Commission (JJC) a two-year pilot program titled the Grants for
Underage Auto-Theft Risk Deterrence Pilot Program, (GUARD) and appropriates $7
million to fund the pilot program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Changes to the Criminal Justice
Reform Law</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under P.L.2014, c.31, also
known as the Criminal Justice Reform Law, (CJR) courts are authorized to
order the pretrial release of a defendant pending further proceedings, or order
the pretrial detention of a defendant who is found to be a flight risk, a
danger to another or the community, or likely to obstruct further criminal
proceedings.  For certain crimes, the CJR establishes a rebuttable presumption that
a defendant is to be detained pending trial because no amount of monetary bail,
non-monetary conditions of release, or combination thereof would reasonably
assure the safety of any other person or the community.  This presumption may
be rebutted by the defendant upon a showing of a preponderance of the
evidence.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This rebuttable presumption
applies under current law when a prosecutor files a motion for the pretrial
detention of a defendant charged with murder or any crime for which the
defendant would be subject to an ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment. 
Under the bill, the rebuttable presumption also would apply when a prosecutor
files a motion for pretrial detention of a defendant charged with theft of a
motor vehicle, receiving a stolen motor vehicle, or the unlawful taking of a
motor vehicle.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law theft of a
motor vehicle is a crime of the third degree unless the value of the vehicle is
$75,000 or more, or the theft involved more than one motor vehicle, in which
case it is a crime of the second degree.  The act of receiving a stolen motor
vehicle under current law also is a crime of the third degree, unless the value
of the vehicle is $75,000 or more.  The bill makes any crime of theft of a
motor vehicle or receiving a stolen motor vehicle a crime of the second
degree.  A crime of the third degree is punishable by three to five years
imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A crime of the second degree
is punishable by five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or
both. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Additional Penalties for Motor
Vehicle Theft Offenses</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of the bill also
provide that, in addition to any other disposition authorized by law, a person
convicted of theft of a motor vehicle, receiving a stolen motor vehicle, or the
unlawful taking of a motor vehicle is to be subject to a penalty and may be
ordered to a period of license suspension or revocation.  For the first
offense, the person is subject to a penalty of $500, and the court may suspend,
revoke, or postpone the person's driving privileges for a up to one year; for a
second offense, the defendant is subject to a penalty of $750, and the court
may suspend, revoke, or postpone the person's driving privileges for up to
exceed two years; and for a third or subsequent offense, the defendant is
subject to a penalty of $1,000, and the court may suspend, revoke, or postpone
the person's driving privileges for up to 10 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of the bill authorize
a court to order the home detention of a minor who is convicted of theft of a
motor vehicle, receiving a stolen motor vehicle, or the unlawful taking of a
motor vehicle.  A minor sentenced to home detention under the bill may leave
the residence to: attend in-person court appearances; attend in-person probation
appointments; attend in-person attorney appointments after providing proper
notice; or for any other reason authorized pursuant to a court order. The bill
requires courts to hear the case of a minor within 48 hours of an arrest for
theft of a motor vehicle theft, receiving a stolen motor vehicle, or the unlawful
taking of a motor vehicle.</p>
