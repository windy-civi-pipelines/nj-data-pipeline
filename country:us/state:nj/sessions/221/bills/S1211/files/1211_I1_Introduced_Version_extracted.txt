Notice of the determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the user fees.  The determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the user fees unless the person against whom it is assessed, within 90 days after the giving of the notice of the determination, shall file a protest in writing as provided in R.S.54:49-18 and request a hearing, or unless the director on the director's own motion shall redetermine the same.  After the hearing the director shall give notice of the determination to the person to whom the user fees are assessed. e.     Any person who shall fail to file a return when due or to pay any user fee when the user fee becomes due, as herein provided, shall be subject to such penalties and interest as may be provided by law.  If the director determines that the failure to comply with any provision of this section was excusable under the circumstances, the director may remit any part of the penalty as shall be appropriate under the circumstances. f.     In addition to the other powers granted by this section, the director may: (1)   Delegate to any officer or employee of the division those powers and duties as the director may deem necessary to carry out efficiently the provisions of this section, and the person or persons to whom the powers have been delegated shall possess and may exercise all of the powers and perform all of the duties delegated by the director; (2)   Prescribe and distribute all necessary forms for the implementation of this section; and (3)   Adopt any rules and regulations necessary for the implementation of this section. g.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subsection (k) of section 4 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-4), if any, to the contrary, any deduction of the user fee imposed pursuant to subsection a. of this section allowed in computing a taxpayer's taxable income which the taxpayer is required to report to the United States Treasury Department for the purpose of computing its federal taxable income shall be allowed in determining the taxpayer's "entire net income" pursuant to subsection (k) of section 4 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-4). h.      Subsections a. through g. of this section shall be without effect on and after the tenth day following a certification by the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury pursuant to subsection b. of section 13 of P.L.2002, c.128 (C.13:1E-223). (cf: P.L.2002, c.128, s.4) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would exempt the holder of a plenary winery license, in most cases, from filing requirements with regard to the user fee imposed on retail sellers of litter-generating products.  Current law exempts from the user fee a retail seller of less than $500,000 in annual retail sales of litter-generating products and requires a return to be filed by retail sellers upon whom the user fee is imposed.  The bill would affirmatively establish the exemption from the return filing requirement for a holder of a plenary winery license who has less than $500,000 in annual retail sales of litter-generating products and who is already exempt from the user fee.
