If an authorized delegate commingles any trust funds with any other funds or property owned or controlled by the authorized delegate, all commingled proceeds and other property shall be impressed with a trust in favor of the licensee in the amount equal to the amount of the proceeds due the licensee. Nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute authority for the creation of any trust funds, or a trust to be impressed for funds, owned by or belonging to the licensee, that have been deposited with a financial institution unless the financial institution has actual knowledge that the funds are owned by or belong to the licensee. The licensee shall be liable to a purchaser or holder of an outstanding payment instrument, which is issued by the licensee or received by the licensees authorized delegate for transmission and set-off by the financial institution. If the licensee has insufficient assets to make the purchaser or holder whole, the purchaser or holder shall be entitled to reimbursement under the surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit or security device possessed by the licensee pursuant to the provisions of sections 6 and 8 of P.L.1998, c.14 (C.17:15C-6 and 17:15C-8) to secure faithful performance of the obligations of the licensee with respect to the receipt, handling, transmission and payment of money in connection with the sale and issuance of payment instruments or transmission of money. g.    An authorized delegate shall report to the licensee the theft or loss of payment instruments within 24 hours from the time it knew or should have known of that theft or loss. h.    Authorized delegates shall comply with the provisions of [31 C.F.R. s.103.11 et seq.] 31 C.F.R. s.1010.100 et seq. and P.L.1994, c.121 (C.2C:21-23 et seq.). i.     Authorized delegates shall conduct all business governed by this act in the name of the licensee. j.     An authorized delegate shall prominently display at each of its locations a notice in a form prescribed by the commissioner, indicating that the authorized delegate is an authorized delegate of a licensee under P.L.1998, c.14 (C.17:15C-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.1998, c.14, s.18) 8.    Section 24 of P.L.1998, c.14 (C.17:15C-24) is amended to read as follows: 24.  a.  Any person who knowingly and willfully violates any provision of this act for which a penalty is not specifically provided is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. b.    Any person who knowingly and willfully makes a material, false statement in any document filed or required to be filed under this act with the intent to deceive the recipient of the document is guilty of a crime of the third degree. c.     Any person who knowingly and willfully engages in the business of money transmission without a license as provided herein shall be guilty of a crime of the [third] second degree. d.    Any person who purposely or knowingly refuses to permit any lawful investigation by the commissioner or the Attorney General shall be guilty of a crime of the third degree. (cf: P.L.1998, c.14, s.24) 9.    This act shall take effect on the 180th day following enactment. STATEMENT This bill makes various revisions to the New Jersey Money Transmitters Act to require licensed money transmitters and their delegates to provide more reporting, record keeping and consumer disclosures. The bill requires licensees to prominently display license information at their locations. The bill broadens the consent deemed to be given by licensees and delegates to include record inspection rights for appropriate law enforcement representatives in addition to the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, and requires licensees to keep records for five years instead of the three years required by the current act. The bill requires licensees to file quarterly reports with the commissioner, in addition to the annual reports presently required, and raises the penalty to $200 per day, from not more than $100 per day, as to any licensee who fails to file any report. The licensee shall also file annually with the commissioner, a copy of the licensee's most recent registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money transmitter business pursuant to 31 C.F.R. s.1010.100 et seq. The bill expands the liability of licensees for certain acts of their delegates and provides for license suspension upon conviction for certain crimes. The bill also requires a delegate to prominently display at each of its locations a notice indicating that the delegate is an authorized delegate of a licensee. Further, the bill mandates that the department maintain a website to make licensee and delegate information available to the public. Finally, the bill increases the crime of operating as a money transmitter without a license from a crime of the third degree to a crime of the second degree. This bill provides that funds belonging to a licensee and deposited in a financial institution shall not constitute trust funds, unless the financial institution has actual knowledge that such funds are owned by or belong to the licensee. The bill also provides that the licensee is liable to a purchaser or holder of an outstanding payment instrument which is issued by the licensee or received by the licensees authorized delegate for transmission and set-off by the financial institution. If the licensee has insufficient assets to make the purchaser or holder whole, the purchaser or holder will be entitled to reimbursement under the surety bond that the act currently requires all licensees to have. The bill also makes technical corrections.

If an authorized delegate commingles any trust funds with any other funds or property owned or controlled by the authorized delegate, all commingled proceeds and other property shall be impressed with a trust in favor of the licensee in the amount equal to the amount of the proceeds due the licensee. Nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute authority for the creation of any trust funds, or a trust to be impressed for funds, owned by or belonging to the licensee, that have been deposited with a financial institution unless the financial institution has actual knowledge that the funds are owned by or belong to the licensee. The licensee shall be liable to a purchaser or holder of an outstanding payment instrument, which is issued by the licensee or received by the licensees authorized delegate for transmission and set-off by the financial institution.

STATEMENT This bill makes various revisions to the New Jersey Money Transmitters Act to require licensed money transmitters and their delegates to provide more reporting, record keeping and consumer disclosures. The bill requires licensees to prominently display license information at their locations. The bill broadens the consent deemed to be given by licensees and delegates to include record inspection rights for appropriate law enforcement representatives in addition to the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, and requires licensees to keep records for five years instead of the three years required by the current act. The bill requires licensees to file quarterly reports with the commissioner, in addition to the annual reports presently required, and raises the penalty to $200 per day, from not more than $100 per day, as to any licensee who fails to file any report. The licensee shall also file annually with the commissioner, a copy of the licensee's most recent registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money transmitter business pursuant to 31 C.F.R. s.1010.100 et seq. The bill expands the liability of licensees for certain acts of their delegates and provides for license suspension upon conviction for certain crimes. The bill also requires a delegate to prominently display at each of its locations a notice indicating that the delegate is an authorized delegate of a licensee. Further, the bill mandates that the department maintain a website to make licensee and delegate information available to the public. Finally, the bill increases the crime of operating as a money transmitter without a license from a crime of the third degree to a crime of the second degree. This bill provides that funds belonging to a licensee and deposited in a financial institution shall not constitute trust funds, unless the financial institution has actual knowledge that such funds are owned by or belong to the licensee. The bill also provides that the licensee is liable to a purchaser or holder of an outstanding payment instrument which is issued by the licensee or received by the licensees authorized delegate for transmission and set-off by the financial institution. If the licensee has insufficient assets to make the purchaser or holder whole, the purchaser or holder will be entitled to reimbursement under the surety bond that the act currently requires all licensees to have. The bill also makes technical corrections.
