amending P.L.1999, c.152 and P.L.2016, c.12.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. (New section) a.  As used
in this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Appurtenant
woodland&quot; means a woodland which is contiguous and beneficial to a tract
of land devoted to agricultural, silvicultural, or horticultural use and
production, including by providing a windbreak or watershed, or by buffering or
controlling soil erosion .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Local government
unit&quot; means the same as that term is defined in section 3 of P.L.1999,
c.152 (C.13:8C-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Qualifying tax exempt
nonprofit organization&quot; means the same as that term is defined in section
3 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Woodland&quot; means a
defined and continuous area of land that lies wholly within a property and has
at least 10 percent canopy cover.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The State Agriculture
Development Committee shall establish a program for the acquisition, by a local
government unit or qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization, of a development
easement restricting, in perpetuity, the development of a privately-owned
woodland.  The purpose of the program shall be the preservation and stewardship
of lands for agricultural, silvicultural, or horticultural use and production.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  In order to be eligible
for the acquisition of development rights under the program, a woodland shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) be at least five acres in
size;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) be devoted to the
production for sale of tree or forest products, other than Christmas trees, or
be appurtenant woodlands to land so devoted;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) be managed by the
landowner in accordance with a forest stewardship plan approved pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.2009, c.256 (C.13:1L-31), a woodland management plan approved
pursuant to section 3 of the &quot;Farmland Assessment Act of 1964,&quot;
P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.3), or a plan approved pursuant to the federal Forest
Stewardship Program administered by the United States Forest Service;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) not be a property targeted
for acquisition or preservation by the Department of Environmental Protection
or the Garden State Preservation Trust, as certified by the Commissioner of
Environmental Protection or the commissioner's designee.  The commissioner or
the designee shall have 30 days to respond to a request by the committee, a
local government unit, or a qualified nonprofit organization for such a
certification.  If the commissioner or the designee does not respond after 30
days, the property shall deemed to be not targeted for acquisition or
preservation by the Environmental Protection or the Garden State Preservation
Trust, and thus shall be eligible for the acquisition of development rights
under the program established by this section;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) be supportive of, or
include, an existing parcel of farmland; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) be located in an
agricultural development area designated pursuant to the provisions of
P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-11 et al.). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  The appraisal process for
development easements under the program shall be the same as that for farmland
under the provisions of subsection e. of section 8 of P.L.2016, c.12
(C.13:8C-50).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The State Agriculture
Development Committee shall use moneys in the &quot;Preserve New Jersey
Farmland Preservation Fund.&quot; as allocated pursuant to subsubparagraph (ii)
of subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 8 of P.L.2016,
c.12 (C.13:8C-50) and section 37 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-37), to provide
grants to local government units and qualifying tax exempt nonprofit
organizations to fund the acquisition of development easements under the
program established pursuant to this section.  The use of such funds shall be
consistent with the provisions of the &quot;Preserve New Jersey Act,&quot;
P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) and the State Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  The State Agriculture
Development Committee shall coordinate with the United States Forest Service
and any other applicable State or federal agency, in order to to pursue any
federal, State, local, and private funding, in addition to the funding annually
allocated pursuant to subsection e. of this section, which may be available to
fund the program established pursuant to this section, including funding made
available through the federal &quot;Forest Legacy Program,&quot; administered
by the United States Forest Service, and through the federal &quot;Health
Forests Reserve Program,&quot; administered by the United States Natural
Resources Conservation Service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    No later than one year
after the effective date of this section, the State Agriculture Development
Committee shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the
&quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.),
for the establishment and implementation of the program required by this
section, including, but not limited to application procedures and criteria and
policies for the evaluation and priority ranking of projects.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    (1) Any development
easement permanently restricting, in perpetuity, development on privately-owned

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill directs the State
Agriculture Development Committee (SADC) to establish a program to provide
grants to local government units and qualifying tax exempt nonprofit
organizations for the acquisition of development easements on privately-owned
woodlands.  The purpose of the program would be the preservation and
stewardship of lands for agricultural, silvicultural, or horticultural use and
production.  The use of such funding, for the bills purposes, is to be
consistent with the provisions of the &quot;Preserve New Jersey Act,&quot;
P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) and the State Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to be eligible for inclusion
in the new development easement program established pursuant to the bill, a woodland
would be required to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) be at least five acres in
size;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) be devoted to the
production for sale of tree or forest products, other than Christmas trees, or
be appurtenant woodlands to land so devoted;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) be managed by the
landowner in accordance with a forest stewardship plan approved pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.2009, c.256 (C.13:1L-31), a woodland management plan approved
pursuant to section 3 of the &quot;Farmland Assessment Act of 1964,&quot;
P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.3), or a plan approved pursuant to the federal Forest
Stewardship Program administered by the United States Forest Service;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) not be a property targeted
for acquisition or preservation by the Department of Environmental Protection
or the Garden State Preservation Trust, as certified by the Commissioner of
Environmental Protection or the commissioner's designee;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) be supportive of, or
include, an existing parcel of farmland; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) be located in an
agricultural development area designated pursuant to the provisions of
P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-11 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The appraisal process for
development easements under the program would be the same as that for farmland
under the provisions of subsection e. of section 8 of P.L.2016, c.12
(C.13:8C-50), which were recently revised by P.L.2023, c.245.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the program, the SADC would
use constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues in order
to provide grants to local government units and qualifying tax exempt nonprofit
organizations to fund the acquisition of development easements.  The bill would
stipulate that up to 15 percent of the annual appropriations of moneys from the
&quot;Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund&quot; by the SADC could be
used for the program.  The grants distributed by the SADC would be authorized
to cover up to 80 percent of the costs of acquisition of a development easement
by a local government unit, and up to 50 percent of the costs of acquisition of
a development easement by a nonprofit organization.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also require
that those moneys in the &quot;Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation
Fund&quot; that are used to provide grants to local government units and
nonprofit organizations to acquire development easements on farmland and
woodlands be awarded on the condition that grant awardees will expend the funds
with first priority given to the preservation of farmland, second priority
given to the preservation of farmland with appurtenant woodlands, and third priority
given to the preservation of woodlands that are supportive of, or include,
existing farmland under the program established pursuant to this bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the intent of the bill's
sponsor to establish a program that is different from the Green Acres program
administered by the Department of Environmental Protection in the following
ways.  First, properties in the program would remain in private hands. 
Although the Green Acres program has the ability to obtain development
easements, rather than acquiring land outright, it has in recent years chosen
to focus exclusively on land acquisition.  This program, by contrast, would not
involve the acquisition of land by the State.  Secondly, properties that
participate in this program would remain subject to property taxes, thus not
depriving municipalities of needed revenue.  Third, the bill would allow for
small properties to participate in the program, as opposed to the larger
properties that are prioritized by the Green Acres program.  Fourth, this
program would encourage the effective protection and management of woodlands by
the property owners themselves, who are in the best position to do so.  Finally,
the program would allow small farms with large tracts of supportive woodlands,
which may not qualify for preservation under current farmland preservation
program rules, to qualify for funding.</p>
