The materials shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   a standardized letter for public service employers to distribute to their employees that briefly summarizes the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, provides information about what eligible employees are required to do in order to benefit from the program, and recommends that eligible employees contact their student loan servicer for additional resources; (2)   a detailed fact sheet describing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, including the official website addresses maintained by the United State Department of Education for the program and by the United States Department of the Treasury for student loan borrower resources; and (3)   a document containing frequently asked questions about the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. b.    The secretary shall coordinate with other State departments, agencies, and offices as necessary to make the materials available to public service employers as that term is defined in section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     Each public service employer shall annually provide to all employees the most recent available version of the materials required pursuant to subsection a. of this section in written or electronic form.
