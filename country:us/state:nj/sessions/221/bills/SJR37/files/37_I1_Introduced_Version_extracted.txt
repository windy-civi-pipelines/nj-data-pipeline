STATEMENT This joint resolution designates the month of October of each year as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Awareness Month. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, commonly known as SIDS, occurs when an infant under the age of one dies of unexplained causes while sleeping.  SIDS is one of a number of infant death classifications that contribute to the infant mortality rate.  While the United States and New Jersey have seen a decline in the overall infant mortality rate since the early 1990s, SIDS remains the fourth leading cause of death in infants under the age of one in the United States as of 2017.  Furthermore, racial disparities continue to persist in both the occurrence of SIDS and the overall infant mortality rate, with infants born to African-American and Native American or Alaska Native women experiencing the highest rate of SIDS and infant mortality as of 2017. As information and research become available, it is important to ensure that the public is informed on both the causes of SIDS and best practices for preventing SIDS in an effort to reduce the number of infants who die as a result of SIDS.
