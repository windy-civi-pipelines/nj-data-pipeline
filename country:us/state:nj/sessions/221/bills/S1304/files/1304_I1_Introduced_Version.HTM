The bureau may also disclose that information: (1)   in court proceedings; (2)   if ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction; or (3)   if appropriate, in furtherance of any ongoing investigation or proceeding.  The bureau chief may also request and use private investigative materials provided to it by other federal and state authorities, including authorities of other states and foreign countries. c.     In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena or order issued to, any person, the Superior Court, upon application by the bureau chief, may issue to the person an order requiring the person to appear before the bureau chief, or the officer designated by the bureau chief, there to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence touching the matter under investigation or in question.  The court may grant injunctive relief restraining engaging in any digital asset business activity, or holding itself out as being able to engage in any digital asset business activity by a person, licensee, controlling person, responsible individual, key individual, or agent of a licensee until such person has fully complied with such subpoena or order and the bureau has completed its investigation.  The court may proceed in the action in a summary manner or otherwise. d.    No person is excused from attending and testifying or from producing any document or record before the bureau or in obedience to the subpoena or order of the bureau chief or any officer designated by the bureau chief, or  in any proceeding instituted by the bureau, on the ground that the testimony or evidence (documentary or otherwise) required of the person may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture; but the testimony or evidence (documentary or otherwise) compelled from an individual who has claimed their privilege against self-incrimination, or the fruits thereof, shall not be used to prosecute that individual or to subject that individual to any penalty or forfeiture, except that the individual testifying is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury, false swearing or contempt committed in testifying. e.     When it appears to the bureau chief that the testimony of any person is essential to an investigation instituted by the bureau chief as provided by P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and that the failure of such person to appear and testify may defeat the proper and effective conduct thereof, the bureau chief, in addition to the other remedies provided for herein, may, by petition verified generally, setting forth the facts, apply to the Superior Court for a writ of ne exeat against such person.  The court shall thereupon direct the issuance of the writ against such person requiring the person to give sufficient bail conditioned to insure the persons appearance before the bureau chief for examination under oath in such investigation and that the person will continue their appearance therein from time to time until the completion of the investigation and will appear before the court if the bureau chief shall institute any proceeding therein as a result of the bureau chiefs investigation. The court shall cause to be indorsed on the writ of ne exeat, in words at length, a suitable amount of bail upon which the person named in the writ shall be freed, having a due regard to the nature of the case and the value of the digital assets involved.  All applications to be freed on bail shall be on notice to the bureau chief and the sufficiency of the bail given on the writ shall be approved by the court.  All recognizances shall be to the State and all forfeitures thereof shall be declared by the court. The proceeds of the forfeitures shall be paid into the State treasury. 12. Restraints ordered by bureau chief. a. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena or order issued to, any person, the bureau chief may, in the bureau chiefs discretion, summarily order restraints on engaging in any digital asset business activity, or holding itself out as being able to engage in any digital asset business activity by a person, licensee, controlling person, responsible individual, key individual, or agent of a licensee, until that person has fully complied with that subpoena or order and the bureau has completed its investigation.  The bureau chief may proceed in an action in a summary manner or otherwise, by issuing a cease and desist order, by denying, revoking or suspending any license under P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), by assessing civil monetary penalties, or by any combination of these actions the bureau chief deems appropriate.  Upon entry of such an order, the bureau chief shall promptly notify each person subject thereto that it has been entered and of the reasons therefor. b.   The bureau chief shall entertain on no less than three days' notice an application to lift the summary order on written application of the person subject thereto and in connection therewith may, but need not, hold a hearing and hear testimony, but shall provide to the person subject thereto a written statement of the reasons for the summary order. c.   Upon service of notice of the order issued by the bureau chief, each person subject thereto shall have up to 15 days to respond to the bureau in the form of a written answer and written request for a hearing.  The bureau chief shall, within five days of receiving the answer and request for a hearing, either transmit the matter to the Office of Administrative Law for a hearing, or schedule a hearing at the Bureau of Securities.  Orders issued pursuant to this section shall be subject to an application to vacate upon 10 days' notice, and in any event a preliminary hearing on the order shall be held within 20 days after it is requested, and the filing of a motion to vacate the order shall toll the time for filing an answer and written request for a hearing. d.   If a person subject to the order fails to respond by either filing a written answer and written request for a hearing with the bureau or moving to vacate the order within the 15-day prescribed period, that person shall have waived the opportunity to be heard and the order shall remain in effect as to that person until modified or vacated by the bureau chief. 13. a.

(C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including any applicant, key individual, responsible individual, controlling person, or person over whom the applicant has control, to participate in a multistate licensing system, including, if so designated, the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System. c.   The bureau is authorized to waive or modify, in whole or in part, by rule, regulation, or order, any requirement set forth in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and to establish new requirements, as reasonably necessary for the purpose of participation in the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System or similar system or entity including: payment of nonrefundable fees to apply for, maintain, and renew licenses through the system; renewal or reporting dates; procedures for amending or surrendering a license; and requirements pertaining to any other activity necessary for participation in the system. 14.  There is established in the Division of Consumer Affairs  in the Department of Law and Public Safety the Digital Asset Enforcement Fund, which shall continue as a dedicated, nonlapsing, revolving fund.  All fees, penalties, costs, fines and other moneys collected pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall be deposited in the fund.  Moneys in the fund shall be appropriated for use by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs to administer and enforce the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and to conduct any investigations related thereto.  There shall be made available from the General Fund such additional amounts as may be required to carry out the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 15. a.  The bureau may adopt, amend, or rescind any guidance, guidelines, forms and orders and, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), any rules and regulations as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including those governing applications, forms,  and reports, and defining any terms, whether or not used in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), insofar as the definitions are not inconsistent with the provisions of P.L. , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.   The bureau may prescribe the form, manner, and medium in which any application, form, report, statement, or any other document shall be prepared, including whether in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or practices. c.     The bureau may set fees by order, which shall remain in effect until applicable rules and regulations are promulgated. 16. P.L.    , c.

This act shall take effect immediately, except that section 3 shall take effect on the first day of the 25th month next following enactment, but the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs and the bureau chief may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill, the Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Act, regulates digital asset business activity.  The bill defines digital asset to mean a representation of economic, proprietary, or access rights that is stored in a machine-readable format and has a transaction history that is recorded in a distributed, digital ledger or digital data structure in which consensus is achieved through a mechanism consistent with the underlying protocol.  Examples of digital assets include, but are not limited to, digital consumer assets, digital securities, and virtual currency.  Digital asset does not include securities, whether in digital form or otherwise, as defined pursuant to law. The bill provides that a person is not to engage in a digital asset business activity, or hold themselves out as being able to engage in a digital asset business activity, unless the person is licensed in this State by the New Jersey Bureau of Securities (bureau), or has filed a pending license with the bureau. The bill provides the bureau may license a person to carry on one or more digital asset business activities described in the bill.  The bureau shall have the authority to exempt persons from the provisions of the bill concerning engaging in digital asset business activity without a license and to determine whether a person is subject to a license pursuant to the bill. The bill provides that a person who violates the provisions requiring licensure is liable for a penalty of $500 per day, from the first day the bureau issues a notice of failure to apply for a license until a license application is filed with the bureau. The bill provides that an application for a license is to be submitted in a form and manner set forth by the bureau. Each application is to be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee. Applicants are to provide certain information relevant to the applicants proposed digital asset business activity.  Certain information provided to the bureau pursuant to an application for a license is to be protected from public disclosure.  The bill requires applicants to provide a list of any litigation, arbitration, or administrative proceedings to which the applicant, or certain other individuals, has been a party to for 10 years prior to submission of the application.  This bill also permits the bureau to use the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System, or a similar system, to conduct criminal history records checks or applicants and certain other individuals. The bill requires the bureau to grant or deny any digital asset business license application within 180 days of receipt of a completed application.  The bureau may refuse an application for a digital asset business license application if a licensee or applicant fails to meet certain standards specified in the bill. Licensees are required to submit a renewal of a license that contains an update of all information required at initial licensing as well as certain other information described in the bill. The bill provides that the bureau may audit any digital asset business licensee. The bill stipulates that each licensee is to maintain and enforce confidential, written compliance policies which are to be reviewed and approved by the licensees board of directors or an equivalent governing body. The bureau may suspend or revoke a digital asset business license upon certain findings that are provided in the bill. The bill provides the bureau chief with the authority to, for good cause shown, summarily suspend, revoke, or deny any license pending final determination of a proceeding.  Under the bill, notice of any suspension or revocation of a license issued by the bureau is to prominently indicate that a right to a hearing is available. A licensee, under the bill, is to provide the bureau with any document relating to the operations of the licensee upon receiving written notice from the bureau. The licensee is to maintain records of all client transactions and any accounts, correspondences, memoranda, and other records as the bureau may require, for no less than six years from the date of a transactions occurrence, unless the bureau by rule prescribes another timeframe.  The bureau has the authority to conduct examinations to determine a licensees compliance with the provisions of the bill. The bill requires the terms and conditions of a digital asset business involving a customers account to be disclosed at the time the customer contracts for a digital asset business service.  The disclosure is to be full and complete, contain no material misrepresentations, be in readily understandable language and may include, as appropriate and to the extent applicable, certain information concerning fees and charges, risks to the customer, and any protections or securities that are in place. The disclosures required by the bill are to be displayed and individually agreed to by a customer before any digital asset transaction at an electronic kiosk.  Any fee to be charged is required to be displayed and individually agreed to by a customer before any digital asset transaction or digital asset balance inquiry at an electronic kiosk. Under the bill, it is a violation for any person to make or cause to be made, in any document filed with the bureau or in any proceeding, investigation or examination conducted under the bill, any statement which is, at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made, false or misleading in any material respect.  In addition, the bill provides the bureau chief with certain investigatory authority to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of the bill or to otherwise aid in the enforcement of the bill.  The bill makes it unlawful for any officer or employee of the bureau to use for personal benefit any information which is filed with or obtained by the bureau that is not made public. Lastly, the bill establishes the Digital Asset Enforcement Fund in the Division of Consumer Affairs (division) of the Department of Law and Public Safety is to continue as a dedicated, nonlapsing, revolving fund. All fees, penalties, costs, fines, and other collected moneys are to be deposited in the fund and used by the director of the division to administer and enforce the provisions of the bill, and to conduct investigations related to the bill.
