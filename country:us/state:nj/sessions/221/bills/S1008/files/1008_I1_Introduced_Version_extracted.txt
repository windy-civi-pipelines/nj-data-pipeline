(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 5.    Each entity conducting an audit shall establish an internal appeals process under which a pharmacy shall have at least 30 days from the delivery of the preliminary audit report to appeal an unfavorable preliminary audit report to the entity. If, following the appeal, the entity finds that an unfavorable audit report or any portion thereof is unsubstantiated, the entity shall dismiss the audit report or  portion thereof without any further proceedings. 6.    A plan sponsor may request, and an entity conducting an audit shall provide, a copy of the final audit report, after completion of any review process, to the plan sponsor at its request. 7.    The provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not apply to: a. any investigative audit commenced based upon an articulable suspicion of fraud, willful misrepresentation, or abuse, including investigative audits pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-7), section 8 of P.L.1983, c.320 (C.17:33A-8), section 71 of P.L.2003, c.89 (C.2C:21-4.4), or any other statutory provision providing for an investigation relating to insurance fraud; or b. audits conducted by the Department of Human Services pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-7), provided, however, that the provisions of chapter 49 under Title 10 of the New Jersey Administrative Code shall apply to audits conducted by the Department of Health under section 7 of P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-7). 8.    An entity conducting an audit pursuant to the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not compensate the agent or employee conducting the audit based on percentage of the amount recovered by the audit. 9.    The Commissioner of Banking and Insurance shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).

Under the bill, the audits are to be conducted in accordance with certain requirements concerning the scope of an audit, procedures to properly perform an audit, record-keeping, and recoupment. Additionally, the entity conducting an audit shall not use the accounting practice of extrapolation in calculating recoupments or penalties for audits. Under the bill, recoupments of any disputed funds are to only occur after final internal disposition of the audit, including the appeals process as set forth in the bill. Each entity conducting an audit shall establish an internal appeals process under which a pharmacy shall have at least 30 days from the delivery of the preliminary audit report to appeal an unfavorable preliminary audit report to the entity. If, following the appeal, the entity finds that an unfavorable audit report or any portion thereof is unsubstantiated, the entity is to dismiss the audit report or portion thereof without the necessity of any further proceedings. Each entity conducting an audit is to provide a copy of the final audit report, after completion of any review process, to the plan sponsor at its request or in an alternate format. The provisions of the bill do not apply to any investigative audit commenced based upon an articulable suspicion of fraud, willful misrepresentation, or abuse, including without limitation investigative audits under the New Jersey Medical Assistance and Health Services Act; the New Jersey Insurance Fraud Prevention Act; the New Jersey criminal statute establishing insurance fraud as a crime; or any other statutory provision which authorizes investigations relating to insurance fraud. Additionally the Department of Human Services is exempt from the bills provisions when conducting audits under the New Jersey Medical Assistance and Health Services Act, so long as the regulations establishing an appeals process for Medicaid providers apply to the parties under audit by the Department of Human Services pursuant to the New Jersey Medical Assistance and Health Services Act. Under the bill, an entity conducting the audit may not pay the agent or employee who is conducting the audit based on percentage of the amount recovered. Lastly, the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance is assigned the enforcement of the bills provisions and is to promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate its provisions. The Commissioner has the authority to investigate complaints of alleged violations of this section; to prohibit recoupment; to order reimbursement of any wrongful recoupment; to institute fines for violations of the law, rules, or regulations; and to take any other actions pursuant to any authority granted pursuant to current law relating to the regulation and licensure of pharmacy benefit managers.
