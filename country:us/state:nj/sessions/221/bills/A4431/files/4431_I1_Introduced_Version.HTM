c.83 (C.19:44A-8) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8. a. (1) Each political
committee shall make a full cumulative report, upon a form prescribed by the
Election Law Enforcement Commission, of all contributions in excess of $200 in
the form of moneys, loans, paid personal services, or other things of value
made to it and all expenditures made, incurred, or authorized by it in
furtherance of the nomination, election, or defeat of any candidate, or in aid

on any candidate or public question, during the period ending 48 hours
preceding the date of the report and beginning on the date on which the first
of those contributions was received or the first of those expenditures was
made, whichever occurred first.  The cumulative report, except as hereinafter
provided, shall contain the name and mailing address of each person or group
from whom moneys, loans, paid personal services or other things of value in
excess of $200 have been contributed since 48 hours preceding the date on which
the previous such report was made and the amount contributed by each person or
group, and where the contributor is an individual, the report shall indicate
the occupation of the individual and the name and mailing address of the
individual's employer.  In the case of any loan reported pursuant to this
subsection, the report shall contain the name and mailing address of each
person who has cosigned such loan since 48 hours preceding the date on which
the previous such report was made, and where an individual has cosigned such
loans, the report shall indicate the occupation of the individual and the name

also contain the name and address of each person, firm or organization to whom
expenditures have been paid since 48 hours preceding the date on which the
previous such report was made and the amount and purpose of each such
expenditure.  The cumulative report shall be filed with the Election Law Enforcement
Commission on the dates designated in section 16 hereof.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The campaign treasurer of the
political committee reporting shall certify to the correctness of each report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each campaign treasurer of a
political committee shall file written notice with the commission of a
contribution in excess of $200 received during the period between the 13th day
prior to the election and the date of the election, and of an expenditure of
money or other thing of value in excess of $200 made, incurred or authorized by
the political committee to support or defeat a candidate in an election, or to
aid the passage or defeat of any public question, during the period between the
13th day prior to the election and the date of the election.  The notice of a
contribution shall be filed in writing or by electronic transmission within 72
hours of the receipt of the contribution when the contribution is received
between the 13th day and the eighth day prior to the election, or within 24
hours of the receipt of the contribution when the contribution is received
between the seventh day prior to the election and the date of the election. 
The notice shall set forth the amount and date of the contribution, the name
and mailing address of the contributor, and where the contributor is an individual,
the individual's occupation and the name and mailing address of the

or an individual seeking party office makes or authorizes an expenditure on
behalf of a candidate, it shall provide immediate written notification to the
candidate of the expenditure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) A group of two or more
persons acting jointly, or any corporation, partnership, or any other
incorporated or unincorporated association including a political club,
political action committee, civic association or other organization, which in
any calendar year contributes or expects to contribute at least $2,500.00 to
the aid or promotion of the candidacy of an individual, or of the candidacies
of individuals, for elective public office or the passage or defeat of a public
question or public questions and which expects to make contributions toward
such aid or promotion, or toward such passage or defeat, during a subsequent
election shall certify that fact to the commission, and the commission, upon
receiving that certification and on the basis of any information as it may
require of the group, corporation, partnership, association or other organization,
shall determine whether the group, corporation, partnership, association or
other organization is a continuing political committee for the purposes of this
act.  If the commission determines that the group, corporation, partnership,
association or other organization is a continuing political committee, it shall
so notify that continuing political committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires enhanced
reporting by independent expenditure committees, extends the statute of
limitations for campaign finance violations, and exempts reports of
contributions and expenditures required to be filed with the Election Law
Enforcement Commission (ELEC) from certain redaction and nondisclosure requirements.
This bill would enact the three recommendations made by ELEC in its 2023 annual
report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Enhanced Reporting by
Independent Expenditure Committees</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires independent
expenditure committees, the so-called dark money groups, to promptly report
campaign contributions and expenditures in the days before an election. This
bill also requires such committees to file post-election quarterly reports
until the closure of their campaign depository accounts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, independent
expenditure committees are required to file with the Election Law Enforcement
Commission (ELEC) a cumulative report on the 11th day preceding the primary
election, and on the 20th day following the primary election, of all
contributions received in excess of $7,500 in the form of moneys, loans, paid
personal services, or other things of value made to it for the purpose of
furthering the independent expenditure. They are also required to report all
independent expenditures made, incurred, or authorized by it. In addition, each
independent expenditure committee making an electioneering communication
pertaining to a municipal, runoff, school board, special, or general election
is required to file with ELEC a cumulative report on the 29th day preceding the
election, a report on the 11th day preceding the election, and on the 20th day
following the election, of all contributions received in excess of $7,500 in
the form of moneys, loans, paid personal services, or other things of value
made to it for the purpose of furthering the independent expenditure, and of
all independent expenditures made, incurred, or authorized by it. The reporting
period begins on the first day of the preceding calendar year and ends on the
reporting date. However, under current law, independent expenditure committees
are not required to report contributions received and expenditures made in the
period between the filing of the 11th-day pre-election report and the day of
the election, thereby creating a transparency loophole.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, when an
independent expenditure committee receives a contribution from a single source
of more than $7,500 after the final day of a cumulative reporting period and on
or before a primary, municipal, runoff, school board, special, or general
election which occurs after that final day but prior to the final day of the
next reporting period it will be required, in writing or by electronic
transmission, to report that contribution to ELEC within 72 hours of receiving
it, if that contribution is received between the 15th day prior to that
election and the day of the election. However, a contribution received between
the seventh day prior to that election and the day of the election would be
required to be reported within 24 hours of receiving it. The bill requires the
committee to report the amount and date of the contribution; the name and
mailing address of the contributor; and where the contributor is an individual,
the individuals occupation and the name and mailing address of the individuals
employer.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, when an
independent expenditure committee makes or authorizes any independent
expenditure of more than $200, or incurs any obligation therefor, between the
15th day prior to the day of a primary, municipal, runoff, school board,
special, or general election and the day of that election, it will be required
to report, in writing or by electronic transmission, that independent
expenditure to the commission within 72 hours of making, authorizing, or
incurring it. However, an independent expenditure made, authorized, or incurred
between the seventh day prior to the election and the day of the election would
be required to be reported within 24 hours of making, authorizing, or incurring
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, independent
expenditure committees do not have to file post-election quarterly reports.
This bill would require each independent expenditure committee required to file
reports to also file with the Election Law Enforcement Commission, following
each election but not later than April 15, July 15, October 15 and January 15
of each calendar year, a cumulative quarterly report of all moneys, loans, paid
personal services or other things of value in excess of $7,500 contributed to
it during the period ending on the 15th day preceding that date and commencing
on January 1 of that calendar year or, in the case of the cumulative quarterly
report to be filed not later than January 15, of the previous calendar year,
and all expenditures made, incurred, or authorized by it during the period. The
cumulative quarterly report would contain the name and mailing address of each
person or group from whom moneys, loans, paid personal services or other things
of value in excess of $7,500 have been contributed and the amount contributed
by each person or group, and where an individual has made such contributions,
the report would indicate the occupation of the individual and the name and mailing
address of the individuals employer.  In the case of any loan reported, the
report would contain the name and address of each person who cosigns such loan,
and where an individual has cosigned such loans, the report would indicate the
occupation of the individual and the name and mailing address of the
individuals employer. The report would also contain the name and address of
each person, firm or organization to whom expenditures have been paid and the
amount and purpose of each such expenditure. The treasurer of the independent
expenditure committee reporting would certify to the correctness of each
cumulative quarterly report. Each independent expenditure committee would continue
to file the post-election quarterly reports until the closure of the
committees campaign depository account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Statute of Limitations for
Violations</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill extends the statute of
limitations for campaign finance violations. Under current law, any enforcement
action brought by ELEC for any violations of campaign finance laws is subject to
a statute of limitations of two years following the occurrence of the alleged
violation. Under this bill, the statute of limitations would be four years
following the date of the election for which the alleged violation occurred.
The new four-year statute of limitations will apply to any violations that take
place after the enactment of this bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Exemption from Redaction and
Nondisclosure</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill exempts reports
filed with ELEC from certain document redaction and nondisclosure requirements.
Under current law, certain public officials and employees, such as judges and
law enforcement officers, are entitled to have their personal information
redacted or subject to nondisclosure when such information is present on a
public record. However, there are certain exceptions when an individuals
personal information may still be disclosed, even if they are otherwise
entitled to redaction or nondisclosure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would add reports
required to be filed with ELEC regarding election-related financing to the list
of current exceptions.  This exception would apply to all reports filed by any
individual, candidate, campaign, committee, or other entity under The New
Jersey Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act. </p>
