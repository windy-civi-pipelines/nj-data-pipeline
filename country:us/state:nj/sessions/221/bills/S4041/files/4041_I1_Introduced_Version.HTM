<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It

the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A taxpayer shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.
162 (C.54:10A-5) in an amount equal to 15 percent of the wages paid by the
taxpayer during the privilege period to qualified community health workers, but
not to exceed $2,500 per qualified community health worker.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  In order to claim
the credit allowed pursuant to this section, a taxpayer shall apply to the
Commissioner of Health for certification that one or more of the taxpayers
employees is a qualified community health worker for purposes of receiving the
credit.  The commissioner shall establish a process by which a taxpayer may
submit an application for certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The commissioner shall
review each application for certification submitted by a taxpayer in accordance
with this section and make a determination regarding the approval of an
application for certification within 90 calendar days of the date a complete
application is received.  The commissioner shall issue a written certification
to each taxpayer whose application has been reviewed and approved by the commissioner
in accordance with this section within five calendar days of the date the commissioners
determination is made.  A copy of the certification shall be included in the
filing of a return that includes a claim for the credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If the commissioner
fails to make a determination regarding an application submitted pursuant to
this subsection within 90 calendar days of the date the application is
received, or if the commissioner fails to issue a written certification within
five calendar days of the date a determination is made, the application shall
be deemed to have been approved and the written certification shall be deemed
to have been issued by the commissioner.  Each taxpayer that submitted an
application in accordance with this subsection but fails to receive a
determination from the commissioner within 90 calendar days of the date the
application is submitted, or fails to receive a written certification from the commissioner
within five calendar days of the date of the commissioners determination is
made, shall include a copy of the taxpayers application when filing a return
that includes a claim for the credit allowed in accordance with subsection a.
of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The order of priority
of the application of the credit allowed under this section and any other
credits allowed by law shall be as prescribed by the Director of the Division
of Taxation.  The amount of credits applied under this section against the tax
imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege
period, together with any other payments, credits, deductions, and adjustments
allowed by law, shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax liability otherwise due
and shall not reduce the tax liability for a privilege period to an amount less
than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945,
c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  The amount of the credit otherwise allowable under this
section which cannot be applied for the privilege period due to the limitations
of this subsection or under other provisions of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et
seq.) may be carried forward, if necessary, to the five privilege periods
following the privilege period for which the credit is allowed.</p>

shall be determined by allocating to the taxpayer that proportion of the credit
acquired by the partnership that is equal to the taxpayer's share, whether or
not distributed, of the total distributive income or gain of the partnership

rata share of S corporation income of the New Jersey S corporation for its
privilege period ending within or with the taxpayer's taxable year.</p>

five taxable years following the taxable year for which the credit is allowed.</p>
