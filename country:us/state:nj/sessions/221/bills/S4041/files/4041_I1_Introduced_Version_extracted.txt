Community health workers are certified professionals who serve as liaisons between health care providers and the surrounding community in order to facilitate increased access to health care in medically underserved areas.  These workers also help educate health care providers about many of the unique obstacles faced by members of the surrounding community when seeking access to health care. In order to claim the credit provided under the bill, a taxpayer would be required to submit an application to the Commissioner of Health for certification that one or more of the taxpayers employees is a qualified community health worker for purposes of receiving the credit.  A copy of the certification would be required to be included with the taxpayers tax return when such return is filed.  The commissioner would be required to establish a process by which applications for certification may be submitted.
