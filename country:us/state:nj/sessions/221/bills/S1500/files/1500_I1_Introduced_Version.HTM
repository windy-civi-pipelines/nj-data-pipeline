<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill concerns body worn
cameras for law enforcement officers.  Under current law, subject to the limit
of funds appropriated or otherwise made available, every uniformed State,
county, and municipal patrol law enforcement officer, with certain exceptions,
is required to wear a body worn camera that electronically records audio and
video while acting in the performance of the officers official duties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires every
State, county, and municipal operational detective, while on patrol, to also
wear a body worn camera, without being subject to the limit of any
appropriation.  This bill defines an operational detective as a non-uniformed
law enforcement officer this is deployed outside of a law enforcement station,
barracks, or other law enforcement facility to engage in the detection,
apprehension, arrest, and conviction of offenders against the laws of this
State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As set forth above, there are
certain exceptions to the requirement to wear a body worn camera under current
law.  This bill removes the following exceptions to this requirement: 1) while
engaging in union representation of a member of the collective bargaining
group; and 2) when directed by the Chief or a superior officer for a lawful
purpose.  The bill also provides that certain exceptions only apply when the
officer or detective is assigned to non-uniformed duties which are not included
in the definition of an operational detective. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill adds the
following exceptions to the requirement to wear a body worn camera: 1) while
assigned to conduct surveillance activities; 2) while installing electronic
surveillance equipment; or 3) an officer or detective who is appointed as a
liaison or member of a task force operation where the lead law enforcement agency
is not subject to the provisions of this bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that an
operational detective that is required to wear a body worn camera may conceal
the camera. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the video
and audio recording functions of a body worn camera may be deactivated,
consistent with directives or guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General,
under certain circumstances.  This bill provides that the video and audio
recording functions of the body worn camera also may be deactivated, consistent
with directives or guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, when an
operational detective is developing intelligence from a prospective
confidential informant in order to protect the identity of the potential
informant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a body worn
camera is not to be used to gather intelligence information based on First
Amendment protected speech, associations, or religion, or to record activity
that is unrelated to a response to a call for service or a law enforcement or
investigative encounter between a law enforcement officer and a member of the
public, provided this does not prohibit activation of video and audio recording
functions of a body worn camera as authorized under law and in accordance with
any applicable guidelines or directives promulgated by the Attorney General. 
This bill removes this provision. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill clarifies
that a law enforcement officer is not to be permitted to review or receive an
accounting of a body worn camera recording from the officers assigned body
worn camera that is subject to a certain retention period prior to creating any
required initial reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded
event.  Under current law, the officer is not to review or receive an
accounting of a body worn camera recording. </p>
