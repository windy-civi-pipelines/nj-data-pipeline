(2)   The video and audio recording functions of a body worn camera may be deactivated, consistent with directives or guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, under the following circumstances: (a)   when a civilian conversing with the officer requests that the device be deactivated where it reasonably appears that the person will not provide information or otherwise cooperate with the officer unless that request is respected; (b)   when a person, other than an arrestee, is seeking emergency medical services for themselves or another person and requests that the device be deactivated; (c)   while the officer is participating in a discussion pertaining to criminal investigation strategy and planning, provided that the discussion is not conducted in the immediate presence of a civilian and further provided that the officer is not actively engaged in the collection of physical evidence; [or] (d)   when specifically authorized to do so by an assistant prosecutor or an assistant or deputy attorney general for good and sufficient cause as determined by the assistant prosecutor or assistant or deputy attorney general; or (e)   when an operational detective, as defined in section 1 of P.L.2020, c.128 (C.40A:14-118.3), is developing intelligence from a prospective confidential informant in order to protect the identity of the potential informant.

(b)   a law enforcement officer who is a subject of the body worn camera recording, if that officer reasonably asserts the recording has evidentiary or exculpatory value; (c)   any immediate supervisor of a law enforcement officer whose body worn camera made the recording or who is a subject of the body worn camera recording, if that immediate supervisor reasonably asserts the recording has evidentiary or exculpatory value; (d)   any law enforcement officer, if the body worn camera recording is being retained solely and exclusively for police training purposes; (e)   any member of the public who is a subject of the body worn camera recording; (f)   any parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of the body worn camera recording; or (g)   a deceased subject's next of kin or legally authorized designee. (3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, a body worn camera recording shall be subject to the following additional retention requirements: (a)   when a body worn camera recording pertains to a criminal investigation or otherwise records information that may be subject to discovery in a prosecution, the recording shall be treated as evidence and shall be kept in accordance with the retention period for evidence in a criminal prosecution;

and (4)   body worn camera recordings subject to a minimum three-year retention period solely and exclusively pursuant to subparagraph (e), (f), or (g) of paragraph (2) of subsection j. of this section if a member, parent or legal guardian, or next of kin or designee requests the body worn camera recording not be made available to the public. m.   Any body worn camera recording retained beyond 180 days solely and exclusively pursuant to subparagraph (d) of paragraph (2) of subsection j. of this section shall not be admissible as evidence in any criminal or civil legal or administrative proceeding. n.    A law enforcement officer shall not be permitted to review or receive an accounting of a body worn camera recording from the officers assigned body worn camera that is subject to a minimum three-year retention period pursuant to paragraph (1) or paragraph (3) of [subsubsection] subsection j. of this section prior to creating any required initial reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded event; provided that nothing in this paragraph is intended to prevent the officer from considering, reviewing or receiving an accounting of such a body worn camera recording subsequent to the creation of any required initial reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded event. o.    Body worn camera recordings shall not be divulged or used by any law enforcement agency for any commercial or other non-law enforcement purpose. p.    If a law enforcement agency authorizes a third-party to act as its agent in maintaining recordings from a body worn camera, the agent shall be prohibited from independently accessing, viewing, or altering any recordings, except to delete recordings as required by law or agency retention policies. q.    If a law enforcement officer, employee, or agent fails to adhere to the recording or retention requirements contained in this act, or intentionally interferes with a body worn camera's ability to accurately capture audio or video recordings: (1) the officer, employee, or agent shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action; (2)   there shall be a rebuttable presumption that exculpatory evidence was destroyed or not captured in favor of a criminal defendant who reasonably asserts that exculpatory evidence was destroyed or not captured; and (3)   there shall be a rebuttable presumption that evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim was destroyed or not captured in favor of a civil plaintiff suing the government, a law enforcement agency, or a law enforcement officer for damages based on police misconduct if the plaintiff reasonably asserts that evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim was destroyed or not captured. r.     Any recordings from a body worn camera recorded in contravention of this or any other applicable law shall be immediately destroyed and shall not be admissible as evidence in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding. s.     Nothing in this act shall be deemed to contravene any laws governing the maintenance and destruction of evidence in a criminal investigation or prosecution. (cf:  P.L.2020, c.129, s.1) 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month after enactment. STATEMENT This bill concerns body worn cameras for law enforcement officers.  Under current law, subject to the limit of funds appropriated or otherwise made available, every uniformed State, county, and municipal patrol law enforcement officer, with certain exceptions, is required to wear a body worn camera that electronically records audio and video while acting in the performance of the officers official duties. This bill requires every State, county, and municipal operational detective, while on patrol, to also wear a body worn camera, without being subject to the limit of any appropriation.  This bill defines an operational detective as a non-uniformed law enforcement officer this is deployed outside of a law enforcement station, barracks, or other law enforcement facility to engage in the detection, apprehension, arrest, and conviction of offenders against the laws of this State. As set forth above, there are certain exceptions to the requirement to wear a body worn camera under current law.  This bill removes the following exceptions to this requirement: 1) while engaging in union representation of a member of the collective bargaining group; and 2) when directed by the Chief or a superior officer for a lawful purpose.  The bill also provides that certain exceptions only apply when the officer or detective is assigned to non-uniformed duties which are not included in the definition of an operational detective. In addition, the bill adds the following exceptions to the requirement to wear a body worn camera: 1) while assigned to conduct surveillance activities; 2) while installing electronic surveillance equipment; or 3) an officer or detective who is appointed as a liaison or member of a task force operation where the lead law enforcement agency is not subject to the provisions of this bill. The bill also provides that an operational detective that is required to wear a body worn camera may conceal the camera. Under current law, the video and audio recording functions of a body worn camera may be deactivated, consistent with directives or guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, under certain circumstances.  This bill provides that the video and audio recording functions of the body worn camera also may be deactivated, consistent with directives or guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, when an operational detective is developing intelligence from a prospective confidential informant in order to protect the identity of the potential informant. Under current law, a body worn camera is not to be used to gather intelligence information based on First Amendment protected speech, associations, or religion, or to record activity that is unrelated to a response to a call for service or a law enforcement or investigative encounter between a law enforcement officer and a member of the public, provided this does not prohibit activation of video and audio recording functions of a body worn camera as authorized under law and in accordance with any applicable guidelines or directives promulgated by the Attorney General. This bill removes this provision. Finally, the bill clarifies that a law enforcement officer is not to be permitted to review or receive an accounting of a body worn camera recording from the officers assigned body worn camera that is subject to a certain retention period prior to creating any required initial reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded event.  Under current law, the officer is not to review or receive an accounting of a body worn camera recording.

(cf:  P.L.2020, c.129, s.1) 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month after enactment. STATEMENT This bill concerns body worn cameras for law enforcement officers.  Under current law, subject to the limit of funds appropriated or otherwise made available, every uniformed State, county, and municipal patrol law enforcement officer, with certain exceptions, is required to wear a body worn camera that electronically records audio and video while acting in the performance of the officers official duties. This bill requires every State, county, and municipal operational detective, while on patrol, to also wear a body worn camera, without being subject to the limit of any appropriation.  This bill defines an operational detective as a non-uniformed law enforcement officer this is deployed outside of a law enforcement station, barracks, or other law enforcement facility to engage in the detection, apprehension, arrest, and conviction of offenders against the laws of this State. As set forth above, there are certain exceptions to the requirement to wear a body worn camera under current law.  This bill removes the following exceptions to this requirement: 1) while engaging in union representation of a member of the collective bargaining group; and 2) when directed by the Chief or a superior officer for a lawful purpose.  The bill also provides that certain exceptions only apply when the officer or detective is assigned to non-uniformed duties which are not included in the definition of an operational detective. In addition, the bill adds the following exceptions to the requirement to wear a body worn camera: 1) while assigned to conduct surveillance activities; 2) while installing electronic surveillance equipment; or 3) an officer or detective who is appointed as a liaison or member of a task force operation where the lead law enforcement agency is not subject to the provisions of this bill. The bill also provides that an operational detective that is required to wear a body worn camera may conceal the camera. Under current law, the video and audio recording functions of a body worn camera may be deactivated, consistent with directives or guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, under certain circumstances.  This bill provides that the video and audio recording functions of the body worn camera also may be deactivated, consistent with directives or guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, when an operational detective is developing intelligence from a prospective confidential informant in order to protect the identity of the potential informant. Under current law, a body worn camera is not to be used to gather intelligence information based on First Amendment protected speech, associations, or religion, or to record activity that is unrelated to a response to a call for service or a law enforcement or investigative encounter between a law enforcement officer and a member of the public, provided this does not prohibit activation of video and audio recording functions of a body worn camera as authorized under law and in accordance with any applicable guidelines or directives promulgated by the Attorney General. This bill removes this provision. Finally, the bill clarifies that a law enforcement officer is not to be permitted to review or receive an accounting of a body worn camera recording from the officers assigned body worn camera that is subject to a certain retention period prior to creating any required initial reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded event.  Under current law, the officer is not to review or receive an accounting of a body worn camera recording.
