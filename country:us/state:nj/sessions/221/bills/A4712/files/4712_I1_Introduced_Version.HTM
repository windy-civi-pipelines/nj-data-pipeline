STATEMENT This bill establishes the Office of the Veteran Advocate in, but not of, the Department of Military and Veteran Affairs (DMVA).  If a Department of Veterans Services is established, the Office of the Veteran Advocate will be transferred to be in, but not of, the Department of Veterans Services.  The bill provides that the Veteran Advocate would seek to ensure the provision of effective, appropriate, and timely services for veterans and address abuse and neglect of veterans under State supervision. The Veteran Advocate is to be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.  The Veteran Advocate will be appointed for no more than two five-year terms.  The Veteran Advocate will be paid a salary of not less than $150,000 per year.  The Veteran Advocate may be removed from office for cause by the Governor. The Veteran Advocate will have a wide variety of duties regarding investigating and reporting on the operations and policies of State, county, and local veterans facilities.  The investigatory and reporting duties will address any instances of veteran abuse and neglect.  The Veteran Advocate may conduct site visits to the various facilities under the offices jurisdiction and may consult with other public entities which are directed to provide cooperation and assistance to the Veteran Advocate.  The Veteran Advocate may hold a public hearing and receive testimony from agency and program representatives, the public, and other interested parties.  The Veteran Advocate may also establish and maintain a 24-hour toll-free telephone hotline to receive and respond to calls from members of the public referring concerns to the office.  In instances of formal investigations on specific matters, the Veteran Advocate may also issue subpoenas to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of books, papers, and other documents, and administer oaths to witnesses. The Veteran Advocate will also serve as an ombudsman for veterans and their families by investigating complaints from veterans and family members of veterans in this State regarding issues with veterans services provided by any State entity or any private entity that receives State funding for providing veterans services. Additionally, the Veteran Advocate may intervene in or institute litigation, including appearing in the capacity of an amicus curiae, and may intervene in or institute administrative proceedings before the DMVA to assert the broad public interest of the State in the welfare of veterans and to protect and promote the rights of veterans. If the Veteran Advocate finds a systemic problem in how the State protects veterans, the Veteran Advocate will meet with the DMVA to discuss the problem and identify possible solutions. The Veteran Advocate will then provide its findings and recommendations in writing to the affected agency.  The findings and recommendations are to be made available to the public.  The department is then required to develop a corrective action plan in response to the findings and declarations within 30 days of receipt and submit it to the commissioner of the relevant department and the Veteran Advocate.  The Veteran Advocate will monitor the facilitys implementation of its corrective action plan and will review the required periodic reporting by the facility. The Veteran Advocate will submit an annual report to the Governor, the Legislature, and the head of the DMVA, which will also be made available to the public and will be posted on the DMVA website.  The annual report will include the activities of the office, priorities for veterans services that have been identified by the Veteran Advocate, and recommendations for improvement or necessary changes concerning the variety of services to veterans who are at risk of abuse or neglect and are in State custody. There is an appropriation made from the General Fund to implement the contents of this bill.
