class=HangingAnActChar>and establishing ombudsman for the Department of
Military and Veterans Affairs, supplementing Title 38A of the New Jersey
Statutes, and making an appropriation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    There is established the
Office of the Veteran Advocate in the Executive Branch of the State
Government.  For purposes of complying with Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1
of the New Jersey Constitution, the office is allocated within the Department
of Military and Veterans Affairs, but notwithstanding the allocation, the
office shall be independent of any supervision or control by the department, or
a division, office, or officer thereof, in the performance of its duties.  If
there is established a Department of Veterans Services separate from the Department
of Military and Veterans Affairs, the Office of the Veteran Advocate shall be
transferred to be in, but not of, the Department of Veterans Services, pursuant
to the State Agency Transfer Act, P.L.1971, c.375 (C.52:14D-1 et seq.).  All
references in this act to the department shall mean the Department of Military
and Veterans Affairs.  If there is established a Department of Veterans
Services, all references to the department in this act shall thereafter mean
the Department of Veterans Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  The administrator
and chief executive officer of the office shall be the Veteran Advocate.  The
Veteran Advocate shall be appointed by the Governor, with the advice and
consent of the Senate.  Any person appointed to the position of Veteran
Advocate shall be a veteran.  The Veteran Advocate shall be selected without
regard to political affiliation and on the basis of integrity.  The
qualifications  of the person selected may include, but need not be limited to,
a demonstrated ability in veteran welfare and justice, auditing, law, health
care, management analysis, public administration and investigation, or criminal
justice administration.  Preference may be given to a candidate who is an
attorney-at-law of this State, who has experience in veterans services or has
experience in long-term care services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The salary of the
Veteran Advocate shall not be less than $150,000 per year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The term of Office of
the Veteran Advocate shall be five years, but the Veteran Advocate shall serve until
the appointment and qualification of the successor.  No person shall be
appointed as Veteran Advocate for more than two full terms.  The Veteran Advocate
may appoint, subject to appropriation, such other personnel as the Veteran Advocate
deems necessary for the efficient management of the office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The entire professional
time of the Veteran Advocate shall be devoted to the duties of the position.  A
vacancy occurring in the position of Veteran Advocate shall be filled in the
same manner as the original appointment, except that if the Veteran Advocate
dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the Governor shall appoint an acting
Veteran Advocate who shall serve until the appointment and qualification of the
successor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Veteran Advocate may be
removed from office for cause by the Governor.  Such cause may include, but is
not limited to, substantial neglect of duty, gross misconduct, or conviction of
a crime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  The Veteran Advocate
shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   administer the work of
the Office of the Veteran Advocate;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   appoint and remove such legal
counsel, officers, investigators, stenographic, and clerical assistants, and
other personnel, in the career or unclassified service, as may be required for
the conduct of the office, subject to the provisions of Title 11A of the New
Jersey Statutes, and other applicable statutes and federal regulations, except
as provided otherwise herein;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   formulate and adopt
rules and regulations for the efficient conduct of the work and general
administration of the office, its officers, and employees, in accordance with
the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.); and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   institute or cause to be
instituted such legal proceedings or processes consistent with the Rules
Governing the Courts of New Jersey as may be necessary to properly enforce and
give effect to any of the powers or duties of the Veteran Advocate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) ensure that veterans in
the care of or receiving services under the supervision of the department
receive treatment in accordance with the applicable State and federal statutes
and regulations at all times, with full respect for the veterans personal
dignity and right to privacy; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) ensure that veterans in
the care of or receiving services under the supervision of the department receive
timely, safe, and effective services, as outlined in the applicable State and
federal statutes and regulations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7) aid and coordinate with
local veterans service officers to ensure veterans receive all available State
and federal benefits; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8) examine, on a system-wide
basis, the care and services that the department provides veterans; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9) advise the public and

Advocate, and recommendations for improvement or necessary changes concerning
the variety of services to veterans who are at risk of abuse or neglect and are
