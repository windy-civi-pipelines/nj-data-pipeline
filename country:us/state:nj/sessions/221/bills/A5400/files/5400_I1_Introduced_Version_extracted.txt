The bill defines energy incentive program as any State program that primarily promotes energy efficiency among residential, commercial, or industrial entities.  In addition, the bill defines utility assistance program as any State program that offers financial assistance for utility services to residential customers or otherwise establishes utility protections for residential customers. With this legislation, the sponsor intends to centralize the administration of the States energy incentive and utility assistance programs and provide one common application process for utility assistance programs.  By housing these programs in one office, New Jersey can reduce duplicative administrative costs and provide better energy and utility services to the public.  In addition, the relocation of these programs will allow the board more time to focus on its role as the regulatory entity for public utilities, thereby ensuring that utility customers within the State receive affordable utility service.
