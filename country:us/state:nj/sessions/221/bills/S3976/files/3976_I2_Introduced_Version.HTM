The bill also provides that the priority course registration is to occur using the same procedures used by other segments of the student population that are offered priority registration by the institution. Prior to the registration period for each academic semester, an institution of higher education is required to notify students eligible for priority course registration under the bill. Currently, some institutions of higher education offer priority registration to certain students, including student-athletes, students with disabilities, and current and former military service members. This bill requires those institutions to expand priority registration eligibility to include student parents.
