CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning unlawful discrimination against immigrants and non-citizens, amending various parts of the statutory law and supplementing chapter 5 of Title 10 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  Section 3 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-3) is amended to read as follows: 3.    The Legislature finds and declares that practices of discrimination against any of its inhabitants, because of race, creed, color, national origin, immigration status, citizenship status, ancestry, age, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, marital status, familial status, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, disability or nationality, are matters of concern to the government of the State, and that such discrimination threatens not only the rights and proper privileges of the inhabitants of the State but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic State; provided, however, that nothing in this expression of policy prevents the making of legitimate distinctions between United States citizens, non-United States citizens, and [aliens] immigrants when required by federal law or otherwise necessary to promote the national interest. The Legislature further declares its opposition to such practices of discrimination when directed against any person by reason of the race, creed, color, national origin, immigration status, citizenship status, ancestry, age, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, marital status, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, disability or nationality of that person or that person's family members, partners, members, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, superintendents, agents, employees, business associates, suppliers, or customers, in order that the economic prosperity and general welfare of the inhabitants of the State may be protected and ensured. The Legislature further finds that because of discrimination, people suffer personal hardships, and the State suffers a grievous harm.  The personal hardships include: economic loss; time loss; physical and emotional stress; and in some cases severe emotional trauma, illness, homelessness or other irreparable harm resulting from the strain of employment controversies; relocation, search and moving difficulties; anxiety caused by lack of information, uncertainty, and resultant planning difficulty; career, education, family and social disruption; and adjustment problems, which particularly impact on those protected by this act.  Such harms have, under the common law, given rise to legal remedies, including compensatory and punitive damages.  The Legislature intends that such damages be available to all persons protected by this act and that this act shall be liberally construed in combination with other protections available under the laws of this State.

In addition to any other relief authorized by the "Law Against Discrimination," P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) for discrimination in compensation or in the financial terms or conditions of employment, liability shall accrue and an aggrieved person may obtain relief for back pay for the entire period of time, except not more than six years, in which the violation with regard to discrimination in compensation or in the financial terms or conditions of employment has been continuous, if the violation continues to occur within the statute of limitations.

provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to bar any place of public accommodation which is in its nature reasonably restricted exclusively to individuals of one sex, and which shall include but not be limited to any summer camp, day camp, or resort camp, bathhouse, dressing room, swimming pool, gymnasium, comfort station, dispensary, clinic or hospital, or school or educational institution which is restricted exclusively to individuals of one sex, provided individuals shall be admitted based on their gender identity or expression, from refusing, withholding from or denying to any individual of the opposite sex any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof on the basis of sex;

(ii)   The number of individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held religious observance or practice. (iii) For an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. (c)   An accommodation shall be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the position in which he or she is employed. (d)   (i) The provisions of this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees. (ii)   This subsection q. shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of attendance to employees is essential to prevent undue hardship to the employer.  The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph (d) shall be upon the employer. r.     For any employer to take reprisals against any employee for requesting from, discussing with, or disclosing to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation, including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to, or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the employee herself to any other employee or former employee of the employer or to any authorized representative of the other employee or former employee. s.     For an employer to treat, for employment-related purposes, [a woman] an employee that the employer knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  In addition, an employer of an employee who is [a woman] an individual affected by pregnancy shall make available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of [her] the employees physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of [a] an employee [breast feeding her] breastfeeding the employees infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or privileges of employment for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any employee's rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding. For the purposes of this section "pregnancy or breastfeeding" means pregnancy, childbirth, and [breast feeding] breastfeeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from childbirth. For the purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity requirement. t.     For an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates: (1)   That the differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity or quality of production; (2)   That the factor or factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class; (3)   That each of the factors is applied reasonably; (4)   That one or more of the factors account for the entire wage differential; and (5)   That the factors are job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Comparisons of wage rates shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. For the purposes of this subsection, "member of a protected class" means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed, color, national origin, immigration status, citizenship status, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or liability for service in the armed forces, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or requiring to retire from employment or discriminating against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment. (cf: P.L.2021, c.248, s.2) 9.   (New section) Immigration status or citizenship status, disclosures, verification. a.  It shall not be an unlawful employment practice or an unlawful discrimination pursuant to P.L.1945, c. 169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), for any person to discriminate on the basis of immigration status or citizenship status, or to make any inquiry as to a persons immigration status or citizenship status, or to give preference to a person who is a citizen or national of the United States over an equally qualified person who is a not a citizen or national of the United States, when such discrimination, inquiry, or preference is required or expressly permitted by federal or state law or regulation. In addition, nothing in P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall be interpreted to prohibit inquiries or determinations based on immigration status or citizenship status when such actions are necessary to obtain the benefits of a federal or state program. b.  Nothing in P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall be interpreted to prohibit disclosures of information regarding or relating to the immigration status or citizenship status of a person, where required or expressly permitted by federal or state law or regulation or when in compliance with any legal obligation under a subpoena, warrant issued by a court, or order issued by a court. c. Nothing in P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall be interpreted to prohibit verification of immigration status or citizenship status or any discrimination based upon verified immigration status or citizenship status, where required or expressly permitted by federal or state law or regulation. Nothing in P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall be construed to alter an employers rights or obligations under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. s.1324a, regarding obtaining documentation evidencing identity and authorization for employment. Any action taken by an employer that is required by 8 U.S.C. s.1324a is not a violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.). 10.   This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill enhances protections under the Law Against Discrimination (LAD) for immigrants and non-citizens. Immigration Status.  The bill adds immigration status as a protected characteristic in employment, housing, and public accommodations. The bill defines the term as an individuals category of presence in the United States, including but not limited to, naturalized citizen, permanent resident, asylee, refugee, work authorization holder, or undocumented individual. Citizenship Status. Citizenship status is also added by the bill as a protected characteristic in employment, housing, and public accommodations. The bill defines citizenship status as an individuals status as a citizen or national of the United States or a country or countries other than the United States. Housing Protections; Exceptions. The bill prohibits a housing provider from asking about a persons immigration status or citizenship status or requiring that the person disclose or make any statement, representation, or certification concerning the persons immigration or citizenship status.  The bill also prohibits a housing provider from threatening to disclose or actually disclosing information about the immigration or citizenship status of a tenant, occupant, or prospective tenant or occupant to harass or intimidate the person, influence the person to vacate a dwelling, recover possession of a dwelling, or retaliate against the person.  The bill makes an exception to the protections for immigration or citizenship status if distinctions based on immigration or citizenship are required by federal or state law or regulation, or if distinctions are necessary to obtain the benefits of a federal or state program.  The bill provides that disclosure of information concerning immigration or citizenship status is not prohibited where required or permitted by federal or state law or regulation. Gender-neutral Language. The bill changes gendered language in the LAD to gender-neutral language. Unlawful Discrimination. The bill adds the term unlawful before the term discrimination throughout the LAD to clarify that the LAD prohibits only unlawful discrimination.  The LAD does not apply to discrimination that may be lawful.  For example, practices that result in a disproportionately negative impact on members of a protected class constitute unlawful discrimination only if the entity engaging in the practices cannot show that it is using the practices for a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest or cannot show that there is a less discriminatory alternative that meets that interest.

(1) For any employer to impose upon a person as a condition of obtaining or retaining employment, including opportunities for promotion, advancement or transfers, any terms or conditions that would require a person to violate or forego a sincerely held religious practice or religious observance, including but not limited to the observance of any particular day or days or any portion thereof as a Sabbath or other holy day in accordance with the requirements of the religion or religious belief, unless, after engaging in a bona fide effort, the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate the employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall not be entitled to premium wages or premium benefits for work performed during hours to which those premium wages or premium benefits would ordinarily be applicable, if the employee is working during those hours only as an accommodation to [his] the employees religious requirements. Nothing in this subsection q. shall be construed as reducing: (a)   The number of the hours worked by the employee which are counted towards the accruing of seniority, pension or other benefits; or (b)   Any premium wages or benefits provided to an employee pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. (2)   For an employer to refuse to permit an employee to utilize leave, as provided for in this subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employee's sincerely held religious observance or practice.  Except where it would cause an employer to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at [his] the persons place of employment during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement of [his] the persons religion, [he] the person observes as [his] the persons Sabbath or other holy day, including a reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between [his] the persons place of employment and [his] the persons home; provided that any such absence from work shall, wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time, or shall be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by the employer of that person as leave taken without pay. (3) (a) For purposes of this subsection q., "undue hardship" means an accommodation requiring unreasonable expense or difficulty, unreasonable interference with the safe or efficient operation of the workplace or a violation of a bona fide seniority system or a violation of any provision of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. (b)   In determining whether the accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the factors considered shall include: (i)    The identifiable cost of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer. (ii)   The number of individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held religious observance or practice. (iii) For an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. (c)   An accommodation shall be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the position in which he or she is employed. (d)   (i) The provisions of this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees. (ii)   This subsection q. shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of attendance to employees is essential to prevent undue hardship to the employer.  The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph (d) shall be upon the employer. r.     For any employer to take reprisals against any employee for requesting from, discussing with, or disclosing to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation, including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to, or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the employee herself to any other employee or former employee of the employer or to any authorized representative of the other employee or former employee. s.     For an employer to treat, for employment-related purposes, [a woman] an employee that the employer knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  In addition, an employer of an employee who is [a woman] an individual affected by pregnancy shall make available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of [her] the employees physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of [a] an employee [breast feeding her] breastfeeding the employees infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or privileges of employment for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any employee's rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding. For the purposes of this section "pregnancy or breastfeeding" means pregnancy, childbirth, and [breast feeding] breastfeeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from childbirth. For the purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity requirement. t.     For an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates: (1)   That the differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity or quality of production; (2)   That the factor or factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class; (3)   That each of the factors is applied reasonably; (4)   That one or more of the factors account for the entire wage differential; and (5)   That the factors are job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Comparisons of wage rates shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. For the purposes of this subsection, "member of a protected class" means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed, color, national origin, immigration status, citizenship status, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or liability for service in the armed forces, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or requiring to retire from employment or discriminating against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment. (cf: P.L.2021, c.248, s.2) 9.   (New section) Immigration status or citizenship status, disclosures, verification. a.  It shall not be an unlawful employment practice or an unlawful discrimination pursuant to P.L.1945, c. 169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), for any person to discriminate on the basis of immigration status or citizenship status, or to make any inquiry as to a persons immigration status or citizenship status, or to give preference to a person who is a citizen or national of the United States over an equally qualified person who is a not a citizen or national of the United States, when such discrimination, inquiry, or preference is required or expressly permitted by federal or state law or regulation. In addition, nothing in P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall be interpreted to prohibit inquiries or determinations based on immigration status or citizenship status when such actions are necessary to obtain the benefits of a federal or state program. b.  Nothing in P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall be interpreted to prohibit disclosures of information regarding or relating to the immigration status or citizenship status of a person, where required or expressly permitted by federal or state law or regulation or when in compliance with any legal obligation under a subpoena, warrant issued by a court, or order issued by a court. c. Nothing in P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall be interpreted to prohibit verification of immigration status or citizenship status or any discrimination based upon verified immigration status or citizenship status, where required or expressly permitted by federal or state law or regulation. Nothing in P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall be construed to alter an employers rights or obligations under the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. s.1324a, regarding obtaining documentation evidencing identity and authorization for employment. Any action taken by an employer that is required by 8 U.S.C. s.1324a is not a violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.). 10.   This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill enhances protections under the Law Against Discrimination (LAD) for immigrants and non-citizens. Immigration Status.  The bill adds immigration status as a protected characteristic in employment, housing, and public accommodations. The bill defines the term as an individuals category of presence in the United States, including but not limited to, naturalized citizen, permanent resident, asylee, refugee, work authorization holder, or undocumented individual. Citizenship Status. Citizenship status is also added by the bill as a protected characteristic in employment, housing, and public accommodations. The bill defines citizenship status as an individuals status as a citizen or national of the United States or a country or countries other than the United States. Housing Protections; Exceptions. The bill prohibits a housing provider from asking about a persons immigration status or citizenship status or requiring that the person disclose or make any statement, representation, or certification concerning the persons immigration or citizenship status.  The bill also prohibits a housing provider from threatening to disclose or actually disclosing information about the immigration or citizenship status of a tenant, occupant, or prospective tenant or occupant to harass or intimidate the person, influence the person to vacate a dwelling, recover possession of a dwelling, or retaliate against the person.  The bill makes an exception to the protections for immigration or citizenship status if distinctions based on immigration or citizenship are required by federal or state law or regulation, or if distinctions are necessary to obtain the benefits of a federal or state program.  The bill provides that disclosure of information concerning immigration or citizenship status is not prohibited where required or permitted by federal or state law or regulation. Gender-neutral Language. The bill changes gendered language in the LAD to gender-neutral language. Unlawful Discrimination. The bill adds the term unlawful before the term discrimination throughout the LAD to clarify that the LAD prohibits only unlawful discrimination.  The LAD does not apply to discrimination that may be lawful.  For example, practices that result in a disproportionately negative impact on members of a protected class constitute unlawful discrimination only if the entity engaging in the practices cannot show that it is using the practices for a substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest or cannot show that there is a less discriminatory alternative that meets that interest.
