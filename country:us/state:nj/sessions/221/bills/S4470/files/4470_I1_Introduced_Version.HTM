<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 12 of P.L.1995,
c.244 (C.2A:50-64) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  a.  With respect to the
sale of a mortgaged premises under foreclosure action, each sheriff in this
State shall provide for, but not be limited to, the following uniform
procedures:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  Bidding in the name of
the assignee of the foreclosing plaintiff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  That adjournment of the
sale of the foreclosed property shall be in accordance with N.J.S.2A:17-36.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) (a) The sheriff shall
conduct a sale within 150 days of the sheriff's receipt of any writ of
execution issued by the court in any foreclosure proceeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  If it becomes apparent
that the sheriff cannot comply with the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this
paragraph (3), the foreclosing plaintiff may apply to the office for an order
appointing a Special Master to hold the foreclosure sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Upon the foreclosing
plaintiff making such application to the office, the office shall issue the
appropriate order appointing a Special Master to hold the foreclosure sale. The
office may issue the order to appoint a Special Master to hold foreclosure
sales for one or more properties within a vicinage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  That notice for the sale
of a foreclosed upon residential property be mailed to the primary address of
the foreclosed upon defendant and to the address of the foreclosed upon
residential property.  The language used on the exterior of the envelope shall
comply with the federal &quot;Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,&quot; 15
U.S.C. s.1692 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) (a) That notice of the
upset price for the sale of a foreclosed upon residential property be provided
at least four weeks prior to the sheriff's sale and posted on the Internet
website of the sheriff's office and on any other medium used to provide notice
of the sheriff's sale.  The upset price provided in the notice shall be a good
faith estimate of the upset price on the day of the sheriff's sale; however,
the upset price on the day of the sheriff's sale shall not increase by more
than three percent from the upset price originally provided in the notice.  If
the sheriff's sale is delayed or postponed, or if circumstances occur that
require unforeseen advances to protect the borrower or the foreclosed upon
residential property in the event of vandalism, weather damage, or other
emergency property preservation needs, the upset price may be adjusted to
reflect these costs in the latest price; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  Prior to providing the
upset price to the sheriff's office pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this
paragraph, the foreclosing plaintiff or agent of the foreclosing plaintiff
shall be prohibited from contacting the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin
of the foreclosed upon defendant, or a nonprofit community development
corporation to inquire whether the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin, or
nonprofit community development corporation intends to participate in the
sheriff's sale for the foreclosed upon property or exercise the provisions of
P.L.2023, c.255 (C.2A:50-56a et al.). If, after providing notice of the upset
price pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the foreclosing plaintiff is
informed that the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin, or nonprofit
community development corporation intends to participate in the sheriff's sale
or exercise the provisions of P.L.2023, c.255 (C.2A:50-56a et al.), the
foreclosing plaintiff shall not attempt to delay or postpone the sheriff's sale
by reason of the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin, or nonprofit community
development corporation's intention to participate in the sheriff's sale or
exercise the provisions of P.L.2023, c.255 (C.2A:50-56a et al.).  Any notice
required pursuant to this paragraph shall comply with the federal &quot;Fair
Debt Collection Practices Act,&quot; 15 U.S.C. s.1692 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  Prior to the sale of
residential property, the foreclosing plaintiff shall disclose, if known,
whether the property is vacant, tenant-occupied, or owner-occupied.  If the
property is vacant, the foreclosing plaintiff shall provide the successful
bidder access to the property if the foreclosing plaintiff has such access and
may condition access by the successful bidder on being accompanied by a
representative of the foreclosing plaintiff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7) (a) Except as otherwise
provided in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph, the successful bidder
at the sheriff's sale shall pay a 20 percent deposit in either cash or by a
certified or cashier's check, made payable to the sheriff of the county in
which the sale is conducted, immediately upon the conclusion of the foreclosure
sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  In the case of
residential property in which the successful bidder is the foreclosed upon
defendant, next of kin, tenant, nonprofit community development corporation, or
a bidder who shall occupy the property as the bidder's primary residence for a
period of at least 84 months, the successful bidder who has fulfilled the
requirements set forth in subsection e. of this section shall pay a 3.5 percent
deposit of the original upset price listed in the notice provided by the
foreclosing plaintiff pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (5) of this
subsection, or the final starting upset price listed for the sale of the property,
whichever is less, with the rest of the balance due within 90 business days by
cash, certified or cashier's check, or by wire transfer, made payable to the
sheriff of the county in which the sale is conducted or to the Special Master,
if the sheriff cannot comply with the provisions of subparagraph (a) of
paragraph (3) of this subsection, immediately upon the conclusion of the
foreclosure sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   If the successful bidder
cannot satisfy the requirement of this paragraph that is applicable to the bidder,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises oversight of
the Community Wealth Preservation Program and requirements for nonprofit
community development corporations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a nonprofit
community development corporation with a written agreement to purchase a
foreclosed upon residential property for the foreclosed upon defendant, next of
kin of the foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant of that foreclosed upon
property will be subject to a 30-year renewable deed restriction requiring the
nonprofit and any future owners to sell the property to a household earning no
more than 120 percent of area median income and spending no more than 35
percent of gross monthly income on the mortgage, property taxes, interest, and
home insurance of the property or, if the nonprofit or future owners decide to
rent the property, rent the property to a household earning no more than 80
percent of area median income and spending no more than 35 percent of gross
monthly income on rent.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides a
formula for future owners that are still subject to the deed restriction to
determine the future sales price of the property.  Nonprofits and future owners
subject to the deed restriction will additionally be subject to State
affordable housing laws and regulations.  Despite the deed restriction above, a
nonprofit with a written agreement to purchase the property for a foreclosed
upon defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant will
not be subject to the deed restriction language if the foreclosed upon
defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant decide to
purchase the property back from the nonprofit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
sheriffs office will now be required to, within 90 days of the date of a
sheriffs sale, deliver a fully executed deed to the successful bidder at the
sale. Current law requires a sheriffs office to deliver a fully executed deed
to the successful bidder of a sheriffs sale within two weeks of the date of
sale.  The bill additionally extends the statutory right of redemption for
foreclosed upon defendants to within 90 days of the date of the sheriffs sale,
instead of 10 days after the date of sale as currently provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill additionally removes
the right of first of refusal for tenants of the foreclosed upon property to
purchase the property and removes the right of second refusal for nonprofit
community development corporations that do not have a written agreement to
purchase the property for the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin of the
foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant of the foreclosed upon property.  The bill
also requires successful individual bidders who will occupy the foreclosed upon
residential property for 84 months to be subject to a deed restriction that
outlines the requirements that successful individual bidders must follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides new
requirements for nonprofit community development corporations that agree in
writing to purchase a foreclosed upon residential property for a foreclosed
upon defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant of the
foreclosed upon property.  Nonprofits will now be required to negotiate with
the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon defendant, or
tenant on a lease agreement that must include the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  an affordability
benchmark that will require lease payments to be set within a reasonable
percentage of the occupants verified monthly income, not to exceed 39 percent
of total household income;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  lease payments that are
set at a fixed-rate or indexed to inflation, with a maximum increase of no more
than two percent per year;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  a lease schedule of a
minimum of 12 months, with renewal options and clear conditions for
termination;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  eviction protection
clauses for occupants who comply with lease obligations; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  an option to purchase the
property from the corporation, which must include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   the purchase price,
including the total sales price broken down into the monthly principal,
interest, taxes, and insurance. The total monthly housing cost must be
comprised of the principal, interest, taxes, and insurance, and must not exceed
39 percent of the households total monthly income.  If the offered sales price
would cause monthly housing costs to exceed 39 percent, the sales price will be
reduced to align with the monthly housing cost limit;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  a timeframe, which must
be no less than one year from the date in which the occupant signs the lease
agreement, in which the occupant may exercise the option to purchase the
property; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   an ownership transition
process, with defined requirements for title transfer, including compliance
with escrow, inspections, and financial readiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a nonprofit
community development corporation that decides to independently bid for a
foreclosed upon residential property or purchase a foreclosed upon property on
behalf of a foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon
defendant, or tenant of the foreclosed upon property will be required to be
included within a list of nonprofit community development corporations
established by the Department of Community Affairs before it can purchase a
foreclosed upon property.  To be included within the departments list, the
nonprofit must be in existence for 48 months, meet the provided definition of a
State community housing development organization, and submit the following
materials to the department:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the most recent form 990
that the nonprofit community development corporation provided to the United
States Internal Revenue Service;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  letters of reference from
at least three other nonprofit community development corporations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  a signed statement from
the chief executive officer of the nonprofit community development corporation
confirming that none of board members of the corporation have been found liable
of a housing violation or violation pursuant to the Consumer Fraud Act within
the past 10 years;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  an affidavit signed by
the executive director and president of the board of directors, or equivalent,
of the nonprofit community development corporation that names any representatives
that are authorized to bid on behalf of the corporation during the sheriffs
sale.  The authorized representatives may be an employee or a board member of
the corporation; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  any other information
that the department deems necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>A nonprofit community development
corporation that is not included in the departments list pursuant to this
paragraph will be prohibited from entering a bid in a sheriffs sale.  A
corporation that is included within the list pursuant to this bill will be required
to provide the materials required pursuant to this bill once each year to the
department to maintain eligibility within the list.  A corporation must inform
the department if there are material changes to the items provided to the
department.  The department will be required to publish and maintain the list
of eligible nonprofit community development organizations on its Internet
website. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill further provides that
a nonprofit community development corporation intending to bid in a sheriffs
sale for a foreclosed upon residential property will be required to provide to
the sheriff on the date of sale with a watermarked certificate from the
Department Community Affairs confirming that the nonprofit is on the
departments list of eligible nonprofit community development corporations. 
Each sheriffs office will be required to consult the list of eligible
nonprofit community development corporations established by the department
before permitting a nonprofit to bid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
nonprofit community development corporation that is included on the
departments list of eligible nonprofit community development corporations will
be limited to purchasing one foreclosed residential property in any given
county per month, with a maximum of two properties purchased within the State
per month.  The aforementioned limits will not apply to a nonprofit that
purchased a foreclosed residential property on behalf of a foreclosed upon
defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant of the foreclosed
upon property.  The bill also revises requirements for nonprofits that
independently bid on foreclosed upon residential properties and revises fines
and enforcement provisions for nonprofits and successful individual bidders
that fail to meet the requirements of the Community Wealth Preservation
Program.  The bill additionally includes new reporting requirements for
sheriffs offices, revises the definition of nonprofit community development
corporation, and includes a new definition for the term next of kin.  </p>
