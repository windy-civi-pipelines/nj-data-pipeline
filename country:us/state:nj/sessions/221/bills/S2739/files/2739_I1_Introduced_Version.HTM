program shall be coordinated with the Department of Military and Veterans
Affairs.  The program may be interfaced with any program currently administered
by the agency for first time homebuyers, but a recipient shall not be required
to meet the other eligibility criteria of any other homebuyer program in order
to be eligible to participate in the matching grant program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Matching grants shall be
made on the basis of available funds to eligible military personnel on a dollar

applied to closing costs, equity payments, or for any other purpose which
assists the recipient in purchasing a home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In order to be eligible
for a matching grant, a member of the United States Armed Forces or the New

Applicants shall not be eligible for more than one matching grant under the
program.  For the purposes of this act, members of the United States Armed
Forces includes both active and reserve component members.  </p>
