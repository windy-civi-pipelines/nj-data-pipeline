<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning the prevention and remediation of
discrimination and harassment occurring in certain campaign committees,
supplementing P.L.1973, c.83 (C.19:44A-1 et seq.), and making an appropriation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Years of reporting,
legislative hearings, public listening sessions and surveys have documented the
toxic climate of harassment, sexual violence and misogyny that too often
pervades New Jerseys political culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Political candidates,
campaigns and party organizations have a vested interest in suppressing, hiding
or ignoring allegations of sexual misconduct to avert political damage or
preserve personal power and control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The practice of
politics is conducted in a fluid sphere of political campaigns, party
organizations, and the after-hours intersection of politics, government,
lobbying and advocacy where traditional human resource policies and protections
often do not apply or do not exist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Survivors of sexual
violence, harassment and other misconduct risk retaliation, side-lining or the
loss of their political careers if they complain publicly or even privately
about misogynistic treatment, and those who do rarely receive justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Therefore, it is
necessary to require campaigns and political organizations to adopt
anti-harassment policies, implement training and designate individuals to
receive confidential complaints of sexual misconduct, and also to establish an
independent investigative unit not subject to control by campaign, party or
elected officials to receive and probe allegations of sexual violence,
harassment and misconduct in the world of New Jersey politics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act,
P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Campaign and political staff
includes any person, whether paid or unpaid, rendering personal, clerical,
administrative, or professional services, including, without limitation, public
relations, research, legal, canvassing, telephone, speech writing, or other
such services; except that campaign and political staff shall not include
such persons who are unpaid if they render such services four or less days
during one calendar year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Candidate committee, joint
candidates committee, political party committee, and continuing political
committee shall have the meanings prescribed for those terms by section 3 of
P.L.1973, c.83 (C.19:44A-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Governmental affairs agent
shall have the same meaning as provided in section 3 of P.L.1971, c.183
(C.52:13C-20).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Member of the press means
any individual who works in the gathering, processing, disseminating, and
delivery of news and information that serves the public interest to the public
through mass media, including on Internet platforms, television, radio, and in
newspapers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Political activities means
any effort to support or oppose any candidate, partisan political office, or
partisan political group. Political activities shall also include any efforts
to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation, policy, or regulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Political contributions
means any payment to an individual, other than a candidate, political party, or
an affiliated organization, to render services and engage in political
activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Protected category means
race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, sex, gender
identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, pregnancy or breast
feeding, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status,
familial status, religion, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait, genetic
information, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, or
disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Sexual harassment means
unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or
physical conduct of a sexual nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Third-party harassment means
unwelcome behavior involving any protected category that is not directed at an
individual but exists in the workplace and interferes with an individual's
ability to do the individuals job.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Trauma-informed care or
trauma-informed interviewing means care or services provided pursuant to an
approach that: (1) recognizes the presence of trauma symptoms in a person; (2)
acknowledges the role trauma may play in an individuals life; (3) integrates
knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices; (4) is guided
by principles of establishing safety, trustworthiness and transparency, peer
support, collaboration and mutuality, empowerment and choice, and an
understanding of cultural, historical, and gender issues; and (5) actively
avoids re-traumatization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  There is created
within the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, established pursuant
to section 5 of P.L.1973, c.83 (C.19:44A-5), an Office on Discrimination and
Harassment Prevention.  The office shall be comprised of at least three
employees, which shall include, at a minimum, a director and two
investigators.  The investigators shall have professional expertise in the area
of survivor support and trauma-informed interviewing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. The office shall receive,
review, and investigate, in a prompt, thorough, and impartial manner, all
reasonable and good faith complaints of discrimination or harassment received
from or made against:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   any candidate or
campaign and political staff member of a candidate committee, joint candidates

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
adoption of and training on an anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy
by candidate committees, joint candidates committees, political party
committees, and continuing political committee.  The bill creates the Office on
Discrimination and Harassment Prevention (ODHP) within the New Jersey Election
Law Enforcement Commission and appropriates $2,000,000 to the commission to
carry out the purposes of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The ODHP will be comprised of
at least three employees, including a director and two investigators, who are
to have professional expertise in the areas of survivor support and
trauma-informed interviewing.  The office will receive, review, and investigate
complaints of discrimination or harassment received from or made against:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   any candidate or
campaign and political staff member of a candidate committee, joint candidates
committee, or political party committee;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   any member of a
political party committee or continuing political committee;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   any individual engaged
in political activities, including individuals providing or soliciting
political contributions; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   any member of the press,
a governmental affairs agent, or a third-party vendor who will be in the
physical presence of the committees offices or normal place of business or
will be engaging with any candidate, committee member, or campaign and
political staff member on a digital or virtual platform or by means of
electronic communication in the course of performing their duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the ODHP to
maintain an official Internet site, a secure portal through which complaints
may be submitted, and a telephone number by which members of the public may
contact the office.  Confirmation of receipt of a complaint must be provided to
a person submitting a complaint through the portal within 48 hours of
submission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The ODHP, in consultation with
individuals or organizations with expertise in harassment and bias, is to adopt
a policy that meets the requirements of the bill, review the policy at least
once every two years, and modify the policy as necessary.  The policy must:
outline prohibited conduct; require compliance with the policy; require that
appropriate measures be taken to ensure that prohibited conduct does not occur;
and provide procedures for the reporting, investigation, final determination,
remediation, and discipline of prohibited conduct.  The policy is to include
provisions regarding confidentiality, retaliation, and false accusations.  The
policy must also provide for the consideration of recommendations for
remediation made by the person against whom the harassment or discrimination
was directed.  The policy will apply whether or not the conduct occurs in the
office and will also apply to electronic transmissions, such as email, text
messages, or various postings on social media. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The office is to approve at
least one program that will provide training on the model policy or on the
recognition, reporting, remediation, and prevention of discrimination and
harassment.  The program may be developed in-house or offered by a third party,
and may be available either in-person or virtually. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The policy is to be
distributed to a person upon commencement of participation on the committee or
campaign and within five business days of any modification to the policy.  The
candidate and members of campaign and political staff who will complete 280
hours of work for the committee in a calendar year are to receive training on
the policy and submit a certification of completion to the committee, a copy of
which will be filed with ODHP and considered public information.  The bill also
grants to the office the authority to issue fines for noncompliance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires candidates,
members, campaign and political staff, and third-party vendors to provide a
list of any campaign committees with which the person participated over the
previous 10 years and a written attestation as to whether the person:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   has been the subject of
any investigation by ODHP, or by any campaign committee, that did not result in
a finding that the allegations were false or not substantiated;  or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   has been disciplined,
discharged, or asked to resign with respect to allegations of discrimination or
harassment, or has voluntarily separated during any investigation of those
allegations.  Candidates, members, campaign and political staff, and
third-party vendors must also provide written authorization consenting to the
disclosure of information related to those allegations and releasing the office
and any committee from liability that may arise from that disclosure.  Committees
are to provide this information to the office, which must verify the
information with its records and notify the committee of any discrepancies. 
This information will not be deemed a government record under the open public
records act or the common law concerning access to public records.  The bill
provides for a penalty of not more than $500 for any person who is determined
pursuant to an administrative hearing to have willfully provided false
information or willfully failed to disclose information required under the
bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the ODHP to
provide by February 1 of each year a report to the Governor, the Legislature,
and the public, on its Internet site, documenting the number of cases reported
and investigated during the previous calendar year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also bans
nondisclosure agreements concerning discrimination, retaliation, or harassment
and requires that each candidate committee, joint candidates committee,
political party committee, and continuing political committee is required to notify
in writing any candidate, committee member, or campaign and political staff
member who has signed or signs such confidentiality forms that those forms are
deemed unenforceable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill creates an
11-member advisory board to provide assistance, advice, and guidance to ODHP as
needed, including in drafting and reviewing policies and procedures and
tracking implementation of the provisions of the bill.  The members of the
board include: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the Secretary of State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the director of the Division
on Civil Rights;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the director of the
Division on Women;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   the director of the
Office on Discrimination and Harassment Prevention;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   one member of the public
chosen by the Governor from among three persons recommended by the New Jersey
Coalition Against Sexual Assault; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   two members of the
public appointed by the Governor with expertise in the area of anti-harassment,
one of whom is to have experience in education or advocacy related to
anti-harassment in campaigns; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   four public members with
expertise in the area of anti-harassment to be appointed, one each, by each of
the following: the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the General
Assembly, the Minority Leader of the Senate, and the Minority Leader of the
General Assembly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The board is to adopt and
implement a method for receiving anonymous feedback from individuals who have
interacted with ODHP.  The bill requires the office to provide to the board
quarterly data concerning the number of cases reported and investigated during
the previous three months.  The board is to provide to the office, the
Governor, and the Legislature two reports, one every three years following
appointment of its members, concerning implementation of the provisions of the
bill and any recommendations for legislation or regulations to improve upon
implementation and adherence.  The board will dissolve upon issuance of the
second report.</p>
