Specifically, the bill provides that the State Treasurer, or the Treasurers designee, would serve as the sole chairperson of the committee.  The bill also mandates the Division of Risk Management in the Department of the Treasury to provide resources as necessary to operate the committee. Additionally, the bill revises the committees scope of duties by authorizing the committee to provide advisory recommendations to the director related to worker safety and capital repair issues.  The bill also provides that the committee would no longer be mandated to: (1) develop a program and schedule for risk management training of appropriate managers within the principal departments; (2) oversee the establishment and operation of the risk management committees of each of the principal departments; or (3) have the commissioner of each executive department direct the appropriate personnel to administer and enforce any programs or protocols developed by the committee. Lastly, the bill exempts the Risk Management Committee from the definition of a public body under the Senator Byron M. Baer Open Public Meetings Act, which requires public bodies to provide adequate notice to the public regarding their upcoming meetings.
