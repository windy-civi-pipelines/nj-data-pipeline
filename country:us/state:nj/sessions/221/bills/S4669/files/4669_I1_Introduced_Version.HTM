STATEMENT This bill imposes several requirements on app stores and developers related to age verification.  Under the bill, an app store provider is required to verify the age of all State residents who create an account with the app store provider and if the individual is a minor, require the account to be affiliated with a parent account and obtain parental consent from the holder of the affiliated parent account before allowing the minor to download an app, purchase an app, or make an in-app purchase. Specifically the bill requires app store providers to: (1) request age information from an individual located in the State when the individual creates an account with the app store provider and verify the individuals age category;  (2) if the age verification method determines the individual is a minor, require the account to be affiliated with a parent account and obtain verifiable parental consent from the holder of the affiliated parent account before the minor can download an app, purchase an app, or make an in-app purchase; (3) after receiving notice of a significant change, as defined in this bill, from the developer, notify the user of the significant change and for a minor account, notify the holder of the affiliated parent account and obtain renewed verifiable parental consent; (4) provide certain information to a developer as required under this bill; (5) notify a developer when a parent or guardian revokes parental consent; and (6) protect personal age verification data by various methods provided in the bill. Additionally, the bill requires developers to: (1) verify the age category of users located in the State and for a minor account  verify whether verifiable parental consent has been obtained; (2) notify app store providers of a significant change to the app; (3) use age category data received from an app store provider to enforce any developer-created age-related restrictions, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and implement any developer-created safety-related features or defaults; and (4) request personal age verification data or parental consent, at the time a user downloads an app or purchases an app, when implementing a significant change to the app, or to comply with applicable laws or regulations.  The bill authorizes developers to request personal age verification data or parental consent: (1) no more than once during each 12-month period, (2) when there is reasonable suspicion of account transfer or misuse outside the verified age category, or (3) when a user creates a new account with the developer. Under the bill, if an app store provider of a developer violates the bill, it is a violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. Additionally, bill permits a minor, or parent or guardian of a minor, who has been harmed by a violation of certain provisions on the bill to bring an action in the Superior Court against an app store provider or a developer.  If the suit is successful, an individual would be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and court costs.  An individual would also be entitled to up to the greater of actual damages or $1,000 for each violation. The bill includes a provision that includes circumstances under which developers would not be liable for a violation of the bill.
