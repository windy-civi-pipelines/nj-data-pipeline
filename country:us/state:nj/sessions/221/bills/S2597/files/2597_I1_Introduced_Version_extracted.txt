Nothing in this section shall be construed to exclude a licensed health care service firm that is approved to provide private duty nursing under the Medicaid Program and is in compliance with State Board of Education regulations.  The parent or legal guardian of a medically fragile student shall have the option to choose a provider to render clinical nursing services to the student, and the State Board of Education shall allow the provider chosen by the parent or legal guardian to render such services to the student only if the cost to the school district remains neutral. As used in this subsection: ["Medically fragile student" means a school-aged child who suffers from a life-threatening medical condition, and as a result of such condition, requires more individualized and continuous care than is available from a school nurse.] "Clinical nursing services" means specific health care services, based on a medically fragile student's individualized education plan and a physician's or advanced practice nurse's orders, as provided by a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse with specialized pediatric training who attends to the student. "Medically fragile student" means a school-aged child who suffers from a life-threatening medical condition, and as a result of such condition, requires more individualized and continuous care than is available from a school nurse. "Provider of clinical nursing services" means an agency that renders clinical nursing services and is approved to provide private duty nursing under the Medicaid program pursuant to P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.) or the NJ FamilyCare Program pursuant to P.L.2005, c.156 (C.30:4J-8 et al.). (cf: P.L.2012, c.5, s.2) 2.    Section 4 of P.L.1999, c.153 (C.18A:40-3.5) is amended to read as follows: 4.    The holder of a valid New Jersey registered nurse license or a multistate license issued pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2019, c.172 (C.45:11A-9 et seq.) may be issued a county substitute certificate to serve as a substitute for a certified school nurse in accordance with [N.J.A.C.6:11-4.5] regulations promulgated by the State Board of Education.  Emergency certificates may be issued in accordance with [N.J.A.C.6:11-4.3] regulations promulgated by the State board.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.70, s.1) 4.    Section 2 of P.L.2017, c.70 (C.18A:40-3.8) is amended to read as follows: 2.    State Board of Education regulations prescribing the requirements for eligibility for an educational services certificate with a school nurse/non-instructional endorsement shall, at a minimum, require that a candidate for the endorsement: a.     is licensed as a registered nurse pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1947, c.262 (C.45:11-23 et seq.) or P.L.2019, c.172 (C.45:11A-9 et seq.); b.    holds a bachelor's degree from a regionally-accredited college or university; and c.     completes either a Department of Education-approved college curriculum for the preparation of school nurses or a program of studies, with a minimum of 15 semester hour credits, that includes study in the fundamentals of substance abuse and dependency and such other subject areas as determined by the State board, and clinical experience in a school nurse office. (cf: P.L.2017, c.70, s.2) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill permits registered nurses holding a nursing multistate license to be eligible for an educational services certificate with a school nurse endorsement, a school nurse/non-instructional endorsement, and a substitute school nurse/non-instructional credential. P.L.2019, c.172 (C.45:11A-9 et seq.) entered the State into the enhanced multistate Nurse Licensure Compact (eNCL).  The eNLC provides for a mutual recognition model of nurse licensure in which a nurse needs to obtain one license from the nurse's state of residence in order to be permitted to practice nursing in any other state that is a party to the compact, as long as the nurse complies with the state practice laws of the state in which the patient is located at the time that care is rendered. This bill amends current law to permit a nurse holding a multistate license through the eNCL to be eligible for an educational services certificate with a school nurse endorsement, a school nurse/non-instructional endorsement, and a substitute school nurse/non-instructional credential.
