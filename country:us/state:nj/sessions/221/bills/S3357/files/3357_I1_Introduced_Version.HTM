(2) an artificial system developed in computer software, physical hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical action; (3) an artificial system designed to think or act like a human, including cognitive architectures and neural networks; (4) a set of techniques, including machine learning, that is designed to approximate a cognitive task; or (5) an artificial system designed to act rationally, including an intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating, decision making, and acting. State agency means any of the principal departments in the Executive Branch of the State Government, and any division, board, bureau, office, commission, or other instrumentality within or created by such department;

b.  identify advantages and disadvantages of State agencies procuring, developing, and implementing artificial intelligence; c.  recommend guidelines for State agencies to safely and ethically procure, develop, and implement artificial intelligence; d.  develop strategies to deliver and support artificial intelligence and other similar emerging technologies; and e.  review automated decision systems used by State agencies for ethical concerns. 3.  The council shall issue a final written report of its findings and recommendations made pursuant to this act to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature no later than one year following the first meeting of the council. 4.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire upon the councils submission of its report pursuant to section 3 of this act.
