for certain students, and supplementing P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.),
chapter 4 of Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes, and Title 18A of the New
Jersey Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known
and may be cited as the Opportunity Scholarship Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     <span style='background:
white'>Parents of limited financial resources are often less able to provide
access to quality educational options for their children and are therefore
unable to select the learning environment that might best meet the needs of
their children, even in those instances in which the public schools are failing
to educate their children</span>;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Consequently, it is
critical to provide a mechanism that will provide children of families that
have limited financial resources enrolled in chronically failing schools the
opportunity to enroll in different schools chosen by their parents so as to
expand the educational opportunities available to these children;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The United States
Supreme Court in its 2002 decision, Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, found that a
program providing tuition aid in the form of scholarships for some students to
attend public or nonpublic schools of a parents choosing did not violate the
Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Accordingly, it<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'> </span></b>is appropriate
that the State initiate a tax credit scholarship program on a pilot basis to
encourage taxpayers to make voluntary contributions to a nonprofit scholarship
organization, as well as to assess the impact of such a program on the
educational opportunity and achievement of children whose current education
options are limited to a chronically failing school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in sections 1
through 11 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as
this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Chronically failing school
means any public school, other than a charter school, that is located in a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   among all students in
that school to whom a State assessment was administered, the sum of the percent
of students scoring in the not-yet-meeting expectations and partially meeting

two school years; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   among all students in
that school to whom a State assessment was administered, the sum of the percent
of students scoring in the not-yet-meeting expectations and partially meeting

two school years.</p>

students scoring in the not-yet-meeting expectations and partially meeting
expectations categories in both the language arts and mathematics subject areas
of the State assessments is less than or equal to the sum of the Statewide
percent of students scoring in the not-yet-meeting expectations and partially
meeting expectations categories on the corresponding Statewide assessments.</span></p>

by the eligible school and does not discriminate in its admission policies or
practices for scholarship students enrolled in a public school on the date of
the scholarship application on the basis of intellectual or athletic ability,
measures of achievement or aptitude, status as a person with disabilities,
proficiency in the English language, or any other basis that would be illegal
if used by a school district; however, nothing shall prohibit a school from
qualifying as an eligible school solely because the school limits admission to
a particular grade level, single gender, or to areas of concentration at the
school, such as mathematics, science, or the arts.  Nothing in this paragraph
shall be construed to require a school to implement new academic or other
programs that the school does not offer at the time that, in the case of a
public school, the board of education designates it as a school that will
accept scholarship students, or, in the case of a nonpublic school, the school
obtains approval from the commissioner to be deemed an eligible school;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   provides instruction in

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill directs the Director
of the Division of Taxation to establish a five-year pilot program to provide
tax credits to taxpayers that make contributions to a selected scholarship
organization that provides scholarships to certain low-income children to
attend a nonpublic school or an out-of-district public school.  The program
would allow a taxpayer to claim a tax credit against the corporate business tax
or gross income tax equal to 100% of any contribution made to the scholarship
organization; in the case of the gross income tax credit, a taxpayer must
contribute a minimum of $100 to the scholarship organization in order to be
eligible to receive the tax credit.  The maximum amount of tax credits allowable
in each State fiscal year would equal 120% of the total value of scholarships
awarded and administrative fees collected from school districts.  Tax credits
would be allowed in the order in which the contributions are received.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill creates the
Opportunity Scholarship Board and directs it to select one scholarship
organization to administer the program. The scholarship organization would
receive contributions made to the program and award scholarships to the parents
or guardians of eligible students.  The maximum number of scholarships that may
be awarded each year is: 2,500 in the first year, 5,000 in the second year,
7,500 in the third year, and 10,000 in the fourth and fifth years.  The number
of available scholarships would be allocated to each targeted district based on
the number of students enrolled in the districts chronically failing school
relative to the enrollment in chronically failing schools located in targeted
districts.  If the number of eligible students applying for a scholarship
exceeds the number of available scholarships in a targeted district, then the
scholarship organization would be responsible for conducting a lottery to
determine scholarship awards in that district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To be eligible to receive a
scholarship, a low-income child must either: 1) attend a chronically failing
school, 2) have received a scholarship in the previous school year and continue
to reside in the targeted district, 3) reside in a targeted district and attend
one of the districts public schools that is not a chronically failing school,
or 4) in the subsequent school year, would be eligible to enroll in a
chronically failing school in the lowest grade, other than preschool, operated
by the school.  The last category of students would include those currently
enrolled in a nonpublic school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines a chronically
failing school as one in which, for the past two school years: at least 40% of
the schools students did not pass both the language arts and mathematics
subject areas of the State assessments, or at least 60% of the students did not
pass either the language arts or mathematics subject areas.  Additionally, the
school must be located in one of eight targeted districts: Asbury Park, Camden,
 Elizabeth, Lakewood, Newark, Orange, Passaic, or Perth Amboy.  A child is
considered low-income if the child lives in a household in which the income
does not exceed 250% of the federal poverty threshold.  Scholarships would be
awarded to eligible students in the following order or priority: 1) low-income children
either attending a chronically failing school or eligible to enroll in a
chronically failing school in the next school year, and 2) children who attend
a public school, other than a chronically failing school, in a targeted
district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The scholarship organization
selected under the bill must require that an eligible school which admits a
child receiving a scholarship under the pilot program:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   does not require a
parent or guardian to make a payment in addition to the scholarship for a
childs attendance at the school;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   ensures that a child
enrolled in an eligible school who received a scholarship under the program in
the prior school year receives a scholarship in each school year of enrollment
under the program provided that the child continues to reside in the targeted
district;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   in the event that more
children apply for admission to that school under the pilot program than there
are openings, selects scholarship students through a lottery; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   within the first 30 days
of a scholarship students enrollment in the school, and once each year
thereafter, administers a grade-level appropriate assessment to all scholarship
students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, if the eligible
school is a nonpublic school, the scholarship organization must also require
that the school:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   administer the
appropriate grade level State assessment to scholarship students, and make the
results publicly available;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   agree to continue
enrolling a scholarship student for two school years, unless the student
commits an act that threatens the health or safety of other students, faculty,
or staff; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   obtain written
acknowledgment from the parent or guardian that notification has been received
that a nonpublic school may not provide the same level of special education
instructional programs and support services that may be available in a public
school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Additionally, if the nonpublic
school is a sectarian school, it must provide a scholarship student the
opportunity to opt out of any religious instruction or activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of public schools,
eligible schools will be those schools designated by the board of education to
accept students who participate in the program.  In the case of nonpublic
schools, eligible schools will include those approved by the Commissioner of
Education to accept students who participate in the program.  The commissioner
will develop a process for providing such approval.  The commissioner is
required to grant approval to a nonpublic school if it: 1) has been in
operation for at least five years and has an end of year financial statement
for each of the previous five years; 2) was founded within the prior 12 months
by an operator of an existing school that meets the first criteria; or 3) is a
current member of the New Jersey Association of Independent Schools.  The
commissioner may approve a school that does not meet the previous requirements
if the school submits an application that includes information regarding: 1)
the schools objectives and strategy for meeting those objectives; 2) a
demonstration of the schools financial viability; 3) a list of faculty,
including the individuals educational attainment and relevant work experience;
4) a statement regarding the adequacy of the schools facilities and equipment;
5) documentation that the school is a qualified nonprofit entity; and 6) a list
of board members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The scholarship organization
would have a number of program responsibilities, including managing the
application process in each district, verifying applicants eligibility to
receive a scholarship, maintaining an inventory of vacancies in eligible
schools, conducting any necessary lotteries to determine scholarship awards,
monitoring the enrollment of scholarship students, and managing the acceptance
of contributions made to the program.  Additionally, the scholarship
organization must prepare an annual report, to be submitted to the State
Treasurer, Commissioner of Education, and the scholarship board, enter into a
contract with an independent entity to conduct an annual audit, and commission
an independent study of the pilot program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The scholarship organization
may apply to the Opportunity Scholarship Board to amend programmatic procedures
as necessary to ensure the effective and efficient administration of the
programs.  Amendments that may be considered may include, but need not be
limited to, the administration of the tax credits, the need to conduct
lotteries, and reporting requirements related to the independent evaluation of
the pilot program.  The board may not approve any amendments that would
materially alter the goals and objectives of the pilot program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For each resident student who
receives a scholarship, a targeted districts State aid will be reduced by an
amount equal to the scholarship awarded to the student plus the scholarship
organizations administrative fee.  The administrative fee will equal $750 per scholarship
in the first year, $400 per scholarship in the second year, $250 per
scholarship in the third year, $200 per scholarship in the fourth year, and
$210 per scholarship in the final year.  The targeted district would also be
responsible for providing transportation services to a scholarship student outside
of the district on the same basis that the district provides transportation
services to nonpublic school students pursuant to N.J.S.18A:39-1.</p>
