Nothing contained in this subsection shall prohibit the owner of an autocab from obtaining any additional amount of motor vehicle liability insurance coverage from a company licensed outside the State of New Jersey. The consent shall be effective and operation thereunder shall be permitted only so long as the insurance policy shall remain in force to the full and collectible amounts as aforesaid. The insurance policy shall provide for the payment of any final judgment recovered by any person on account of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the autocab or any fault in respect thereto, and shall be for the benefit of every person suffering loss, damage or injury as aforesaid; and b.    Each operator or driver of the autocab for which the owner thereof is seeking the consent to operate in a municipality has submitted to the performance of a criminal history record background check.  The cost for the criminal history record background check, including all costs of administering and processing the check, shall be borne by the operator or driver of the autocab.

If a person who has been convicted of one of the crimes enumerated in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection can produce a certificate of rehabilitation issued pursuant to N.J.S.2A:168A-8 or, if the criminal offense occurred outside New Jersey, an equivalent certificate from the jurisdiction where the criminal offense occurred, the criminal offense shall not disqualify the applicant from operating or driving an autocab. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to an operator or driver of an autocab who has received the consent to operate in a municipality prior to the effective date of P.L.2011, c.135 (C.48:16-2.1 et al.). (cf: P.L.2023, c.276, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to all automobile insurance policies initiated or renewed on or after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill lowers the motor vehicle liability coverage requirement for autocabs.  Under current law, the owner of an autocab is required to maintain motor vehicle liability coverage of at least $1.5 million to insure against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death, and property damage.  Under the bill, the owner of an autocab is required to maintain motor vehicle liability coverage of at least $200,000.
