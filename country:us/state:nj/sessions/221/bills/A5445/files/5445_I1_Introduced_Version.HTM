<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1968, c.385
(C.17:28-1.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  Except for a basic
automobile insurance policy, no motor vehicle liability policy or renewal of
such policy of insurance, including a standard liability policy for an
automobile as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2), insuring
against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or
death, sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use
of a motor vehicle, shall be issued in this State with respect to any motor
vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State unless it includes
coverage in limits for bodily injury or death as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   an amount or limit of
$15,000 for plans issued or renewed prior to January 1, 2023, $25,000 for plans
issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2023 but prior to January 1, 2026, and
$35,000 for plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, exclusive of
interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one person, in any
one accident, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   an amount or limit,
subject to such limit for any one person so injured or killed, of  $30,000 for
plans issued or renewed prior to January 1, 2023, $50,000 for plans issued or
renewed on or after January 1, 2023 but prior to January 1, 2026, and $70,000
for plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, exclusive of interest
and costs, on account of injury to or death of more than one person, in any one
accident, under provisions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and
Insurance, for payment of all or part of the sums which the insured or his
legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the
operator or owner of an uninsured motor vehicle, underinsured motor vehicle, or
hit and run motor vehicle, as defined in section 18 of P.L.1952, c.174
(C.39:6-78), because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death
resulting therefrom, sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising
out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of such uninsured, underinsured
or hit and run motor vehicle anywhere within the United States or Canada;
except that uninsured motorist coverage shall provide that in order to recover
for non-economic loss, as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2),
for accidents to which the benefits of section 4 (C.39:6A-4) of that act apply,
the tort option elected pursuant to section 8 (C.39:6A-8) of that act shall
apply to that injured person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All motor vehicle liability
policies, except basic automobile insurance policies, shall also include
coverage for the payment of all or part of the sums which persons insured
thereunder shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from owners or
operators of uninsured and underinsured motor vehicles, other than hit and run
motor vehicles, because of injury to or destruction to the personal property of
such insured, with a limit in the aggregate for all insurers involved in any
one accident of $25,000 for plans issued or renewed on or after January 1,
2023, and subject, for each insured, to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of
such damages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage shall be provided, as an option by an insurer to
the named insured electing a standard automobile insurance policy, up to at
least the following limits: $250,000.00 each person and $500,000.00 each
accident for bodily injury; $100,000.00 each accident for property damage or
$500,000.00 single limit, subject to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such
damage to property for each accident, except that the limits for uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage shall not exceed the insured's motor vehicle
liability policy limits for bodily injury and property damage, respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Rates for uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage for the same limits shall, for each filer, be
uniform on a Statewide basis without regard to classification or territory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage provided for in this section shall not be
increased by stacking the limits of coverage of multiple motor vehicles covered
under the same policy of insurance nor shall these coverages be increased by
stacking the limits of coverage of multiple policies available to the insured. 
If the insured had uninsured motorist coverage available under more than one
policy, any recovery shall not exceed the higher of the applicable limits of
the respective coverages and the recovery shall be prorated between the
applicable coverages as the limits of each coverage bear to the total of the
limits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage shall be subject to the policy terms, conditions
and exclusions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance,
including, but not limited to, unauthorized settlements, non-duplication of
coverage, subrogation and arbitration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     For the purpose of this
section, (1) &quot;underinsured motorist coverage&quot; means insurance for
damages because of bodily injury and property damage resulting from an accident
arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an underinsured
motor vehicle.  Underinsured motorist coverage shall not apply to an uninsured
motor vehicle.  A motor vehicle is underinsured when the sum of the limits of
liability under all bodily injury and property damage liability bonds and
insurance policies available to a person against whom recovery is sought for
bodily injury or property damage is, at the time of the accident, less than the
applicable limits for underinsured motorist coverage afforded under the motor
vehicle insurance policy held by the person seeking that recovery.  A motor
vehicle shall not be considered an underinsured motor vehicle under this
section unless the limits of all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds
applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of
settlements or judgments.  The limits of underinsured motorist coverage
available to an injured person shall be reduced by the amount he has recovered
under all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   &quot;uninsured motor
vehicle&quot; means:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   a motor vehicle with
respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of which there is no
bodily injury liability insurance or bond applicable at the time of the
accident;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   a motor vehicle with
respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of which there is
bodily injury liability insurance in existence but the liability insurer denies
coverage or is unable to make payment with respect to the legal liability of
its insured because the insurer has become insolvent or bankrupt, or the
Commissioner of Banking and Insurance has undertaken control of the insurer for
the purpose of liquidation;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   a hit and run motor
vehicle as described in section 18 of P.L.1952, c.174 (C.39:6-78); or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   an automobile covered by
a special automobile insurance policy pursuant to section 45 of P.L.2003, c.89
(C.39:6A-3.3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Uninsured motor
vehicle&quot; shall not include an automobile covered by a basic automobile
insurance policy; an underinsured motor vehicle; a motor vehicle owned by or
furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any resident of the same
household; a self-insurer within the meaning of any financial responsibility or
similar law of the state in which the motor vehicle is registered or
principally garaged; a motor vehicle which is owned by the United States or
Canada, or a state, political subdivision or agency of those governments or any
of the foregoing; a land motor vehicle or trailer operated on rails or crawler
treads; a motor vehicle used as a residence or stationary structure and not as
a vehicle; or equipment or vehicles designed for use principally off public
roads, except while actually upon public roads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Notwithstanding the
provisions of this section or any other law to the contrary, a motor vehicle
liability policy or renewal of such policy of insurance, insuring against loss
resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death, sustained
by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor
vehicle, issued in this State to a corporate or business entity with respect to
any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State, shall not
provide less uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for an individual
employed by the corporate or business entity than the coverage provided to the
named insured under the policy.  A policy that names a corporate or business
entity as a named insured shall be deemed to provide the maximum uninsured or
underinsured motorist coverage available under the policy to an individual
employed by the corporate or business entity, regardless of whether the
individual is an additional named insured under that policy or is a named
insured or is covered under any other policy providing uninsured or
underinsured motorist coverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>g.    An automobile
insurance policy shall not disclaim uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage
based on the insureds operation, maintenance, or use, for the business
purposes of the insureds employer, of a motor vehicle that is owned by the
insureds employer.  This prohibition against disclaimer shall apply even if
the insured regularly uses the employers motor vehicle.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    This act shall take
effect immediately and apply to automobile insurance policies issued or renewed
after that date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill prohibits an
automobile insurance policy from disclaiming uninsured or underinsured motorist
coverage based on the insureds operation, maintenance, or use, for the
business purposes of the insureds employer, of a motor vehicle that is owned
by the insureds employer.  The prohibition against disclaimer applies even if
the insured regularly uses the employers motor vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is a response to multiple
case law decisions, including <u>Venters v. Selected Risks Insurance Company</u>,
<u>Edouard v. GEICO</u>, and <u>Siemietkoski v. Velasquez-Flores</u>.  Those
cases allow insurers to deny coverage, preventing insureds from recovering
against their uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage when injured in a
motor vehicle accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver while using an
employers vehicle.</p>
