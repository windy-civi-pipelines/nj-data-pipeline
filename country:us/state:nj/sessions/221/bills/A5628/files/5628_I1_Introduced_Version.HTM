A5628 ASSEMBLY, No. 5628 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 8, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ROSAURA "ROSY" BAGOLIE District 27 (Essex and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Directs State Board of Education to authorize issuance of revised military science endorsement. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning endorsements to teaching certificates and supplementing chapter 26 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.         As used in this section, military science means instruction authorized pursuant to the Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps established pursuant to 10 U.S.C. s.2031. b.    The State Board of Education shall authorize a revised military science endorsement to the standard certificate.  The endorsement shall authorize the holder to teach military science to students in grades nine through 12. c.     In order to be eligible for the military science endorsement established pursuant to subsection b. of this section, a candidate shall: (1)   document 10 years of military service; and (2)   hold a valid certification authorizing employment as a military science instructor from the branch of service in which the candidate served. d.    To retain this endorsement, the holder shall maintain the authorization required pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection c. of this section. 2.    The State Board of Education shall adopt, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations as necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill directs the State Board of Education to authorize the issuance of a revised military science endorsement to the standard certificate. Current State board regulations permit the issuance of a military science endorsement, provided the candidate: 1) documents 20 years of military service; and 2) holds a valid certification authorizing employment as a military science instructor from the branch of service in which the candidate served.  To retain the endorsement, the regulations require the holder to maintain a valid military employment authorization. This bill codifies the regulations, however, it permits a candidate to be eligible upon 10 years of military service instead of 20 years to comply with current practices of the United States Armys and Navys Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) programs. The JROTC program is a federal program that prepares high school students for leadership roles while making them aware of their rights, responsibilities, and privileges as American citizens.  JROTC has traditionally relied on retired military personnel to serve as instructors.  In 2023, the federal National Defense Authorization Act was amended, broadening the eligibility to serve as a JROTC instructor to: 1) separated officers and noncommissioned officers who served honorably for at least eight years; and 2) service members in the reserve component, who meet the time in, service, grade, and education requirements.  Both the United States Armys and Air Forces JROTC require a minimum of 10 years of military service to be eligible as a JROTC instructor.
