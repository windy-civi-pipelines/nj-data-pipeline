animals useful to man, including but not limited to:  forages and sod crops;
grains and feed crops; dairy animals and dairy products; poultry and poultry

which is devoted exclusively to the production for sale of tree and forest
products, other than Christmas trees, or devoted as sustainable forestland, and
is not appurtenant woodland, shall not be deemed to be in agricultural use
unless the landowner fulfills the following additional conditions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The landowner
establishes and complies with the provisions of a forest stewardship plan for
this land, approved by the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.2009, c.256 (C.13:1L-31), or a woodland management plan for

Department of Environmental Protection an exact copy of the application and
accompanying information submitted to the assessor pursuant to this
subsection.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The requirements of
subsections a. through c. of this section shall not apply to the production of
a crop designated as a specialty crop by the United States Department of

not limited to, the production of maple syrup from sap collected from trees
grown and maintained on the forested lands or woodlands.  The landowner
producing a specialty crop on forested land or woodlands shall not be required
to submit a woodland management plan for the forested lands or woodlands as
part of the application for farmland assessment.  The landowner shall annually

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.  a.  Except as otherwise
provided in subsection d. of this section, land, five acres in area, shall be
deemed to be actively devoted to agricultural or horticultural use when the
amount of the gross sales of agricultural or horticultural products produced
thereon, <u>including a crop designated as a specialty crop by the United
States Department of Agriculture,</u> any payments received under a soil
conservation program, fees received for breeding, raising or grazing any
livestock, income imputed to cropland pastured and permanent pasture land used
for grazing in the amount determined by the State Farmland Evaluation Committee
created pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.20), and fees
received for boarding, rehabilitating or training any livestock where the land
under the boarding, rehabilitating or training facilities is contiguous to land
which otherwise qualifies for valuation, assessment and taxation under
P.L.1964, c.48, have averaged at least $1,000 per year during the two-year
period immediately preceding the tax year in issue, or there is clear evidence
of anticipated yearly gross sales, payments, fees, and imputed income amounting
to at least $1,000 within a reasonable period of time, or such amount as may be
established by the State Farmland Evaluation Committee pursuant to this
section.  In the case of woodland subject to a woodland management plan
pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.3), the amount shall be at
least $500, or such amount as may be established by the State Farmland
Evaluation Committee pursuant to this section.  Every three years, or sooner at
the call of the Secretary of Agriculture or the Director of the Division of
Taxation, the State Farmland Evaluation Committee shall review the minimum
gross sales, payments, fees, and imputed income requirements, and anticipated
yearly gross sales, payments, fees, and imputed income requirements,
established in this section for the first five acres, and may, by rule or
regulation adopted pursuant to the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot;
P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), raise the amounts of those minimums to
such levels as the committee determines appropriate.  Any increase made to the
minimum gross sales, payments, fees, and imputed income requirements, and
anticipated yearly gross sales, payments, fees and imputed income requirements,
for the first five acres as authorized pursuant to this section shall not be
enforced until the third tax year following adoption of the increase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, where the land is
more than five acres in area, it shall be deemed to be actively devoted to
agricultural or horticultural use when the amount of the gross sales of
agricultural or horticultural products, <u>including a crop designated as a
specialty crop by the United States Department of Agriculture,</u> produced on
the area above five acres, any payments received under a soil conservation
program, fees received for breeding, raising or grazing any livestock, income

immediately preceding the tax year in issue, or there is clear evidence of
anticipated yearly gross sales, payments, fees, and imputed income amounting to
an average of at least $5.00 per year within a reasonable period of time;
except in the case of woodland and wetland, where the minimum requirement shall
be an average of $0.50 per acre on the area above five acres.</p>

qualified as actively devoted to agricultural or horticultural use under
P.L.1964, c.48, but failing to meet the additional requirement on acreage above
five acres, shall not be subject to the roll-back tax because of such
disqualification, but shall be treated as land for which an annual application

horticultural use.</p>

actively devoted to agricultural or horticultural use as of the day before the
date of enactment of P.L.2013, c.43 (C.54:4-23.3d et al.) due to the use of
payments or other compensation received under a soil conservation program
agreement with any agency of the federal government, but which payments or
other compensation do not meet the minimum amounts required pursuant to
subsection a. of this section as amended by P.L.2013, c.43 (C.54:4-23.3d et
al.), shall continue to be deemed to be actively devoted to agricultural or

P.L.1964, c.48 until the end of the soil conservation program agreement period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In determining the
eligibility of land for valuation, assessment and taxation pursuant to
P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et seq.), the assessor of the taxing district in
which the land is located shall, upon request by the owner of the land, exempt
the owner from the income requirements of this section if the owner
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the assessor that the failure to meet the
income requirements was due to an injury, illness or death of the person
responsible for performing the activities which produce the income necessary to
meet the income eligibility requirement of this section. The request of the
owner shall be accompanied by a certificate of a physician stating that the
person was physically incapacitated or by a certified copy of the death
certificate, as the case may be.  The assessor may only grant an exemption once
for a particular illness, injury or death.</p>

stewardship plan approved by the Department of Environmental Protection
pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2009, c.256 (C.13:1L-31) which is fully
implemented, and (2) otherwise qualifies under the &quot;Farmland Assessment
Act of 1964,&quot; P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et seq.), for valuation,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the Farmland
Assessment Act of 1964, to deem forested land or woodlands to be in
agricultural use when devoted to the production for sale of a crop designated
as a specialty crop by the United States Department of Agriculture, including,
but not limited to, the production of maple syrup from sap collected from trees
grown and maintained on the forested lands or woodlands.  The bill further
exempts the landowner of such lands from the woodland management plan
requirement to receive farmland assessment valuation for such lands.  The bill
does not change the other income and eligibility requirements for farmland
assessment under the current law. </p>
