<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black'>1. 
a. In addition to delivering a voted mail-in ballot by mail or in person as
provided under &quot;The Vote By Mail Law,&quot; P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-1 et
seq.), a mail-in voter shall be entitled to deposit the voter's completed
mail-in ballot in a ballot drop box established by the county board of
elections as provided under this section.  Each mail-in ballot deposited in a
ballot drop box by the time designated under current law for the closing of the
polls for that election shall be considered valid and shall be canvassed.  If,
at the closing of the polls, a voter deposits a mail-in ballot at a ballot drop
box in a county in which the voter does not reside, the county board of
elections, upon discovering that fact, shall notify and timely deliver the
ballot to the county board of elections of the county in which the voter
resides, who shall accept the ballot for processing.  The limitations and
prohibitions applicable to mail-in ballot bearers under &quot;The Vote By Mail
Law,&quot; P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-1 et seq.) shall apply under this section.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black'>b.
(1) For any election, the county board of elections in each county shall
establish ballot drop boxes where voters may deposit their voted mail-in
ballots at least 45 days before the election.  The ballot drop boxes shall be
located throughout the county in a manner specified under paragraph (2) of this
subsection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black'>(2)
(a) A ballot drop box shall mean a secured drop box that is not required to be
within view of a live person for monitoring.  All ballot drop boxes shall be
available for use by a voter 24 hours a day and shall be placed at locations
equipped with security cameras that allow for surveillance of the ballot drop
box.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black'>(b)
Beginning with the 2021 general election, at least one ballot drop box shall be
located: at any county government building in which the main office of the
county clerk is located; in each municipality with a population larger than
5,000 residents; at the main campus of each State college or university; and
the main campus of each independent four-year college or university with
enrollments larger than 5,000 students.  Notwithstanding the locational
criteria established by this subparagraph, whenever two or more ballot drop box
locations are separated by a distance of less than 2,000 feet, the board of elections
in each county shall determine secondary locations for those ballot drop boxes
in compliance with the requirements of this section.  The secondary ballot drop
box locations shall be located within the municipality where those ballot drop
boxes were originally located and shall be approved by a majority vote of the
members of the board of elections.&nbsp; However, in the event of a tie in the
votes cast by the members of the board of elections, the county clerk shall
cast the deciding vote.&nbsp; Whenever possible, at least one ballot drop box
shall be located in a municipality with an average per capita income or a
median family income at or below 250% of the federal poverty guideline
according to the most recent federal American Community Survey.</span></p>

The board of elections in each county shall establish no fewer than 10 ballot
drop boxes.  To the best of their ability, the board of elections of every
county shall place secure ballot drop boxes based on geographic location and
population density to best serve the voters of each county in compliance with
the guidelines adopted pursuant to subsection c. of this section.  The
Secretary of State shall establish guidelines for the placement of the ballot
drop boxes, the security of the ballot drop boxes, and the schedule for ballot
pickup from the ballot boxes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black'>(d)
All ballot drop box locations shall be on sites that meet the accessibility

to the same compliance oversight applicable to polling places under section 3
of P.L.1991, c.429 (C.19:8-3.3).  A ballot drop box site shall be considered
accessible if it is in compliance with the federal &quot;Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990&quot; (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et seq.).</span></p>

The Secretary of State, in consultation with county boards of elections, shall

determining the ballot drop box locations, the secretary and county boards of
elections shall consider, at a minimum, concentrations of population,
geographic areas, voter convenience, proximity to public transportation,
community-based locations, travel time to the location, proximity to other
voting locations and ballot drop boxes, commuter traffic patterns, and
security.  The guidelines shall include, but may not be limited to, criteria
for each county board of elections to:</span></p>

mail-in ballot package sent to each mail-in voter pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2009,
c.79 (C.19:63-7).  At least 45 days before each election, each county board of
elections shall cause to be published on their respective websites the location
