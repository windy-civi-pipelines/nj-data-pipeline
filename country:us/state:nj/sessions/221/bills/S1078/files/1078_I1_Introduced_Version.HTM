<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides for a
reduction in a defendants suspended sentence, sentence of probation, or parole
based on the defendants compliance with the conditions of the sentence.  The
bill also requires studies and annual reports on recidivism that are required
under current law to include data on the effect these reductions have on
recidivism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill is modeled on a
Missouri law which grants a sentence reduction through earned compliance
credits to certain probationers and parolees as a reward for compliance with
the terms of probation or parole.  This law has resulted in an average
reduction of a supervisory sentence by 14 months.  It is the sponsors intent
to provide similar incentives in New Jersey for compliance with the terms of a
suspended sentence or a sentence of probation or parole, and to enable a person
to reenter society more quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, an earlier
discharge from a period of probation may be granted to a defendant on
application of a probation officer, the defendant, or the courts own motion. 
Under the bill, a defendants term of suspension or period of probation will be
reduced as a result of a defendants compliance with the conditions of the suspension
or probation.  The bill provides that the period of suspension or probation will
be reduced by 30 days for each full calendar month the defendant is in
compliance with the conditions of suspension or probation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, the Administrative
Director of the Courts is required to record and analyze data concerning the
recidivism of those sentenced to a period of probation, and prepare and
transmit an annual report on the effectiveness of the State's rehabilitation
initiatives and programs.  This bill requires the Administrative Director also
to consider how a reduction in the period of suspension or probation under the
bill affects recidivism rates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a parolee
may be granted a complete discharge from parole prior to the expiration of the
full maximum term, provided: 1) the parolee has made a satisfactory adjustment
while on parole; 2) that continued supervision is not required; and 3) the
parolee has made full payment of any fine or restitution required.  Under the
bill, a parolee who is in compliance with the terms of supervision also would
be entitled to have the term of supervision reduced by 30 days for each full
calendar month the parolee is in compliance.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
Commissioner of Corrections, in conjunction with the Juvenile Justice
Commission and the State Parole Board, is required to record and analyze
recidivism data and issue an annual report regarding the effectiveness of the
State's reentry initiatives and programs.  The provisions of the bill require
the data and report also to include information on parolees who receive an
earlier discharge under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
person who has been sentenced to a special sentence of community supervision
for life or parole supervision for life; or a parolee who has been convicted of
aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact,
kidnapping pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:13-1, endangering
the welfare of a child by engaging in sexual conduct which would impair or
debauch the morals of the child pursuant to subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:24-4,
endangering the welfare of a child pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), or
subparagraph (a) of paragraph (5) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:24-4; luring or
enticing pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.291 (C.2C:13-6); kidnapping
pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-1, criminal restraint pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-2, or
false imprisonment pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-3 if the victim is a minor and the
offender is not the parent of the victim; knowingly promoting prostitution of a
child pursuant to paragraphs (3) or (4) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:34-1; or
an attempt to commit any of these offenses is not eligible to receive a reduction
in the period of suspension, probation, or parole under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With regard to a reduced term
of suspension or probation under the bill, compliance is defined as the
absence of a violation of a condition of suspension or probation as set forth
in N.J.S.2C:45-1.  With regard to an earlier discharge from parole under the
bill, compliance is defined as the absence of a violation of the conditions
of parole as set forth under subsection b. of section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441
(C.30:4-123.59).  The appropriate board panel shall review a parolees
compliance and eligibility to receive a reduction under this section at least
once every six months.</p>
