class=HangingAnActChar> concerning public health and certain protections for
farm workers, and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=HangingAnAct style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHeading2>     Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  This act
shall be known and may be cited as the Farm Worker Epidemic Health and Safety
Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature hereby
finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The COVID-19 epidemic
has made New Jersey more aware of which populations are more vulnerable to the
spread of communicable disease, with the Department of Health classifying farm
workers, especially migrant farm workers, as being a highly vulnerable
population meriting a high priority in testing and other health services during
epidemics such as the COVID-19 epidemic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Among the many aspects
of their work which make farm workers especially vulnerable to epidemics or
pandemics of communicable disease  are the often close crowding of the workers
in worksites and in farm employer-sponsored or farm employer-authorized
housing, transportation and dining facilities, heightened vulnerability to
respiratory illness caused by exposure to pesticides and fungi, the lack of
health insurance coverage and paid sick days for most of the workers, and limited
access to water, bathrooms and basic sanitation, making it difficult to
implement important preventive measures;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Because of the rapidity
of the spread of communicable disease which may occur under such circumstances,
an outbreak among farm workers can potentially shutter entire farm operations,
not only endangering the health, livelihoods, and even the lives of the
workers, but causing significant immediate disruption of the supply of food and
other agricultural products at a time of great need for them, and potentially
result in serious long-term damage to the viability of the agricultural and
food processing sectors of the States economy;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The potential harm from
outbreaks of epidemic communicable diseases to farm employers and farm workers
is inextricably tied to the great potential danger to public health from
outbreaks of contagious disease among workers who handle food consumed by
members of the general public; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Therefore, preventing
the spread of communicable disease at workplaces in the farm sector is, above
all, a public health goal of the highest importance for the State and all of
its citizens, meriting a major effort of public health officials, farm
employers, and farm workers to ensure that all possible effective actions be taken
towards that goal, including designating farm workers as being among the groups
with the highest priority for testing for communicable disease during declared
emergencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in P.L.    ,
c.     (C.        ) (now pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commissioner means the
Commissioner of Health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Department means the
Department of Health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Farm employer means any
employer who employs one or more farm workers on a farm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Farm worker means any
employee engaged to labor on a farm in the production, harvesting and
processing of agricultural products, and shall include any employee subject to
the provisions of subsection d. of section 5 of P.L.1966, c.113 (C.34:11-56a4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Public health emergency
means an occurrence or imminent threat of an illness or health condition, caused
by bioterrorism, epidemic or pandemic disease, or a novel and highly fatal
infectious agent or biological toxin, that poses a substantial risk of a
significant number of human fatalities or incidents or permanent or long-term
disability, and which has been declared a public health emergency by the
Governor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     State of emergency&quot;
means a natural or human-made disaster or emergency, including an epidemic or
other health emergency, for which a state of emergency has been declared by the
President of the United States, the Governor, a municipal emergency management
coordinator, or other public authority permitted by law to declare a state of
emergency.  If the state of emergency does not apply to the entire State, an
employee shall not be regarded as a covered employee under P.L.    , c.    
(C.        ) (now pending before the Legislature as this bill) unless the
employee is working in the area subject to the state of emergency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    The commissioner shall,
during a public health emergency or state of emergency related to epidemic or
pandemic disease, collaborate with the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce
Development, the Commissioner of Community Affairs, and Commissioner of
Environmental Protection, and the Secretary of Agriculture, and any other heads
of State departments that the commissioner deems appropriate, to establish a
system to ensure that those departments, on a timely basis, share with each
other information regarding violations of public health, environmental, or
labor laws applicable to worksites at farms, migrant labor camps, and other
housing, transportation or dining facilities of farm employers, including the
information from local boards of health and other entities authorized to assist
department inspection or enforcement efforts.  Each commissioner shall maximize
coordination of enforcement efforts by taking into consideration all relevant
information from the system regarding violations of those laws when conducting
inspections of worksites and facilities, making determinations regarding
violations of any of the laws, and imposing the fines or other sanctions for
the violations provided by law to each commissioner.  Each commissioner shall
issue to the Governor, the Legislature and the public a report of enforcement
activities of the department with respect to applicable laws, including
inspections conducted, violations determined, and fines or other sanctions
imposed by the department for the violations or by local authorities in cooperation
with the department.  In the case of the state of emergency <span
style='color:black'>declared by the Governor on March 9, 2020, the reports
shall be issued not later than December 31, 2022.  In the case of any
subsequent </span>public health emergency or state of emergency, the reports
shall be issued not later than 120 days after the end of the emergency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    As part of the
commissioners responsibility to protect the health of the public by regulating
the detection, prevention, and control of communicable, infectious and preventable

Farm Worker Epidemic Health and Safety Act, directs the Commissioner of
Health (commissioner), as part of commissioners responsibility to protect the
health of the public by regulating the detection, prevention, and control of
communicable, infectious and preventable diseases, to utilize the
commissioners powers during a public health emergency or state of emergency
related to epidemic or pandemic disease to do the following with respect to
farm workers and farm employers, as those terms are defined in the bill:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    Designate farm workers

cooperates fully in permitting access to the worksites, facilities, and records
for the inspections and educational activities; implements, and provides
necessary supplies for, good hygiene and infection control practices; does not
direct farm workers to work when sick, and has exposed, infected or symptomatic
farm workers quarantined or separated as directed by public health officials;

rights and responsibilities under the bill and other public health,
environmental, or labor laws applicable to farm employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the

worksites at farms, migrant labor camps, and other housing, transportation or
dining facilities of farm employers, including the information from local

limitations of the HIPAA and that farm employers are required to use test
results to notify potentially exposed employees consistent with the
confidentiality requirements of the ADA and any other applicable laws. </p>
