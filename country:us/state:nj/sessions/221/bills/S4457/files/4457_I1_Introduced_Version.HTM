<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     21.  Section 2 of P.L.2011,
c.145 (C.26:2H-130) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    Pursuant to the
&quot;New Jersey Advance Directives for Health Care Act,&quot; P.L.1991, c.201
(C.26:2H-53 et seq.), this State has statutorily recognized the right of an
adult with decision-making capacity to plan ahead for health care decisions
through the execution of advance directives and designate a surrogate
decision-maker, and to have the wishes expressed in those documents respected,
subject to certain limitations, in order to ensure that the right to control
decisions about one's own health care is not lost if a patient loses
decision-making capacity and is no longer able to participate actively in
making his own health care decisions;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Physician Orders for
Life-Sustaining Treatment or Practitioner Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment,
or POLST, form complements an advance directive by converting a person's wishes
regarding life-sustaining treatment, such as those set forth in an advance
directive, into a medical order;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The POLST form: 
contains immediately actionable, signed medical orders on a standardized form;
includes medical orders that address a range of life-sustaining interventions
as well as the patient's preferred intensity of treatment for each
intervention; is typically a brightly colored, clearly identifiable form; and
is recognized and honored across various health care settings;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The use of a POLST form
is particularly appropriate for persons who have a compromised medical
condition or a terminal illness, and the experience in other states has shown
that the use of the POLST form helps these patients to have their health care
preferences honored by health care providers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.    The use of POLST forms
can overcome many of the problems associated with advance directives, which in
many cases are designed simply to name an individual to make health care
decisions for the patient if the latter becomes incapacitated or otherwise lack
specificity in regard to the patient's health care preferences, and are often
locked away in file drawers or safe deposit boxes and unavailable to health
care providers when the need arises to ensure that the patient's wishes are
followed;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A completed POLST form
is signed by, and more readily available than an advance directive to, the
patient's attending physician, physician <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>assistant<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>associate</u>,
or advanced practice nurse, and provides a specific and detailed set of
instructions for a health care professional or health care institution to
follow in regard to the patient's preference for the use of various medical
interventions;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    To date, at least the
following states, or communities within these states, have established programs
providing for the use of the POLST form that have been endorsed by the National
POLST Paradigm Task Force or are in the process of developing such programs: 
Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The right and preference
of New Jerseyans to have their health care preferences respected would be
better served by the use of the POLST form in this State to augment the use of
advance directives, and the enactment of <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>this
