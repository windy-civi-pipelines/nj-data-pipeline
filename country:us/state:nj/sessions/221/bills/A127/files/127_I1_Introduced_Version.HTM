finding of child abuse or sexual misconduct; or has ever had a license,
professional license, or certificate suspended, surrendered, or revoked while
allegations of child abuse or sexual misconduct were pending or under
investigation, or due to an adjudication or finding of child abuse or sexual
misconduct. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes penalties
for the provision of false information by an applicant for employment; requires
that current and former employers of an applicant respond to a State employers
or service providers request for information within 20 days of that request;
and allows the State employer or service provider to disqualify an applicant if
the information on that persons application cannot be verified due to a
non-response from a current or prior employer. The bill allows such
disqualification or termination upon an affirmative response or finding of
child abuse or sexual misconduct in an applicants application or employment
history. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under special or emergent
circumstances, the bill allows a State employer or  service provider to employ
or contract with an applicant on a provisional basis for a period not to exceed
90 days pending review of an applicants information, provided the applicant
submitted the information requested and the State employer or service provider
has no adverse knowledge or information pertaining to the applicant. The bill
provides that the application records would not be subject to public disclosure
under the open public records act, and prohibits the State employer or
service provider from entering into any contracts or agreements that would
expunge application records or make it difficult to report findings of child
abuse or sexual misconduct.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires an applicant
for employment and each current employee of a State employer or service
provider who is or will be employed in a position which involves regular
contact with children, to undergo a criminal history record background check as
a condition of prospective or continuing employment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The prospective or current
employee would be permanently disqualified from employment in that position if
the criminal history record background check of that employee or applicant
reveals a record of conviction for any of the following crimes and offenses:
(1) a crime against a child, including endangering the welfare of a child and
child pornography; child molestation; (2) abuse, abandonment or neglect of a
child; (3) endangering the welfare of a person with a developmental disability;
(4) sexual assault, criminal sexual contact or lewdness; (5) murder or
manslaughter; (6) stalking; (7) kidnaping and related offenses including criminal
restraint, false imprisonment, interference with custody, criminal coercion, or
enticing a child into a motor vehicle, structure or isolated area; (8) arson,
or causing or risking widespread injury or damage, which would constitute a
crime of the second degree; (9) aggravated assault, which would constitute a
crime of the second or third degree; (10) robbery, which would constitute a
crime of the first degree; (11) burglary, which would constitute a crime of the
second degree; (12) domestic violence; (13) terroristic threats; and (14) an
attempt or conspiracy to commit any of these crimes or offenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, for crimes and
offenses other than those listed, an employee or applicant may be eligible for
employment if the individual has affirmatively demonstrated clear and
convincing evidence of rehabilitation.</p>

Check  Current and Prospective Employees</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill further requires each
applicant for employment and each current employee of a State employer or
service provider who will be or is employed in a position which involves
regular contact with children to undergo a child abuse record information
check. The State employer or service provider would be required to conduct that
check to determine if an incident of child abuse or neglect has been
substantiated against the prospective or current employee. Under the bill, if a
current or prospective employee refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, the
conduct of a child abuse record information check, the person would be ineligible
for or immediately terminated from employment. The bill provides that a current
employee of a State employer or service provider, or an applicant for
employment, who is or will be employed in a position which involves regular
contact with children, would be permanently disqualified from employment in
that position if the child abuse record information check of that employee or
applicant reveals a record of conviction for child abuse.</p>
