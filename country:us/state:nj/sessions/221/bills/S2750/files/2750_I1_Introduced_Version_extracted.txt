Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the court from granting any other emergency relief it deems necessary. c.     If a respondent is charged with a non-indictable offense pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:29-9 as a result of a violation of a protective order entered pursuant to P.L.2015, c.147 (C.2C:14-13 et al.) or military protective order issued by an appropriate military authority, the contempt proceedings for the non-indictable offense shall be heard in the Superior Court.

Any individual, agency, or court which receives from the Administrative Office of the Courts the records referred to in this section shall keep the records and reports, or parts thereof, confidential and shall not disseminate or disclose such records and reports, or parts thereof; provided that nothing in this section shall prohibit a receiving individual, agency, surrogate or court from disclosing records and reports, or parts thereof, in a manner consistent with and in furtherance of the purpose for which the records and reports or parts thereof were received.

(cf: P.L.2023, c.127, s.5) 5.    Section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-28) is amended as follows: 12.  a.  A victim may file a complaint alleging the commission of an act of domestic violence with the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court in conformity with the Rules of Court.  The court shall not dismiss any complaint or delay disposition of a case because the victim has left the residence to avoid further incidents of domestic violence.  Filing a complaint pursuant to this section shall not prevent the filing of a criminal complaint for the same act. On weekends, holidays and other times when the court is closed, a victim may file a complaint before a judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court or a municipal court judge who shall be assigned to accept complaints and issue emergency, ex parte relief in the form of temporary restraining orders pursuant to this act. A plaintiff may apply for relief under this section in a court having jurisdiction over the place where the alleged act of domestic violence occurred, where the defendant resides, or where the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and the court shall follow the same procedures applicable to other emergency applications.  Criminal complaints filed pursuant to this act shall be investigated and prosecuted in the jurisdiction where the offense is alleged to have occurred.  Contempt complaints filed pursuant to N.J.S.2C:29-9 shall be prosecuted in the county where the contempt is alleged to have been committed and a copy of the contempt complaint shall be forwarded to the court that issued the order alleged to have been violated. b.    The court shall waive any requirement that the petitioner's place of residence appear on the complaint. c. (1) The clerk of the court, or other person designated by the court, shall assist the parties in completing any forms necessary for the filing of a summons, complaint, answer or other pleading. (2)   The plaintiff may provide information concerning firearms to which the defendant has access, including the location of these firearms, if known, on a form to be prescribed by the Administrative Director of the Courts. (3)   Information provided by the plaintiff concerning firearms to which the defendant has access shall be kept confidential and shall not be disseminated or disclosed, provided that nothing in this subsection shall prohibit dissemination or disclosure of this information in a manner consistent with and in furtherance of the purpose for which the information was provided. d.    Summons and complaint forms shall be readily available at the clerk's office, at the municipal courts and at municipal and State police stations. e.     As soon as the domestic violence complaint is filed, both the victim and the abuser shall be advised of any programs or services available for advice and counseling. f.     A plaintiff may seek emergency, ex parte relief in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A municipal court judge or a judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court may enter an ex parte order when necessary to protect the life, health or well-being of a victim on whose behalf the relief is sought. g.    If it appears that the plaintiff is in danger of domestic violence, the judge shall, upon consideration of the plaintiff's domestic violence complaint, order emergency ex parte relief, in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A decision shall be made by the judge regarding the emergency relief forthwith. h.    A judge may issue a temporary restraining order upon sworn testimony or complaint of an applicant who is not physically present, pursuant to court rules, or by a person who represents a person who is physically or mentally incapable of filing personally.  A temporary restraining order may be issued if the judge is satisfied that exigent circumstances exist sufficient to excuse the failure of the applicant to appear personally and that sufficient grounds for granting the application have been shown. The judge shall issue a temporary restraining order, pursuant to court rules, upon complaint of an applicant who is a service member of the New Jersey National Guard or any Reserve Component of the United States Armed Forces serving within the State who is a victim of non-consensual sexual contact who has also received a military protective order, or upon complaint of the Staff Judge Advocate of the New Jersey National Guard or any Reserve Component of the United States Armed Forces serving in the State on behalf of a named victim who is a victim of non-consensual sexual contact who has also received a military protective order. i.     An order for emergency, ex parte relief shall be granted upon good cause shown and shall remain in effect until a judge of the Family Part issues a further order.  Any temporary order hereunder is immediately appealable for a plenary hearing de novo not on the record before any judge of the Family Part of the county in which the plaintiff resides or is sheltered if that judge issued the temporary order or has access to the reasons for the issuance of the temporary order and sets forth in the record the reasons for the modification or dissolution.  The denial of a temporary restraining order by a municipal court judge and subsequent administrative dismissal of the complaint shall not bar the victim from refiling a complaint in the Family Part based on the same incident and receiving an emergency, ex parte hearing de novo not on the record before a Family Part judge, and every denial of relief by a municipal court judge shall so state. j.     Emergency relief may include forbidding the defendant from returning to the scene of the domestic violence, forbidding the defendant from possessing any firearm or other weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, ordering the search for and seizure of any firearm or other weapon at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe the weapon is located and the seizure of any firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun issued to the defendant and any other appropriate relief. If the order requires the surrender of any firearm or other weapon, a law enforcement officer shall accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if necessary, to the scene of the domestic violence or any other location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe any firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant is located, to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any firearm or other weapon, and that the firearm or other weapon is appropriately surrendered in accordance with the order. If the order prohibits the defendant from returning to the scene of domestic violence or any other location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe any firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant is located, any firearm or other weapon located there shall be seized by a law enforcement officer. The order shall include notice to the defendant of the penalties for a violation of any provision of the order, including but not limited to the penalties for contempt of court and unlawful possession of a firearm or other weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5.  Other appropriate relief may include but is not limited to an order directing the possession of any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household and providing that the animal shall not be disposed of prior to entry of a final order pursuant to section 13 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-29). The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and scope of any search and seizure authorized by the order.  The provisions of this subsection prohibiting a defendant from possessing a firearm or other weapon shall not apply to any law enforcement officer while actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States or member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to or from an authorized place of duty. k.    The judge may permit the defendant to return to the scene of the domestic violence to pick up personal belongings and effects but shall, in the order granting relief, restrict the time and duration of such permission and provide for police supervision of such visit. l.     An order granting emergency relief, together with the complaint or complaints, shall immediately be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agency for service on the defendant, and to the police of the municipality in which the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and shall immediately be served upon the defendant by the police, except that an order issued during regular court hours may be forwarded to the sheriff for immediate service upon the defendant in accordance with the Rules of Court.  If personal service cannot be effected upon the defendant, the court may order other appropriate substituted service.  At no time shall the plaintiff be asked or required to serve any order on the defendant. m.   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1994, c.94.) n.    Notice of temporary restraining orders issued pursuant to this section shall be sent by the clerk of the court or other person designated by the court to the appropriate chiefs of police, members of the State Police and any other appropriate law enforcement agency or court. o.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1994, c.94.) p.    Any temporary or final restraining order issued pursuant to this act shall be in effect throughout the State, and shall be enforced by all law enforcement officers. q.    Prior to the issuance of any temporary or final restraining order issued pursuant to this section, the court shall order that a search be made of the domestic violence central registry with regard to the defendant's record. (cf: P.L.2016, c.91, s.2) 6.    Section 1 of P.L.1978, c.95 (C.2C:33-4) is amended to read as follows: 1.    Except as provided in subsection e., a person commits a petty disorderly persons offense if, with purpose to harass another, he: a.     Makes, or causes to be made, one or more communications anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language, or any other manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm; b.    Subjects another to striking, kicking, shoving, or other offensive touching, or threatens to do so; or c.     Engages in any other course of alarming conduct or of repeatedly committed acts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy such other person. A communication under subsection a. may be deemed to have been made either at the place where it originated or at the place where it was received. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2001, c.443). e.     A person commits a crime of the fourth degree if, in committing an offense under this section, he was serving a term of imprisonment or was on parole or probation as the result of a conviction of any indictable offense under the laws of this State, any other state or the United States or he knowingly directs such action to a current or former judge that relates to the performance of the judge's public duties. f.     Engages in conduct after having been notified, in writing or otherwise, while the person was a member of the National Guard, not to engage in such conduct by a commanding officer.

STATEMENT Sexual assault remains a persistent problem in the military despite numerous initiatives to address it. The lack of progress stems from the complexity of the problem of sexual assaults, and it is necessary to develop effective prevention and response programs to increase the reporting of sexual assaults as well as to increase the conviction rates of perpetrators of sexual assault. This bill directs a State court to issue a temporary protective order, in the case of nonconsensual sexual conduct or domestic violence, upon complaint of an applicant who is a service member of the New Jersey National Guard or any Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States serving within the State who is a victim of non-consensual sexual contact who has also received a military protective order, or upon complaint of the Staff Judge Advocate of the New Jersey National Guard or any Reserve Component serving in the State on behalf of a named victim who is a victim of non-consensual sexual contact who has also received a military protective order. The bill makes military protective orders issued by an appropriate military authority effective throughout the State, provides for their enforcement, and        directs the Administrative Office of the Courts to establish and maintain a central registry of all orders of protection issued by an appropriate military authority or a foreign tribunal and all persons who have been charged with a violation of a protective order. The bill makes it a petty disorderly persons offense if, with the purpose to harass another, a person engages in conduct after having been notified, while the person was a member of the National Guard, not to engage in such conduct by a commanding officer. In addition, the bill prohibits any person from obtaining a handgun purchase permit or firearms purchaser identification card who is subject to a restraining order issued pursuant to Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991, a temporary or final domestic violence restraining order issued in another jurisdiction, or a substantially similar order issued by the court of another state, tribe, United States Territory, appropriate military authority, or military tribunal. Under the bill, a person, or the family member of the person, that is participating in a military legal proceeding is to receive unpaid leave from employment to seek legal assistance and remedies and attend and prepare for the proceeding when the proceeding involves domestic or sexual violence. The bill also directs the Adjutant General to provide current and former members of the National Guard who were the victims of sexual assault or sexual harassment while members of the National Guard and who are involved in administrative or New Jersey Code of Military Justice proceedings related to sexual assault or sexual harassment, with financial assistance to fully cover the expenses of traveling to and from and participating in those proceedings. The bill stipulates that a person with an order of protection issued by the court of another state, tribe, United States territory, military tribunal, or military protective order issued by an appropriate military authority to file the order with the clerk of the Superior Court in a judicial vicinage in which the person believes that enforcement may be necessary, and requires the New Jersey National Guard to file a certified copy of any military order of protection with the court in a judicial vicinage in which the person entitled to protection resides or, if the person entitled to protection is not a State resident, in a judicial circuit in which it is believed that enforcement may be necessary. Full-time civilian law enforcement officers employed by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Army Criminal Investigation Division, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, or Air Force Office of Special Investigations, who are empowered to effect an arrest with or without a warrant for violations of the United States Code and who are authorized to carry firearms in the performance of their duties are authorized under the bill to act as an officer for the arrest of offenders against the laws of this State where the person reasonably believes that a crime of the first, second, or third degree is or is about to be committed or attempted in his presence, and where the person reasonably believes that a crime of the fourth degree, relating to criminal sexual contact, harassment, or stalking is or is about to be committed or attempted in his presence on a military installation, or off a military installation by a service member against another person, regardless of whether or not either person was on or off duty at the time of the alleged assault, while that officer is in the performance of official duties. The bill provides that a person subject to military discipline under State law who commits an offense of harassment prohibited under State law will be guilty of that offense in accordance with military discipline and be punished as a court martial may direct. Pursuant to the bill, an application for a claim to the Victims of Crime Compensation Office by a military personnel victim based on a sexual assault by another military personnel will not be denied solely because it was not reported to a superior officer or law enforcement officer at the time of the crime and sets forth factors that will be considered for purposes of determining if a claim of military sexual assault qualifies for compensation. The bill provides that if a report is accepted as a credible allegation of domestic abuse or child abuse or neglect by the Department of Children and Families, the department will collect information concerning the military status of the spouse, intimate partner, parent, or guardian of the child who is the subject of the report and share information about the allegation with the appropriate military authorities in accordance with the memorandum of understanding with the military family advocacy program at a local military installation, with respect to interpersonal violence and child abuse and neglect investigations. The State may, pursuant to the bill, exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the United States over a military installation of the United States Department of Defense located within the State in a matter relating to a violation of federal law or the Uniform Code of Military Justice if certain conditions are met. Lastly, the bill provides that, upon acceptance or relinquishment of the United States by the Governor or any other State official, department, or agency, the State will exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the United States over a military installation of the United States within the State in and over land or lands ceded, in a matter related to a violation of federal or State law, upon any child or juvenile, within the limits and extent of lands so ceded and providing that the State will retain concurrent jurisdiction over a military installation of the United States in certain cases.

On weekends, holidays and other times when the court is closed, a victim may file a complaint before a judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court or a municipal court judge who shall be assigned to accept complaints and issue emergency, ex parte relief in the form of temporary restraining orders pursuant to this act. A plaintiff may apply for relief under this section in a court having jurisdiction over the place where the alleged act of domestic violence occurred, where the defendant resides, or where the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and the court shall follow the same procedures applicable to other emergency applications.  Criminal complaints filed pursuant to this act shall be investigated and prosecuted in the jurisdiction where the offense is alleged to have occurred.  Contempt complaints filed pursuant to N.J.S.2C:29-9 shall be prosecuted in the county where the contempt is alleged to have been committed and a copy of the contempt complaint shall be forwarded to the court that issued the order alleged to have been violated. b.    The court shall waive any requirement that the petitioner's place of residence appear on the complaint. c. (1) The clerk of the court, or other person designated by the court, shall assist the parties in completing any forms necessary for the filing of a summons, complaint, answer or other pleading. (2)   The plaintiff may provide information concerning firearms to which the defendant has access, including the location of these firearms, if known, on a form to be prescribed by the Administrative Director of the Courts. (3)   Information provided by the plaintiff concerning firearms to which the defendant has access shall be kept confidential and shall not be disseminated or disclosed, provided that nothing in this subsection shall prohibit dissemination or disclosure of this information in a manner consistent with and in furtherance of the purpose for which the information was provided. d.    Summons and complaint forms shall be readily available at the clerk's office, at the municipal courts and at municipal and State police stations. e.     As soon as the domestic violence complaint is filed, both the victim and the abuser shall be advised of any programs or services available for advice and counseling. f.     A plaintiff may seek emergency, ex parte relief in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A municipal court judge or a judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court may enter an ex parte order when necessary to protect the life, health or well-being of a victim on whose behalf the relief is sought. g.    If it appears that the plaintiff is in danger of domestic violence, the judge shall, upon consideration of the plaintiff's domestic violence complaint, order emergency ex parte relief, in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A decision shall be made by the judge regarding the emergency relief forthwith. h.    A judge may issue a temporary restraining order upon sworn testimony or complaint of an applicant who is not physically present, pursuant to court rules, or by a person who represents a person who is physically or mentally incapable of filing personally.  A temporary restraining order may be issued if the judge is satisfied that exigent circumstances exist sufficient to excuse the failure of the applicant to appear personally and that sufficient grounds for granting the application have been shown. The judge shall issue a temporary restraining order, pursuant to court rules, upon complaint of an applicant who is a service member of the New Jersey National Guard or any Reserve Component of the United States Armed Forces serving within the State who is a victim of non-consensual sexual contact who has also received a military protective order, or upon complaint of the Staff Judge Advocate of the New Jersey National Guard or any Reserve Component of the United States Armed Forces serving in the State on behalf of a named victim who is a victim of non-consensual sexual contact who has also received a military protective order. i.     An order for emergency, ex parte relief shall be granted upon good cause shown and shall remain in effect until a judge of the Family Part issues a further order.  Any temporary order hereunder is immediately appealable for a plenary hearing de novo not on the record before any judge of the Family Part of the county in which the plaintiff resides or is sheltered if that judge issued the temporary order or has access to the reasons for the issuance of the temporary order and sets forth in the record the reasons for the modification or dissolution.  The denial of a temporary restraining order by a municipal court judge and subsequent administrative dismissal of the complaint shall not bar the victim from refiling a complaint in the Family Part based on the same incident and receiving an emergency, ex parte hearing de novo not on the record before a Family Part judge, and every denial of relief by a municipal court judge shall so state. j.     Emergency relief may include forbidding the defendant from returning to the scene of the domestic violence, forbidding the defendant from possessing any firearm or other weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, ordering the search for and seizure of any firearm or other weapon at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe the weapon is located and the seizure of any firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun issued to the defendant and any other appropriate relief. If the order requires the surrender of any firearm or other weapon, a law enforcement officer shall accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if necessary, to the scene of the domestic violence or any other location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe any firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant is located, to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any firearm or other weapon, and that the firearm or other weapon is appropriately surrendered in accordance with the order.

"Rape Crisis Center" means an office, institution, or center offering assistance to victims of sexual offenses through crisis intervention, medical and legal information, and follow-up counseling. d.    An employer shall display conspicuous notice of its employees' rights and obligations pursuant to the provisions of this act, in such form and in such manner as the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development shall prescribe, and use other appropriate means to keep its employees so informed. e.     No provision of this act shall be construed as requiring or permitting an employer to reduce employment benefits provided by the employer or required by a collective bargaining agreement which are in excess of those required by this act. Nor shall any provision of this act be construed to prohibit the negotiation and provision through collective bargaining agreements of leave policies or benefit programs which provide benefits in excess of those required by this act. This provision shall apply irrespective of the date that a collective bargaining agreement takes effect. Nothing contained in this act shall be construed as permitting an employer to: (1)   rescind or reduce any employment benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave taken pursuant to this act commenced; or (2)   rescind or reduce any employment benefit, unless the rescission or reduction of the benefit is based on changes that would have occurred if an employee continued to work without taking the leave provided pursuant to this section. f.     All information provided to an employer pursuant to subsection c. of this section, and any information regarding a leave taken pursuant to this section and any failure of an employee to return to work, shall be retained in the strictest confidentiality, unless the disclosure is voluntarily authorized in writing by the employee or is required by a federal or State law, rule, or regulation.

STATEMENT Sexual assault remains a persistent problem in the military despite numerous initiatives to address it. The lack of progress stems from the complexity of the problem of sexual assaults, and it is necessary to develop effective prevention and response programs to increase the reporting of sexual assaults as well as to increase the conviction rates of perpetrators of sexual assault. This bill directs a State court to issue a temporary protective order, in the case of nonconsensual sexual conduct or domestic violence, upon complaint of an applicant who is a service member of the New Jersey National Guard or any Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States serving within the State who is a victim of non-consensual sexual contact who has also received a military protective order, or upon complaint of the Staff Judge Advocate of the New Jersey National Guard or any Reserve Component serving in the State on behalf of a named victim who is a victim of non-consensual sexual contact who has also received a military protective order. The bill makes military protective orders issued by an appropriate military authority effective throughout the State, provides for their enforcement, and        directs the Administrative Office of the Courts to establish and maintain a central registry of all orders of protection issued by an appropriate military authority or a foreign tribunal and all persons who have been charged with a violation of a protective order. The bill makes it a petty disorderly persons offense if, with the purpose to harass another, a person engages in conduct after having been notified, while the person was a member of the National Guard, not to engage in such conduct by a commanding officer. In addition, the bill prohibits any person from obtaining a handgun purchase permit or firearms purchaser identification card who is subject to a restraining order issued pursuant to Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991, a temporary or final domestic violence restraining order issued in another jurisdiction, or a substantially similar order issued by the court of another state, tribe, United States Territory, appropriate military authority, or military tribunal. Under the bill, a person, or the family member of the person, that is participating in a military legal proceeding is to receive unpaid leave from employment to seek legal assistance and remedies and attend and prepare for the proceeding when the proceeding involves domestic or sexual violence. The bill also directs the Adjutant General to provide current and former members of the National Guard who were the victims of sexual assault or sexual harassment while members of the National Guard and who are involved in administrative or New Jersey Code of Military Justice proceedings related to sexual assault or sexual harassment, with financial assistance to fully cover the expenses of traveling to and from and participating in those proceedings. The bill stipulates that a person with an order of protection issued by the court of another state, tribe, United States territory, military tribunal, or military protective order issued by an appropriate military authority to file the order with the clerk of the Superior Court in a judicial vicinage in which the person believes that enforcement may be necessary, and requires the New Jersey National Guard to file a certified copy of any military order of protection with the court in a judicial vicinage in which the person entitled to protection resides or, if the person entitled to protection is not a State resident, in a judicial circuit in which it is believed that enforcement may be necessary. Full-time civilian law enforcement officers employed by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Army Criminal Investigation Division, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, or Air Force Office of Special Investigations, who are empowered to effect an arrest with or without a warrant for violations of the United States Code and who are authorized to carry firearms in the performance of their duties are authorized under the bill to act as an officer for the arrest of offenders against the laws of this State where the person reasonably believes that a crime of the first, second, or third degree is or is about to be committed or attempted in his presence, and where the person reasonably believes that a crime of the fourth degree, relating to criminal sexual contact, harassment, or stalking is or is about to be committed or attempted in his presence on a military installation, or off a military installation by a service member against another person, regardless of whether or not either person was on or off duty at the time of the alleged assault, while that officer is in the performance of official duties. The bill provides that a person subject to military discipline under State law who commits an offense of harassment prohibited under State law will be guilty of that offense in accordance with military discipline and be punished as a court martial may direct. Pursuant to the bill, an application for a claim to the Victims of Crime Compensation Office by a military personnel victim based on a sexual assault by another military personnel will not be denied solely because it was not reported to a superior officer or law enforcement officer at the time of the crime and sets forth factors that will be considered for purposes of determining if a claim of military sexual assault qualifies for compensation. The bill provides that if a report is accepted as a credible allegation of domestic abuse or child abuse or neglect by the Department of Children and Families, the department will collect information concerning the military status of the spouse, intimate partner, parent, or guardian of the child who is the subject of the report and share information about the allegation with the appropriate military authorities in accordance with the memorandum of understanding with the military family advocacy program at a local military installation, with respect to interpersonal violence and child abuse and neglect investigations. The State may, pursuant to the bill, exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the United States over a military installation of the United States Department of Defense located within the State in a matter relating to a violation of federal law or the Uniform Code of Military Justice if certain conditions are met. Lastly, the bill provides that, upon acceptance or relinquishment of the United States by the Governor or any other State official, department, or agency, the State will exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the United States over a military installation of the United States within the State in and over land or lands ceded, in a matter related to a violation of federal or State law, upon any child or juvenile, within the limits and extent of lands so ceded and providing that the State will retain concurrent jurisdiction over a military installation of the United States in certain cases.
