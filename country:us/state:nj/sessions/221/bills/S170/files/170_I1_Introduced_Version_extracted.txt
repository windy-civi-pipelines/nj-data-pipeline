This bill also amends current law to replace the name county mosquito extermination commission with county mosquito control commission.  Further, the bill amends various sections of law related to State and county mosquito control commissions to remove references to the terms board of chosen freeholders and chosen freeholder and replace the terms with board of county commissioners and county commissioner, respectively, as required pursuant to State law. Finally, the bill would repeal P.L.1948, c.383 (C.26:9-13.1), which referred to the term of office of original county mosquito extermination commission members at the time the law took effect in 1948.
