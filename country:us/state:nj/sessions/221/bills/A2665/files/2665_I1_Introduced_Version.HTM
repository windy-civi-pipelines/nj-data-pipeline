The Director of the Division of Taxation is authorized to do all things necessary to implement the withholding tax prescribed by this section for taxable year 2018. e.     No additions to tax or penalty shall be imposed under N.J.S.54A:9-6 for insufficient payment of estimated tax that may otherwise be due on salaries, wages and other remuneration received before September 1, 2018, on which there is a rate of tax imposed pursuant to subsections a. and b. of this section. f.     An employer maintaining an office or transacting business within this State and making payment of any salaries, wages and remuneration subject to New Jersey gross income tax or making payment of any remuneration for employment subject to contribution under the New Jersey "unemployment compensation law," pursuant to R.S.43:21-1 et seq., that is subject to New Jersey gross income tax shall not be subject to interest, penalties or other costs that may otherwise be imposed for insufficient withholding of salaries, wages and other remuneration made before September 1, 2018, that is directly attributable to the enactment of the taxable income tables and tax rates in subsections a. and b. of this section. (cf: P.L.2020, c.94, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. STATEMENT This bill re-establishes 6.37 percent as the top gross income tax rate.  Over the last decade, several income tax increases were targeted at the States most productive individuals, families, and small-business owners, causing many within that same tax base to relocate their residence out-of-State. The bill re-establishes the top gross income tax rate to 2004 levels as an initial step toward retaining the talents and contributions of some of the States most productive citizens.

The Director of the Division of Taxation is authorized to do all things necessary to implement the withholding tax prescribed by this section for taxable year 2018. e.     No additions to tax or penalty shall be imposed under N.J.S.54A:9-6 for insufficient payment of estimated tax that may otherwise be due on salaries, wages and other remuneration received before September 1, 2018, on which there is a rate of tax imposed pursuant to subsections a. and b. of this section. f.     An employer maintaining an office or transacting business within this State and making payment of any salaries, wages and remuneration subject to New Jersey gross income tax or making payment of any remuneration for employment subject to contribution under the New Jersey "unemployment compensation law," pursuant to R.S.43:21-1 et seq., that is subject to New Jersey gross income tax shall not be subject to interest, penalties or other costs that may otherwise be imposed for insufficient withholding of salaries, wages and other remuneration made before September 1, 2018, that is directly attributable to the enactment of the taxable income tables and tax rates in subsections a. and b. of this section.

STATEMENT This bill re-establishes 6.37 percent as the top gross income tax rate.  Over the last decade, several income tax increases were targeted at the States most productive individuals, families, and small-business owners, causing many within that same tax base to relocate their residence out-of-State. The bill re-establishes the top gross income tax rate to 2004 levels as an initial step toward retaining the talents and contributions of some of the States most productive citizens.
