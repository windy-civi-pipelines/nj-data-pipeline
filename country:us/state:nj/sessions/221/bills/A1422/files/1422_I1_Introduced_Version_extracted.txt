or (2) by mailing the notice to that person at the person's usual or last known place of residence, or to the address given on the collar, harness or microchip identification. d.    [A] Except as provided pursuant to subsection m. of this section, a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound receiving an animal from a certified animal control officer pursuant to subsection a. of this section, or from any other individual, group, or organization, shall hold the animal for at least seven days before offering it for adoption, [or] euthanizing, relocating, or sterilizing the animal, [except if] unless: (1)   the animal is surrendered voluntarily by its owner to the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound, in which case the provisions of subsection e. of this section shall apply; or (2)   the animal is suspected of being rabid, in which case the provisions of subsection j. of this section shall apply. e.     If a shelter, pound or kennel operating as a shelter or pound is not required to hold an animal for at least seven days pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection d. or subsection m. of this section, the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound: (1)   shall offer the animal for adoption for at least seven days [before euthanizing it];

(2)   may, in the case of a cat or dog, charge the cost of sterilizing the cat or dog, if the owner requests such sterilizing when claiming it; and (3)   may require the owner or person charged with the care of the animal to pay all the animal's expenses while in the care of the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound, not to exceed $4 per day. h.    If the animal remains unclaimed, is not claimed due to the failure of the owner or other person to comply with the requirements of this section, or is not adopted after seven days after the date on which notice is served pursuant to subsection c. of this section or, if no notice can be served, not less than seven days after the date on which the animal was impounded, the impounded animal may be placed in a foster home[,] or transferred to another shelter, pound, kennel operating as a shelter or pound, or animal rescue organization facility[, or euthanized in a manner causing as little pain as possible and consistent with the provisions of R.S.4:22-19]. i.     At the time of adoption, the right of ownership in the animal shall transfer to the new owner.  No dog or other animal taken into custody, impounded, sent or otherwise brought to a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound shall be sold or otherwise be made available for the purpose of experimentation.  Any person who sells or otherwise makes available any such dog or other animal for the purpose of experimentation shall be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. j.     Any animal seized under this section suspected of being rabid shall be immediately reported to the executive officer of the local board of health and to the Department of Health, and shall be quarantined, observed, and otherwise handled and dealt with as appropriate for an animal suspected of being rabid or as required by the Department of Health for the animals. k.    When a certified animal control officer takes into custody and impounds, or causes to be taken into custody and impounded, an animal, the certified animal control officer may place the animal in the custody of, or cause the animal to be placed in the custody of, only a licensed shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound.  The certified animal control officer may not place the animal in the custody of, or cause the animal to be placed in the custody of, any animal rescue organization facility, foster home, or other unlicensed facility. However, the licensed shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound may place the animal in an animal rescue organization facility, foster home, or other unlicensed facility if necessary pursuant to subsection e. or h. of this section. l.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and sections 3 and 4 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and C.4:19-15.31) to the contrary, no cat or dog being transferred between shelters, pounds, or kennels operating as shelters or pounds, or being transferred to an animal rescue organization facility or placed in a foster home, shall be required to be sterilized prior to that transfer. m.   No shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound may euthanize an animal, except: (1)   when the health of the animal, as determined by a licensed veterinarian, necessitates that the animal be euthanized; or (2)   for the safety of the animal, other animals in the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound, or the employees at the facility, it is necessary to euthanize the animal, as determined by the owner or operator of the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound. If it is necessary to euthanize the animal pursuant to this subsection, the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound shall do so in a humane manner consistent with the provisions of R.S.4:22-19. Compliance with Department of Health requirements concerning any animal suspected of being rabid shall supersede any provision of this subsection, and the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound shall comply with the provisions of subsection j. of this section. (cf: P.L.2012, c.17, s.7) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill prohibits euthanizing animals in shelters or pounds for any reason other than health or safety reasons, and requires any necessary euthanizing to be done in a humane manner consistent with current law.  The bill also provides that any Department of Health requirements concerning an animal suspected of being rabid would supersede the provisions limiting euthanasia for impounded animals established in the bill.
