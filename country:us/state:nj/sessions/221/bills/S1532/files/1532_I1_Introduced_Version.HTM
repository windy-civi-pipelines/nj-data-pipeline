(cf: P.L.2009, c.197, s.2) 2.    Section 3 of P.L.2009, c.197 (C.18A:3B-45) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  The [Commission on] Secretary of Higher Education shall issue guidelines and criteria for collecting and calculating the information required pursuant to section 2 of this act and shall prescribe a uniform reporting method for posting the information. b.    The [Commission on] Secretary of Higher Education shall annually compile the student consumer information reports submitted pursuant to subsection c. of section 2 of this act into a comparative profile of all four-year public institutions of higher education and proprietary schools authorized to offer licensed degree programs.  The [commission] secretary shall present the information on its website in a manner that allows college students and their families to easily compare student consumer information across institutions and schools. (cf: P.L. 2009, c.197, s.3) 3.    (New section)  a.  A proprietary school which has been authorized to offer licensed degree programs shall not be eligible to receive direct State aid. b.    A student enrolled in a proprietary school authorized to offer licensed degree programs shall not be eligible to receive any form of student assistance from the State, including grants and scholarships, unless the proprietary school meets a specified graduation rate to be determined by the Secretary of Higher Education. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT According to a December 2010 report of the Education Trust, only one in five students who enrolls in a proprietary school graduates within six years and these students are likely to assume greater levels of student loan debt than students at public and independent colleges.  The study reported that the median debt load for graduates at proprietary schools is $31,190, nearly twice the amount for graduates of independent colleges and four times the amount for graduates of public colleges. This bill prohibits proprietary schools from receiving direct State aid.  The bill further provides that a student enrolled in a proprietary school will not be eligible to receive any form of student assistance from the State unless the school meets a specified graduation rate to be determined by the Secretary of Higher Education.  The bill also included proprietary schools authorized to grant academic degrees within the New Jersey College Student and Parent Consumer Information Act." Specifically, the bill provides that each such proprietary school will have to annually disclose on its website various measures of student graduation rates, school costs, and student loan indebtedness, among other indicators of school quality.  The bill also directs the Secretary of Higher Education to include the student consumer information reports submitted by proprietary schools within a comparative profile that it already prepares of four-year public institutions of higher education.
