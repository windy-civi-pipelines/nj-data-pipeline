<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     <span style='color:
black;background:white'>Preeclampsia is a rapidly progressive increase in blood
pressure that occurs after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Although this high blood
pressure usually goes away after birth, it is dangerous for both the mother and
baby and can lead to life-threatening complications. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
background:white'>     b.    The condition can keep the baby from getting
proper amounts of blood and oxygen from the mother. Preeclampsia can also cause
the mother to have serious problems with her brain, liver, and kidneys. The
most severe cases of preeclampsia can lead to seizures. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
background:white'>     c.     The rate of preeclampsia in the United States has
increased in the last two decades and is a leading cause of maternal and infant
illness and death.  Currently, </span><span style='color:#2B2B2B;background:
white'>preeclampsia affects 5 to 8 percent of pregnant women, or approximately
5,000 to 8,000 individuals in New Jersey annually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:#2B2B2B;
background:white'>     d.    </span><span style='color:black'>Monitoring blood
pressure is therefore an essential part of prenatal and postpartum care.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     e.     Self-measured
blood pressure monitoring in a patients home can be particularly critical in
the case of masked hypertension, where blood pressure levels are elevated at
home despite normal blood pressure in a clinical setting.  In addition, sudden
rises in blood pressure can threaten pregnant women between prenatal appointments
or if they have limited access to healthcare; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     f.     Access
to blood pressure measurement devices or limited knowledge on how to utilize a
device should not be barriers to home-based monitoring. Early detection of high
blood pressure in pregnancy may improve outcomes and<strong> </strong><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>prevent t</span></strong></span><span

preeclampsia; and </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:#333333'>     g.    Providing
pregnant patients in New Jersey with home blood pressure measurement monitors
and the training to use such a monitor is a simple, low cost tool to
significantly improve maternal outcomes in the State. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The sponsors goal is to
provide pregnant patients in New Jersey, particularly those diagnosed with
preeclampsia, with home blood pressure monitors and the training to use such a
monitor to improve maternal outcomes in the State.  Preeclampsia is a high
blood pressure disorder that can occur during or after pregnancy.  The
condition <span style='background:white'>can keep the baby from getting proper
amounts of blood and oxygen from the mother.  Preeclampsia can also cause the
mother to have serious problems with her brain, liver, and kidneys.</span> 
Monitoring blood pressure is therefore an essential part of prenatal and
postpartum care.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Self-measured blood pressure
monitoring in a patients home can be particularly critical in the case of
masked <span style='color:black'>hypertension, where blood pressure levels are
elevated at home despite normal blood pressure in a clinical setting.  In
addition, sudden rises in blood pressure can threaten pregnant women between
prenatal appointments or if they have limited access to healthcare.  This bill
seeks to eliminate barriers to home-based monitoring, such as access to </span>blood
pressure measurement devices or limited knowledge on how to utilize a device. 
In doing so, this bill provides for the early detection of life-threatening high
blood pressure in pregnancy, thereby <strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>preventing
t</span></strong>he maternal and neonatal morbidities associated with
preeclampsia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill directs
that a hospital, a birthing center, a federally qualified health center, or a physician

the reimbursement of the cost of the validated home blood pressure monitor and
any provider time used to educate and train the patient on the proper use of
the blood pressure monitor, to transmit blood pressure data from the patients
blood pressure monitor, and to interpret blood pressure data from the patients
blood pressure monitor, provided that the patient does not have coverage of
such benefits from a third party, such as an insurance carrier or medical
