(cf: P.L.2021, c.342, s.3) 4.    Section 4 of P.L.1982, c.81 (C.2A:4A-73) is amended to read as follows: 2A:4A-73.  Diverting complaints a.  The court may divert a complaint filed pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-30) to intake conferences or juvenile conference committees.  Where the complaint alleges a disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offense the court may dispose of the case as a juvenile-family crisis pursuant to P.L.1982, c.80 (C.2A:4A-76 et seq.).  There shall be a presumption that a complaint alleging a petty disorderly persons offense pursuant to subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be diverted in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-71). The county prosecutor shall be promptly notified of the diversion of a complaint. b.  The complainant or victim of any offense committed by a juvenile diverted by the court, which offense would be a crime if committed by an adult,  shall receive a statement as to the reasons for the proposed diversion. (cf: P.L.1982, c.81, s.4) 5.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill establishes the offense of harassing, intimidating, or bullying a minor and establishes a diversionary program for juveniles who are charged with this offense. The provisions of the bill provide that a person commits the offense of harassment, intimidation, or bullying a minor if the person, through any gesture, written, verbal, or physical act, or any electronic communication, whether it be a single incident or a series of incidents, communicates with a minor: · with the purpose to physically or emotionally harm the minor, damage the minors property, or place a minor in fear of physical or emotional harm to the minors person or damage to the minors property because of the minors race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity; or · knowing that the communication would physically or emotionally harm the minor, damage the minors property, or place the minor in fear of physical or emotional harm to the minors person or damage to the minors property because of the minors race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity. Under the bill, harassing, intimidating, or bullying a minor is a disorderly persons offense, unless a minor is adjudicated for an act that, if committed by an adult would constitute the offense, in which case the minor is guilty of a petty disorderly offense.  In addition, any adult or juvenile who commits an offense is subject to a fine of up to $100 for a first offense and a fine of up to $250 for each subsequent offense.  The bill establishes a presumption that a complaint against a minor who commits an offense of harassing, intimidating, or bullying a minor is to be diverted.  If the offense was committed in a jurisdiction in which there is an existing applicable restorative and transformative justice program, the matter is to be diverted to the restorative justice hub. The bill provides that where a complaint against a juvenile alleges that the juvenile has committed an offense that, if committed by an adult, constitutes an eligible offense involving harassment, intimidation, or bullying as defined in the bill and the court approves diversion of the complaint, the resolution of the complaint would include participation in a remedial education or counseling program if the juvenile is amenable to participation in such a program, and a program is available in the area where the juvenile resides. Also, if appropriate, the court may permit the juvenile to participate in a self-guided awareness program in lieu of a remedial education or counseling program provided that it satisfies the bills requirements. A remedial education or counseling program satisfies the bills requirements if the program is designed to increase the juveniles awareness of: · the legal consequences and penalties for harassing, intimidating, or bullying a minor, including applicable federal and State statutes; · the non-legal consequences of harassing, intimidating, or bullying a minor including, but not limited to, the effect on relationships, loss of educational and employment opportunities, and being barred or removed from school programs and extracurricular activities; · the potential of long-term and unforeseen consequences for harassing, intimidating, or bullying a minor; and · the possible connection between cyber-bullying and harassing, intimidating, or bullying a minor.
