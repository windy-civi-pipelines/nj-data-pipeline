(2)   No pinelands development credit allocated to a parcel of land pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto that is acquired or obtained in connection with the acquisition of the parcel for recreation and conservation purposes by the State, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization using constitutionally dedicated moneys in whole or in part may be conveyed in any manner.  All such pinelands development credits shall be retired permanently. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.70) e.     Moneys appropriated from the fund may be used to match grants, contributions, donations, or reimbursements from federal aid programs or from other public or private sources established for the same or similar purposes as the fund. f.     Moneys appropriated from the fund shall not be used by local government units or qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organizations to acquire lands that are already permanently preserved for recreation and conservation purposes, as determined by the department. g.    Whenever lands are donated to the State by a public utility, as defined pursuant to Title 48 of the Revised Statutes, for recreation and conservation purposes, the commissioner may make and keep the lands accessible to the public, unless the commissioner determines that public accessibility would be detrimental to the lands or any natural resources associated therewith. h.    Whenever the State acquires land for recreation and conservation purposes, the agency in the Department of Environmental Protection responsible for administering the land shall, within six months after the date of acquisition, inspect the land for the presence of any buildings or structures thereon which are or may be historic properties and, within 60 days after completion of the inspection, provide to the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office in the department (1) a written notice of its findings, and (2) for any buildings or structures which are or may be historic properties discovered on the land, a request for determination of potential eligibility for inclusion of the historic building or structure in the New Jersey Register of Historic Places.  Whenever such a building or structure is discovered, a copy of the written notice provided to the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office shall also be sent to the New Jersey Historic Trust and to the county historical commission or advisory committee, the county historical society, the local historic preservation commission or advisory committee, and the local historical society if any of those entities exist in the county or municipality wherein the land is located. i.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.70) j.  (1)  Commencing on the date of enactment of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.) and through June 30, [2024] 2029 for lands located in the Highlands Region as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), when the department, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization seeks to acquire lands for recreation and conservation purposes using constitutionally dedicated moneys in whole or in part, Green Acres bond act moneys in whole or in part, or constitutionally dedicated CBT moneys pursuant to P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) in whole or in part, it shall conduct or cause to be conducted an appraisal or appraisals of the value of the lands that shall be made using (a) the land use zoning of the lands, and any State environmental laws or Department of Environmental Protection rules and regulations that may affect the value of the lands, subject to the appraisal and in effect at the time of proposed acquisition, and (b) the land use zoning of the lands, and any State environmental laws or Department of Environmental Protection rules and regulations that may affect the value of the lands, subject to the appraisal and in effect on January 1, 2004.  The higher of those two values shall be utilized by the department, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization as the basis for negotiation with the landowner with respect to the acquisition price for the lands.  The landowner shall be provided with both values determined pursuant to this paragraph. A landowner may waive any of the requirements of this paragraph and may agree to sell the lands for less than the values determined pursuant to this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable only to lands the owner of which at the time of proposed acquisition is the same person who owned the lands on the date of enactment of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.) and who has owned the lands continuously since that enactment date, or is an immediate family member of that person.

(cf:  P.L.2004, c.120, s.21) 7.  (New section)  a.  Funds shall be distributed each State fiscal year from the "Highlands Protection Fund" created pursuant to section 21 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-19) to each municipality within the Highlands Region that that does not receive watershed moratorium offset aid pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999, c.225 (C.58:29-8) but hosts watershed lands, for those watershed lands, as determined by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, in amounts equal to the per acre rate provided for watershed moratorium offset aid. b.   The State Treasurer shall include in its annual budget request to the Governor the moneys necessary to distribute funds to those municipalities eligible for watershed property municipal aid pursuant to subsection a. of this section.  The Legislature shall appropriate the necessary funds to the department for this purpose. 8.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend and supplement the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), to allocate $7.5 million annually of constitutionally dedicated Corporation Business Tax (CBT) revenue to the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council (council) for the preservation of land in the Highlands Region. The funding in this bill is provided from constitutionally dedicated CBT revenues pursuant to Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution, which dedicates six percent of the CBT for certain environmental purposes.  Under the Preserve New Jersey Act (act), P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), of the dedicated CBT revenues allocated for open space, farmland, and historic preservation, each year:  62 percent is allocated to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for recreation and conservation purposes; 31 percent is allocated to the State Agriculture Development Committee (SADC) for farmland preservation; and the remaining seven percent is allocated to the New Jersey Historic Trust for historic preservation. Under this bill, $5 million of the amount allocated each year to the DEP and $2.5 million of the amount allocated to the SADC would be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Highlands Preservation Fund, a new fund created by the bill.  These moneys, totaling $7.5 million each year would be used by the council to preserve lands located in the Highlands Region. In addition, this bill extends the expiration date of the special appraisal process provided by law for State-funded land acquisitions under the Green Acres program and the farmland preservation program from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2029 for lands located in the Highlands Region.  The term special appraisal process refers to the process in which the State or other eligible participants are currently required by law to conduct two appraisals of lands that are proposed for acquisition, one of which is based on the property value on the proposed acquisition date, the other based on the value of the property as of January 1, 2004.  The higher of the two values is used as the basis of negotiation with the landowner when determining the propertys final acquisition price. In 2004, Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.), was enacted to protect and preserve the drinking water and natural resources of the New Jersey Highlands Region, which is the source of the drinking water of more than half of the residents of New Jersey and offers unique hiking, bird watching, fishing, and other naturalist and recreational activities. Approximately 230 square miles, or approximately 17 percent of land, in the Highlands Region, approximately is considered undeveloped, but developable land.  The council administers, pursuant to rules and regulations found at N.J.A.C.7:70-1.1 et seq., two programs to preserve land in the region in order to protecting the regions vital resources:  the Highlands Open Space Partnership Funding Program and the Highlands Development Credit Purchase Program.  This bill would provide a portion of constitutionally dedicated CBT moneys for open space and farmland preservation to the council to be used for these two programs, in accordance with the requirements of section 5 of this bill and rules and regulations adopted by the council. The council would also be able to use the funding to be provided by the bill as the State match to apply for funding from the federal government pursuant to the Highlands Conservation Act, Pub.L. 108-421, or other similar federal funding.  This federal funding is awarded by the United State Fish and Wildlife Service through the Highland Conservation Act Grant Program, which is designed to assist Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania in conserving land and natural resources in the Highlands Region through federal assistance for land conservation projects in which a State entity acquires land, or an interest in land, from a willing seller to permanently protect resources of high conservation value. Finally, this bill would require that State aid be distributed each State fiscal year from the "Highlands Protection Fund" to each municipality within the Highlands Region that that does not receive watershed moratorium offset aid pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999, c.225 (C.58:29-8) but hosts watershed lands, for those watershed lands, as determined by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, in amounts equal to the per acre rate provided for watershed moratorium offset aid.  The State Treasurer would be required to include in its annual budget request to the Governor the moneys necessary to distribute funds to those municipalities eligible for watershed property municipal aid.

(2)   No pinelands development credit allocated to a parcel of land pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto that is acquired or obtained in connection with the acquisition of the parcel for recreation and conservation purposes by the State, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization using constitutionally dedicated moneys in whole or in part may be conveyed in any manner.  All such pinelands development credits shall be retired permanently. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.70) e.     Moneys appropriated from the fund may be used to match grants, contributions, donations, or reimbursements from federal aid programs or from other public or private sources established for the same or similar purposes as the fund. f.     Moneys appropriated from the fund shall not be used by local government units or qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organizations to acquire lands that are already permanently preserved for recreation and conservation purposes, as determined by the department. g.    Whenever lands are donated to the State by a public utility, as defined pursuant to Title 48 of the Revised Statutes, for recreation and conservation purposes, the commissioner may make and keep the lands accessible to the public, unless the commissioner determines that public accessibility would be detrimental to the lands or any natural resources associated therewith. h.    Whenever the State acquires land for recreation and conservation purposes, the agency in the Department of Environmental Protection responsible for administering the land shall, within six months after the date of acquisition, inspect the land for the presence of any buildings or structures thereon which are or may be historic properties and, within 60 days after completion of the inspection, provide to the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office in the department (1) a written notice of its findings, and (2) for any buildings or structures which are or may be historic properties discovered on the land, a request for determination of potential eligibility for inclusion of the historic building or structure in the New Jersey Register of Historic Places.  Whenever such a building or structure is discovered, a copy of the written notice provided to the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office shall also be sent to the New Jersey Historic Trust and to the county historical commission or advisory committee, the county historical society, the local historic preservation commission or advisory committee, and the local historical society if any of those entities exist in the county or municipality wherein the land is located. i.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.70) j.  (1)  Commencing on the date of enactment of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.) and through June 30, [2024] 2029 for lands located in the Highlands Region as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), when the department, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization seeks to acquire lands for recreation and conservation purposes using constitutionally dedicated moneys in whole or in part, Green Acres bond act moneys in whole or in part, or constitutionally dedicated CBT moneys pursuant to P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) in whole or in part, it shall conduct or cause to be conducted an appraisal or appraisals of the value of the lands that shall be made using (a) the land use zoning of the lands, and any State environmental laws or Department of Environmental Protection rules and regulations that may affect the value of the lands, subject to the appraisal and in effect at the time of proposed acquisition, and (b) the land use zoning of the lands, and any State environmental laws or Department of Environmental Protection rules and regulations that may affect the value of the lands, subject to the appraisal and in effect on January 1, 2004.  The higher of those two values shall be utilized by the department, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization as the basis for negotiation with the landowner with respect to the acquisition price for the lands.  The landowner shall be provided with both values determined pursuant to this paragraph. A landowner may waive any of the requirements of this paragraph and may agree to sell the lands for less than the values determined pursuant to this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable only to lands the owner of which at the time of proposed acquisition is the same person who owned the lands on the date of enactment of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.) and who has owned the lands continuously since that enactment date, or is an immediate family member of that person. (2)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.70) (3)   The requirements of this subsection shall be in addition to any other requirements of law, rule, or regulation not inconsistent therewith.

Any rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall not apply to activities on lands acquired prior to the adoption of the rules and regulations. n. (1) The department, within three months after the date of the first meeting of the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council established pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-4), shall consult with and solicit recommendations from the council concerning land preservation strategies and acquisition plans in the Highlands Region as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3).

STATEMENT This bill would amend and supplement the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), to allocate $7.5 million annually of constitutionally dedicated Corporation Business Tax (CBT) revenue to the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council (council) for the preservation of land in the Highlands Region. The funding in this bill is provided from constitutionally dedicated CBT revenues pursuant to Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution, which dedicates six percent of the CBT for certain environmental purposes.  Under the Preserve New Jersey Act (act), P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), of the dedicated CBT revenues allocated for open space, farmland, and historic preservation, each year:  62 percent is allocated to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for recreation and conservation purposes; 31 percent is allocated to the State Agriculture Development Committee (SADC) for farmland preservation; and the remaining seven percent is allocated to the New Jersey Historic Trust for historic preservation. Under this bill, $5 million of the amount allocated each year to the DEP and $2.5 million of the amount allocated to the SADC would be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Highlands Preservation Fund, a new fund created by the bill.  These moneys, totaling $7.5 million each year would be used by the council to preserve lands located in the Highlands Region. In addition, this bill extends the expiration date of the special appraisal process provided by law for State-funded land acquisitions under the Green Acres program and the farmland preservation program from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2029 for lands located in the Highlands Region.  The term special appraisal process refers to the process in which the State or other eligible participants are currently required by law to conduct two appraisals of lands that are proposed for acquisition, one of which is based on the property value on the proposed acquisition date, the other based on the value of the property as of January 1, 2004.  The higher of the two values is used as the basis of negotiation with the landowner when determining the propertys final acquisition price. In 2004, Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.), was enacted to protect and preserve the drinking water and natural resources of the New Jersey Highlands Region, which is the source of the drinking water of more than half of the residents of New Jersey and offers unique hiking, bird watching, fishing, and other naturalist and recreational activities. Approximately 230 square miles, or approximately 17 percent of land, in the Highlands Region, approximately is considered undeveloped, but developable land.  The council administers, pursuant to rules and regulations found at N.J.A.C.7:70-1.1 et seq., two programs to preserve land in the region in order to protecting the regions vital resources:  the Highlands Open Space Partnership Funding Program and the Highlands Development Credit Purchase Program.  This bill would provide a portion of constitutionally dedicated CBT moneys for open space and farmland preservation to the council to be used for these two programs, in accordance with the requirements of section 5 of this bill and rules and regulations adopted by the council. The council would also be able to use the funding to be provided by the bill as the State match to apply for funding from the federal government pursuant to the Highlands Conservation Act, Pub.L. 108-421, or other similar federal funding.  This federal funding is awarded by the United State Fish and Wildlife Service through the Highland Conservation Act Grant Program, which is designed to assist Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania in conserving land and natural resources in the Highlands Region through federal assistance for land conservation projects in which a State entity acquires land, or an interest in land, from a willing seller to permanently protect resources of high conservation value. Finally, this bill would require that State aid be distributed each State fiscal year from the "Highlands Protection Fund" to each municipality within the Highlands Region that that does not receive watershed moratorium offset aid pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999, c.225 (C.58:29-8) but hosts watershed lands, for those watershed lands, as determined by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, in amounts equal to the per acre rate provided for watershed moratorium offset aid.  The State Treasurer would be required to include in its annual budget request to the Governor the moneys necessary to distribute funds to those municipalities eligible for watershed property municipal aid.
