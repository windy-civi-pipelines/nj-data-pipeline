This bill establishes that the limitation against recovery also does not apply to an action at law for an injury resulting from the commission of sexual assault, a prohibited sexual act as defined in N.J.S.A.2A:30B-2, sexual abuse as defined in N.J.S.A.2A:61B-1, or any other crime of sexual nature.
