The application shall be addressed and submitted to the mayor or other chief executive officer of the municipality.  The mayor or other chief executive officer shall, within 60 days of his receipt of the application thereafter, submit the application with his recommendations, and an independent cost-benefit analysis of the projects impact on the finances of the municipality, county, and other taxing districts, within which the project is located, conducted by the office, or other designee, of the mayor or other chief executive officer, to the municipal governing body.  The independent cost-benefit analysis shall include, at a minimum, the information required in subsection g. of this section.  Within 30 days of submission to the municipal governing body, the municipality shall post the independent cost-benefit analysis on its Internet website, or, if one does not exist, the independent cost-benefit analysis shall be provided for public inspection on the Internet website of the Department of Community Affairs. The governing body shall by resolution approve or disapprove the application, but in the event of disapproval, changes may be suggested to secure approval.  The resolution shall include specific findings about the projects estimated net impact on the finances of the municipality, county, and other taxing districts, within which the project is located.  Within 30 days of adoption of the resolution, the municipality shall post the resolution on its Internet website, or, if one does not exist, the resolution shall be provided for public inspection on the Internet website of the Department of Community Affairs.  An application may be revised and resubmitted. (cf: P.L.1991, c.431, s.8) 2.    (New section)  a.  A municipality shall notify the Department of Community Affairs within 30 days after approving a financial agreement pursuant to section 9 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-9).  The notice shall include the same information required to be included in a plain language budget summary for long term tax exemptions pursuant to subsection b. of section 39 of P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A:5-48). b.    The Department of Community Affairs, in consultation with the Office of Information Technology, shall design, develop, and maintain a database on its Internet website that contains and displays: (1) the information provided to the department pursuant to subsection a. of this section, and (2) the information included in plain language budget summaries for long term tax exemptions pursuant to subsection b. of section 39 of P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A:5-48), which were approved prior to the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), sorted by municipality. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require an application for a long term property tax exemption to include a cost-benefit analysis and for the mayor or other chief executive officer of the municipality to produce an independent cost-benefit analysis to be submitted along with the application to the municipal governing body before it can decide on the exemption.  The bill would also require a municipal governing body to include in its resolution approving or disapproving of a project for which a long term tax exemption is sought specific findings about the net impact of the project on the finances of the directly affected local governments, namely the municipality, county, school district, and other taxing districts within which the project is located. The cost-benefit analyses and financial impact findings required for grants of long term property tax exemptions would have to be posted on the Internet website of the granting municipality.  If the municipality does not have a website, this information would have to be provided for public inspection on the Internet website of the Department of Community Affairs (DCA).  Municipalities that grant new long term property tax exemptions would have to provide pertinent information about each approved project to DCA, which would post that information, along with existing long term property tax exemption information retrieved from plain language budget summaries submitted to DCA, in a database, sorted by municipality, on its Internet website. This bill would ensure that municipalities consider and evaluate whether an investment in a redevelopment project through the grant of a long term property tax exemption will generate satisfactory revenue returns to the municipality, as well as the financial impacts on counties, school districts, and other local governments.  The bill would also allow the public to do the same by making the required cost-benefit analyses and financial impact findings, as well as complete long term property tax exemption information for each municipality, easily accessible on the Internet.
