P.L.2009, c.79 and P.L.2020, c.70.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known and
may be cited as the Protecting Mail-in Voters Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 3 of P.L.2009,
c.79 (C.19:63-3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3. a. A qualified voter shall
be entitled to vote using a mail-in ballot:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) in all future elections,
including general elections, held in this State, in which the voter is eligible
to vote; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) in any single election
held in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The qualified voter who
chooses the option to vote using a mail-in ballot in all future elections shall
be furnished with such a ballot by the county clerk without further request on
the part of the voter and until the voter requests in writing that the voter no
longer be sent a mail-in ballot, or beginning with the 2020 general election
cycle, if the voter does not vote by mail in four consecutive years, then the
voter shall no longer be furnished with a mail-in ballot for future elections
and the voter shall be notified in writing of the change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The mail-in ballot application
form prepared by the Secretary of State shall present the two options in the
order provided above.  The mail-in ballot application shall also provide <u>information
and instructions regarding the need for voters intending to vote by mail to enclose
a copy of a current and valid form of State-accepted photo identification matching
that individuals name and current address within the mail-in ballot envelope,</u>
spaces for the voter's telephone number and email address, including language
informing the voter that this contact information will be used to contact the
voter concerning the acceptance or rejection of the ballot, and how the voter
may cure a defect.  A voter's <u>personal identifying information contained in
their photo identification,</u> telephone number<u>,</u> and email address
shall not be subject to public disclosure and shall not be considered a
government record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The additional direct
expenditures required for the implementation of the provisions of this
subsection as amended by section 1 of P.L.2018, c.72 shall be offset pursuant
to section 1 of P.L.2019, c.459 (C.19:63-29).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) Not less than seven
days before an election in which a voter wants to vote by mail, the voter may
apply to the person designated in section 5 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-5), for
a mail-in ballot.  The application shall be in writing, shall be signed by the
applicant and shall state the applicant's place of voting residence and the
address to which the ballot shall be sent.  In the case of a voter choosing to
have their mail-in ballot sent to a secondary address, if the ballot is
returned or marked undeliverable for two consecutive general elections, then
future mail-in ballots shall be mailed to the voter's address where they are
registered to vote and the voter shall be notified in writing of the change. 
The Secretary of State shall prepare a mail-in application form and shall have
the authority to promulgate any rules and regulations the secretary deems
necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Beginning on January 1,
2026 and thereafter, not less than seven days before an election in which a
voter wants to vote by mail, instead of submitting an application under
paragraph (1) of this subsection, the voter may apply for a mail-in ballot
electronically through the voter registration website established by the
Secretary of State pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2019, c.382 (C.19:31-6.4c),
which application shall be electronically submitted to the person designated by
the Secretary of State.  The application shall be in electronic form, shall be
signed by the applicant using the applicant's electronic signature in the
Statewide Voter Registration System, and shall state the applicant's place of
voting residence and the address to which the ballot shall be sent.  The Secretary
of State shall prepare a mail-in ballot electronic application form and shall
have the authority to promulgate any guidance, guidelines, rules and
regulations the secretary deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this
subsection.  The rules and regulations shall ensure the security of the online
mail-in ballot application form and the use of verifiable signatures, including
a process for the resolution of signature discrepancies and the validation of
the information provided by the applicant.</p>

not match.</p>

c.79 (C.19:63-17) that all county boards of elections persons handling ballots
shall be required to read or view prior to the election. The materials shall
provide clear information regarding the standards for acceptance and rejection
of mail-in ballots and the safe holding of all materials in the case of
rejection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Prior to each election,
the Secretary of State shall direct all county boards of elections and their
members, agents, employees, and representatives, who shall be collectively known
as the &quot;evaluators,&quot; and who are responsible for authenticating or
verifying mail-in ballots pursuant to section 17 of P.L.2009, c.79
(C.19:63-17), or authenticating or verifying provisional ballots pursuant to
section 19 of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-13), to comply with the provisions of
subsection c. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Secretary of State
and each county board of elections shall ensure that all evaluators receive,
and are directed to comply with, written guidance stating as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   when verifying
signatures, evaluators shall keep in mind that everyone writes differently, and
no one signs their name exactly the same way twice;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   some variation in
signatures is to be expected;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   many factors can lead to
signature variance, including, but not limited to, age, disability, underlying
health conditions, writing implement or surface, level of concentration, and
educational background;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   according to studies,
evaluators are more likely to declare genuine signatures to be non-genuine than
they are to accept a non-genuine signature as genuine, and the goal is to
prevent these errors in signature verification; <b><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   evaluators shall presume
that the documents were signed by the same person and shall accept a signature
as valid unless there is a clear discrepancy that cannot be reasonably
explained<u>; and</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(6)   when verifying the
validity of the provided photo identification, evaluators shall consider the
name and address contained on the photo identification and the name and address
provided on the returned mail-in ballot</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Secretary of State
shall, not later than 14 days prior to the election, publish the signature
matching guidelines required under subsection c. of this section which each
evaluator shall be required to follow in determining if mail-in voter
signatures match.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e. The Secretary of State
shall, at least 30 days prior to the election, conduct a voter education
campaign to inform voters about the signature matching<u>, photo identification

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
Protecting Mail-in Voters Act, which modifies The Vote By Mail Law to
require all voters who use a mail-in ballot to vote to enclose a copy of a
valid form of State-accepted photo identification matching the voters name and
current address within the mail-in ballots outer envelope.  The bill requires
the county board of elections to compare the signature and the information
contained on the copy of the voters photo identification with the signature
and information contained in the requests for mail-in ballots and the signature
and information contained in the Statewide voter registration system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
Secretary of State to conduct an education campaign to inform voters of these
new requirements and to provide voters with instructions for how to properly
submit a mail-in ballot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that any voter
who votes using a mail-in ballot which is rejected for failure to include a
copy of the voters photo identification be given the opportunity to cure the
deficiency to allow their vote to be counted by completing the cure form sent
to the voter by the county board of elections and by including the documents
that were not present in the voters mail-in ballot.</p>
