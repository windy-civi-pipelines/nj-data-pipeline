(cf: P.L.2003, c.30, s.2) 5.    Section 5 of P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.72) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a.  When title to a homestead as to which a homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit is claimed is held by an eligible claimant and another or others, either as tenants in common or as joint tenants, the eligible claimant shall not be allowed a homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit in an amount in excess of his or her proportionate share of the taxes assessed against the homestead, which proportionate share, for the purposes of [this act] P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.67 et al.), shall be deemed to be equal to that of each of the other tenants, unless it is shown that the interests in question are not equal, in which event the eligible claimant's proportionate share shall be as shown.  Nothing herein shall preclude more than one tenant, whether title be held in common or joint tenancy, from claiming a homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit from the taxes assessed against the property so held, but no more than the equivalent of one full homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit in regard to such homestead shall be allowed in any year.  In any case in which the eligible claimants cannot agree as to the apportionment thereof, such homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit shall be apportioned between or among them in proportion to their interest.  Property held by husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety, shall be deemed wholly owned by each tenant, but no more than one full homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit in regard to such homestead shall be allowed in any year.  Right to claim a homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit hereunder shall extend to a homestead the title to which is held by a partnership, to the extent of the eligible claimant's interest as a partner therein, and by a guardian, trustee, committee, conservator or other fiduciary for any person who would otherwise be entitled to claim such homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit hereunder, but not to a homestead the title to which is held by a corporation; except that a residential shareholder in a cooperative or mutual housing corporation shall be entitled to claim a homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit if he or she is otherwise eligible to receive it, to the extent of the proportionate share of the taxes assessed against the homestead of the corporation, or any other entity holding title, attributable to his or her unit therein.  [No] An eligible claimant shall not be entitled to [payment under this act for] a homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit on more than one homestead within the State in the same tax year. b.    When title to a homestead with respect to which a homestead property tax freeze benefit is claimed for a year is transferred to another owner during that year, the amount of the benefit shall be prorated proportionally to the number of days the eligible claimant occupied the homestead during the year. (cf: P.L.1997, c.348, s.5) 6.    Section 6 of P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.73) is amended to read as follows: 6.    Pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the director shall promulgate such rules and regulations and prescribe such forms as the director shall deem necessary to implement [this act] P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.67 et al.).  The director shall also promulgate rules and regulations to implement an appeals process for aggrieved persons to use if eligibility for a homestead property tax [reimbursement rebate or credit] freeze benefit is denied. (cf: P.L.2007, c.62, s.32) 7.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the tax year next following enactment, except the director may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill would transform the homestead property tax reimbursement program, commonly known as the senior freeze program, from a reimbursement program into a credit program for most eligible homeowners.  Currently, eligible seniors and disabled persons may apply for a senior freeze benefit that reimburses them for any property tax increases paid in the prior tax year over and above the amount of property taxes paid in the applicable base year.  This bill would allow most of these eligible homeowners to realize these savings in the form of a credit directly applied to reduce the payable amount for their third and fourth quarter property tax bills for the current tax year.  Currently, eligible seniors and disabled persons are provided their senior freeze benefits as a reimbursement in the following tax year. Eligible homeowners who reside in a unit in a cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community, and who do not pay property taxes directly to the municipality, would receive a rebate payment instead of a credit directly applied to the applicable property tax bill.  These rebates would be paid during the current tax year for which the senior freeze benefit is sought so that these homeowners also do not have to wait until the next year to receive their senior freeze benefit. It is the intention of the sponsor that this bill would be administered in the same manner as the homestead property tax credit benefit, resulting in administrative savings to the State, as well as provide current tax year savings to eligible senior and disabled residents.

(cf: P.L.1997, c.348, s.5) 6.    Section 6 of P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.73) is amended to read as follows: 6.    Pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the director shall promulgate such rules and regulations and prescribe such forms as the director shall deem necessary to implement [this act] P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.67 et al.).  The director shall also promulgate rules and regulations to implement an appeals process for aggrieved persons to use if eligibility for a homestead property tax [reimbursement rebate or credit] freeze benefit is denied. (cf: P.L.2007, c.62, s.32) 7.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the tax year next following enactment, except the director may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill would transform the homestead property tax reimbursement program, commonly known as the senior freeze program, from a reimbursement program into a credit program for most eligible homeowners.  Currently, eligible seniors and disabled persons may apply for a senior freeze benefit that reimburses them for any property tax increases paid in the prior tax year over and above the amount of property taxes paid in the applicable base year.  This bill would allow most of these eligible homeowners to realize these savings in the form of a credit directly applied to reduce the payable amount for their third and fourth quarter property tax bills for the current tax year.  Currently, eligible seniors and disabled persons are provided their senior freeze benefits as a reimbursement in the following tax year. Eligible homeowners who reside in a unit in a cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community, and who do not pay property taxes directly to the municipality, would receive a rebate payment instead of a credit directly applied to the applicable property tax bill.  These rebates would be paid during the current tax year for which the senior freeze benefit is sought so that these homeowners also do not have to wait until the next year to receive their senior freeze benefit. It is the intention of the sponsor that this bill would be administered in the same manner as the homestead property tax credit benefit, resulting in administrative savings to the State, as well as provide current tax year savings to eligible senior and disabled residents.
