SCR116 SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION No. 116 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED OCTOBER 28, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  JON M. BRAMNICK District 21 (Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union) Senator  PATRICK J. DIEGNAN, JR. District 18 (Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Establishes Joint Legislative Statesmanship Task Force to promote importance of civility to students in grades kindergarten through 12. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Concurrent Resolution establishing the Joint Legislative Statesmanship Task Force. Whereas, Civility is one of the most basic yet important virtues to be integrated into the education of young people; and Whereas, While civility is often associated only with being polite or courteous, the concept of civility extends even further and, when integrated properly into civic life, allows individuals to disagree without disrespect and to seek common ground as a starting point for dialogue about differences; and Whereas, The concept of civility allows for more vigorous public debate as it emphasizes a deeper understanding of others biases and preconceptions and promotes exploration of that understanding through respect, kindness, compassion, and open dialogue; and Whereas, Schools are the ideal settings to begin teaching civic virtues, since young people spend most of their waking hours learning in classrooms and interacting with their classmates and peers; and Whereas, Although civility should be underscored in the school curriculum and in the school setting, it is important for students to understand that civility can be practiced in everyday life outside of the classroom and even in future careers; and Whereas, It can be instructive for students to learn from individuals who practice civility on a daily basis and to be provided examples of times in which civility led to positive outcomes; and Whereas, The spirit of public debate at all levels of government is one that should be centered on respect, compassion, and honesty, and elected officials should be leading examples of bringing civility into these discussions; and Whereas, Too often, however, the political discourse that is on public display is characterized by impoliteness, aggression, and deceit; and Whereas, During an era in which hostile political rhetoric and political violence has increased, it is imperative to emphasize civility to students in the State and to highlight the experiences of decision-makers who have effectively deployed the virtues of civility in order to enact positive change; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey (the General Assembly concurring): 1.  a.  There is established the Joint Legislative Statesmanship Task Force.  The purpose of the task force shall be to promote the importance of civility to students in grades kindergarten through 12 across the State and to emphasize the importance of treating each other with respect and dignity in daily interactions and discourse, even during times in which students may differ in opinions or beliefs. b.  The task force shall be comprised of 12 members of the Legislature, to be appointed as follows: (1)  six members of the Senate, three of whom shall be members of the majority party appointed by the Senate President and three of whom shall be members of the minority party appointed by the Minority Leader of the Senate; and (2)  six members of the General Assembly, three of whom shall be members of the majority party appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly and three of whom shall be members of the minority party appointed by the Minority Leader of the General Assembly. c.  In appointing members to the task force, the presiding officers and minority leaders shall each consider factors relevant to the work of the task force, which factors shall include, but not be limited to, the members records of working in a bipartisan manner. d.  The task force shall be entitled to call to its assistance and avail itself of the services of the employees of any State, county, or municipal department, board, bureau, commission, or agency, or any public institution of higher education in the State, as it may require and as may be available to it for its purposes, and to employ stenographic and clerical assistance and incur traveling and other miscellaneous expenses necessary to perform its duties, within the limits of funds appropriated or otherwise made available to it for its purposes. 2.  a.  In conducting its business, the task force shall annually travel to schools across the State to, at a minimum, discuss with students: (1)  the core values that underpin the meaning of civility and how it can be practiced in everyday life, even while in school; (2)  the importance of engaging with others in a respectful manner and ways in which students can foster meaningful and productive dialogue with each other even when they disagree on a particular topic; (3)  instances in which the members of the task force worked with others to resolve differences in a civil way; (4)  cases in which the members of the task force worked with other members of the Legislature, especially those who are of different political affiliations, in order facilitate positive change through the legislative process; (5)  examples of times in which the members of the task force did not agree with others and how the members expressed their disagreement, or otherwise resolved the disagreement, in a civil way; and (6)  overall how to demonstrate mutual respect and consideration in language, attitudes, behaviors, and verbal, nonverbal, written, and digital communications. b.  In fulfilling the requirements of subsection a. of this section, the task force shall annually travel to schools it designates and ensure that it visits a cross section of elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools located in urban, suburban, and rural areas of the State, with equal consideration given to schools located in the north, central, and southern geographical regions of the State. 3.  This concurrent resolution shall take effect immediately.
