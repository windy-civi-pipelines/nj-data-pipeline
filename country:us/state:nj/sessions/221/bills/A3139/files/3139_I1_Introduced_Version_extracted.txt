The report shall include, but not be limited to, the following information: the number of registered family day care homes; the number of children served and their ages; the number of requests by parents for copies of the permanent records of registered family day care providers received by the family day care sponsoring organizations; and the number of inquiries by parents or guardians to the family day care sponsoring organizations or to the State-operated child care clearinghouse.  A summary of the report shall be made available on the department's official Internet site or in writing to the public, upon request. (cf: P.L.1987, c.27, s.9) 8.    Section 1 of P.L.1993, c.350 (C.30:5B-25.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The need for a variety of child care options for families with children between birth and 13 years of age has grown significantly in the past 20 years.  As a result, family day care has become one of the most used forms of child care in the State. b.    In 1987, New Jersey implemented a voluntary registration system through the "Family Day Care Provider Registration Act," P.L.1987, c.27 (C.30:5B-16 et seq.). The purpose of the act was to provide Statewide health and safety standards to protect children in family day care homes.  Through this voluntary system, providers [are] were able to qualify for the purchase of insurance, enroll in the Child Care Food Program, list their homes with Statewide child care resource and referral agencies, and provide care for children through State-funded programs.  Parents were assured that minimum safety standards were met and the training of providers and the monitoring of homes was taking place. c.     When the 1987 law was amended in 1991 to require criminal history record background checks for all adults in the home of a family day care provider, both registrations and renewals dropped significantly.  This was due to the cost of criminal history record background checks.  Since the family day care registration system [is] was voluntary, providers chose to continue to operate without State supervision. In 1992, the State established an 18 month moratorium on background checks during which time[,] an alternative procedure for checking the background of prospective family day care providers could be developed. d.    It is therefore in the best interests of the State to find a system of background checks which balances the rights of family day care providers with the State's duty to protect the safety of its youngest citizens. (cf: P.L.1993, c.350, s.1) 9.    This act shall take effect on the 180th day after the date of enactment, but the Commissioner of Children and Families may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill makes various statutory changes to the "Family Day Care Provider Registration Act," P.L.1987, c.27 (C.30:5B-16 et seq.).  Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Children and Families (DCF) to contract with family day care sponsoring organizations for the mandatory registration of family day care providers.  Currently, family day care providers are registered on a voluntary basis. The bill also stipulates that a family day care sponsoring organization shall monitor and evaluate a registered family day care provider once every year, instead of every two years as the law allows. Under the provisions of the bill, a family day care sponsoring organization shall make available to parents copies of the permanent records it maintains for each registered family day care provider, upon request.  The sponsoring organization shall also provide a program of outreach and public relations to inform parents of the provisions of the bill. The bill requires DCF to prepare and submit an annual report to the Governor and the Legislature which includes, but is not limited to: ●       the number of registered family day care homes; ●       the number of children served and their ages; ●       the number of requests by parents for copies of the permanent records of registered family day care providers received by family day care sponsoring organizations; and ●       the number of inquiries by parents or guardians to the family day care sponsoring organizations or to the State-operated child care clearinghouse. Finally, the bill stipulates that a summary of the report be made available on the DCF Internet site or in writing to the public, upon request.
