Health professionals may prescribe anti-obesity medications for use by patients who have obesity-related health problems that have not been mitigated by diet and exercise alone. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), studies show that anti-obesity drugs are most effective when taken as part of a lifestyle program that also includes physical activity and healthy eating habits.  While weight loss among patients taking anti-obesity medications varies by medication and the individual, the average weight loss among patients taking such medications ranges from five to ten percent of the patients starting weight. According to the NIH, ten Food and Drug Administration approved anti-obesity medications are currently available for adult use in the United States. Obesity is a chronic disease that affected 28.6 percent of New Jersey residents in 2022, according to the New Jersey State Health Assessment Data (NJSHAD).  The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines obesity as being a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher.  Individuals with obesity are at increased risk for certain diseases and health conditions, including Type 2 diabetes, asthma, sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and stroke.
