(cf: P.L.1995, c.325, s.4) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would authorize local government units to assess and collect a convenience fee of up to $3 for accepting an electronic payment, and clarifies that local units are also required to provide traditional payment options for those who prefer making payments via non-electronic means.  The Supreme Court of New Jersey recently affirmed an Appellate Division decision ruling that the "Government Electronic Payment Acceptance Act" does not authorize the imposition of a convenience fee for accepting electronic payments, which several counties had been imposing.  This bill would amend that law to authorize such fees in order to offset the administrative expenses borne by local government units in accepting electronic payments.
