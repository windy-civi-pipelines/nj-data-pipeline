<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 11 of P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-311) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11.  a.  In adopting its
housing element, the municipality may provide for its fair share of low- and
moderate-income housing by means of any technique or combination of techniques
which provide a realistic opportunity for the provision of the fair share.  The
housing element shall contain an analysis demonstrating that it will provide
such a realistic opportunity, and the municipality shall establish that its
land use and other relevant ordinances have been revised to incorporate the
provisions for low- and moderate-income housing.  In preparing the housing
element, the municipality shall consider the following techniques for providing
low- and moderate-income housing within the municipality, as well as such other
appropriate techniques as have been established through applicable precedent
and may be employed by the municipality:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Rezoning for densities
necessary to assure the economic viability of any inclusionary developments,
either through mandatory set-asides or density bonuses, as may be necessary to
meet all or part of the municipality's fair share in accordance with <b>t</b>he
provisions of subsection h. of this section;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Determination of the
total residential zoning necessary to assure that the municipality's fair share
is achieved;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Determination of
measures that the municipality will take to assure that low- and
moderate-income units remain affordable to low- and moderate-income households
for an appropriate period of not less than the period required by the
regulations adopted by the Department of Community Affairs pursuant to section
21 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A plan for
infrastructure expansion and rehabilitation and conversion or redevelopment of
unused or underutilized real property, including existing structures, if
necessary to assure the achievement of the municipality's fair share of low-
and moderate-income housing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Donation or use of
municipally owned land or land condemned by the municipality for purposes of
providing low- and moderate-income housing; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Tax abatements for
purposes of providing low- and moderate-income housing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Utilization of funds
obtained from any State or federal subsidy toward the construction of low- and
moderate-income housing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   Utilization of
municipally generated funds toward the construction of low- and moderate-income
housing; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   The purchase of
privately owned real property used for residential purposes at the value of all
liens secured by the property, excluding any tax liens, notwithstanding that
the total amount of debt secured by liens exceeds the appraised value of the
property, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Community
Affairs pursuant to subsection b. of section 41 of P.L.2000, c.126
(C.52:27D-311.2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The municipality may
provide for a phasing schedule for the achievement of its fair share of low-
and moderate-income housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.2008, c.46)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Nothing in P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) shall require a municipality to raise or expend
municipal revenues in order to provide low- and moderate-income housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     When a municipality's
housing element includes the provision of rental housing units in a community
residence for the developmentally disabled, for the mentally ill, or for
persons with head injuries, as those terms are defined in section 2 of
P.L.1977, c.448 (C.30:11B-2), or in transitional housing, which will be
affordable to persons of low- and moderate-income, and for which adequate
measures to retain such affordability pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection
a. of this section are included in the housing element, those housing units
shall be fully credited towards the fulfillment of the municipality's fair
share of low- and moderate-income housing.  A municipality shall not credit
transitional housing units towards more than 10 percent of the municipalitys
fair share obligation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     It having been
determined by the Legislature that the provision of housing under P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) is a public purpose, a municipality or
municipalities may utilize public monies to make donations, grants or loans of
public funds for the rehabilitation of deficient housing units and the
provision of new or substantially rehabilitated housing for low- and
moderate-income persons, providing that any private advantage is incidental.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  A municipality that has
received approval of its housing element and fair share plan for the current
round, and that has actually effected the construction of the affordable
housing units it is obligated to provide, may amend its affordable housing
element or zoning ordinances without losing immunity from exclusionary zoning
litigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Whenever affordable
housing units are proposed to be provided through an inclusionary development,
a municipality shall provide, through its zoning powers, incentives to the
developer, which shall include increased densities and reduced costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     A municipality and a
developer may request a modification of a compliance certification involving
reduced affordable housing set-asides or increased densities to ensure the
economic feasibility of an inclusionary development, if any such application
demonstrates how any shortfall in meeting the municipal fair share obligation
will then be addressed.  Such a request may be granted only if the municipality
and developer have demonstrated that the project has been impacted by market
conditions beyond their reasonable control.</p>

in that particular project.  This preference shall be established in the
applicant selection process for available affordable units so that applicants
who are veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as referenced in
this subsection, and who apply within 90 days of the initial marketing period
shall receive preference for the rental of the agreed-upon percentage of
affordable units.  After the first 90 days of the initial 120-day marketing
period, if any of those units subject to the preference remain available, then
applicants from the general public shall be considered for occupancy. 
Following the initial 120-day marketing period, previously qualified applicants

other emergency, as referenced in this subsection, shall be placed on a special
waiting list as well as the general waiting list.  The veterans on the special

obtain bonus credit is expressly provided pursuant to this section, or other
sections of the &quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et

any unit, and a municipality shall not be permitted to satisfy more than 25
percent of its prospective need obligation in the fourth round or any
subsequent round through the use of bonus credits.  This subsection shall not
be construed to limit the ability of a municipality to receive a unit of credit
for a low- or moderate-income housing unit that is subject to affordability
controls that are scheduled to expire, but are extended pursuant to section 21
of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321), to the extent that this affordability

shall not be required to provide that a specific percentage of the units in any
specific project be reserved as very low-income housing in order to obtain this
