residential rental property and supplementing Title 2A of the New Jersey
Statutes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A warranty of
habitability shall be implied in every written lease, oral lease, or rental
agreement for residential premises, warranting that the premises so leased or
rented, including the areas used in common with other tenants or residents, are
fit for human habitation and for the uses reasonably expected and intended by residential
tenants, and that the occupants of the residential premises shall not be
subjected to any conditions which would be dangerous, hazardous, or detrimental
to their life, health, or safety, or to the livability of the residential
premises.  The procedures and remedies set forth in this section are intended
to facilitate the enforcement of the implied warranty of habitability by the courts,
and shall not be construed to hinder or limit the ongoing judicial construction
and development of the implied warranty of habitability.  Tenants shall be
entitled to assert and receive the maximum protections and remedies
cumulatively available under State and federal statutory, administrative, and
common law, and nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting a
tenants right to seek the maximum protections possible from all sources.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)        A tenant may
assert a breach of the implied warranty of habitability as a defense or set-off
in a landlords eviction action for non-payment of any rent withheld.  The
defense may assert a breach of the implied warranty of habitability with regard
to any condition which commenced during the twelve months immediately preceding
the filing of the eviction action, provided that the landlord had received
prior actual or constructive notice of the condition.  If the breach is proven,
the tenants rental obligation shall be reduced to the reasonable rental value
of the property in its defective condition during the period of occupancy, and the
tenant shall be entitled to an offset in the amount of the cost of all repairs
made by the tenant which the landlord was obligated but failed to make.  Such
reduction in rent:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  shall be retroactive to
the date the landlord had actual or constructive notice of the defective
condition or conditions, but no more than twelve months prior to a landlords
filing of the eviction action, unless the tenant had commenced rent withholding
at any earlier date; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  shall continue
prospectively until the landlord corrects the breach.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Nothing in this section
shall limit a tenants right to file an affirmative action for a retroactive
rent reduction covering any or all months of occupancy during which a defective
condition is alleged to have existed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)  A tenant who
asserts a breach of the implied warranty of habitability as a defense or
set-off shall not be required to deposit outstanding rent with the court,
except as otherwise required under this subsection.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   If a tenant asserts a
breach of the implied warranty of habitability as a defense in an action for
the non-payment of rent, based, in whole or in part, on an alleged code
violation or defective condition of the residential premises, the court shall,
prior to hearing the matter, order an inspection of the premises by the
appropriate code enforcement official or officials having jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the alleged breach.  Within 30 days of the date of the court
order, the code enforcement official shall inspect the premises and prepare and
deliver to the court a written report identifying all code violations and
defective conditions existing at the residential premises, and describing the
extent to which the health or safety of residents are impaired or threatened by
the condition of the premises.  The court, in its discretion, may extend the
time within which a code enforcement official shall deliver a report under this
paragraph.  The court shall provide a copy of a code enforcement officials
report to other tenants of the residential premises, and upon request, to any
member of the general public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   After review of any
report or reports prepared pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, and
after providing the parties notice and an opportunity for a plenary hearing on
the issue of breach of the implied warranty of habitability, the court shall
determine if a breach has occurred.  If the court determines that a breach of

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  The court shall control
disbursement of amounts deposited with the court pursuant to this subsection,

estimates and receipts from contractors, to the court; and allowing tenants to
review and comment on submitted documentation and the progress of work.  If a
matter is transferred to an administrator or receiver, as authorized pursuant
to subsection g. of this section, control over the disbursement of amounts
deposited with the court shall be transferred to the administrator or receiver.</p>

apply additional relevant factors applicable to the facts and circumstances at
issue with the goal of providing the tenant with a habitable dwelling unit.</p>

amount of rent reduction or damages to which a tenant shall be entitled as a
result of a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, the court need not
require any expert testimony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would codify and
expand upon the court-created doctrine of the implied warranty of habitability
in order to enhance the use of the doctrine as a defense to residential
eviction proceedings.  This will help prevent the eviction of residential
tenants and help ensure that rental housing in our State meets reasonable
standards of habitability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Tenants have the right to
safe, sanitary, and decent housing.  New Jersey courts recognize that
residential leases carry an implied warranty of habitability.  This means
that a landlord has a duty to maintain the rental unit and keep it fit for
residential purposes throughout the entire term of the lease and that the
landlord must repair damage to vital facilities.  If the landlord breaches the
landlords obligation of maintaining the property at an adequate standard of
habitability, a tenant may withhold the rent or a portion of the rent to be
used as a set-off, because of the deficient condition.  If the landlord
institutes an eviction proceeding for non-payment of rent, the tenant is
entitled to use the landlords breach of the obligation to provide a habitable
residence as a defense and justification for the set-off (deduction of rental
payment).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An eviction is an actual
expulsion of a tenant out of the premises.  A landlord must have good cause to
evict a tenant.  There are several grounds for a good cause eviction.  If a
tenant fails to pay rent, the landlord may immediately take legal action to
have the tenant evicted.  Although a tenant may assert a breach of the implied
warranty of habitability as a defense in a landlords eviction action for
non-payment of rent, the defense is rarely raised. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a tenant may assert
a breach of the implied warranty of habitability as a defense or set-off in a
landlords eviction action for non-payment of rent withheld.  A tenant may
assert a breach of the implied warranty of habitability with regard to any
condition which commenced during the twelve months immediately preceding the
filing of the eviction action, provided that the landlord had received prior
actual or constructive notice of the condition.  If a tenant proves a breach,
the court would reduce the tenants rental obligation to the reasonable rental
value of the property in its defective condition, and the tenant would be
entitled to an offset in the amount of the cost of all repairs made by the
tenant which the landlord was obligated but failed to make.  The rent reduction
would be retroactive and continue prospectively until the landlord corrects the
breach.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
provides that a tenant who asserts a breach of the implied warranty of
habitability as a defense or set-off would not be required to immediately
deposit outstanding rent with the court.  Instead, the bill sets forth a
process, which would include: a code enforcement officials inspection of the
premises for the existence of code violations and defective conditions, and the
preparation of a report identifying code violations and defective conditions, and
documenting the extent to which the health or safety of residents are impaired
or threatened by the condition of the premises.  After the courts review of
the report, and after providing the parties notice and an opportunity for a
plenary hearing on the issue of breach of the implied warranty of habitability,
the court would determine if a breach has occurred.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the court determines that a
breach of the implied warranty of habitability has occurred, the court would:</p>

transferred to an administrator or receiver, control over the disbursement of
amounts deposited with the court would be transferred to the administrator or
