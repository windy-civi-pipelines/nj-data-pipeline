(2) bring a civil action in accordance with subsection c. of this section; (3) levy a civil administrative penalty in accordance with subsection d. of this section; or (4) bring an action for a civil penalty in accordance with subsection e. of this section. b.  Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated this act, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, the commissioner may issue an order specifying the provision or provisions of this act, or the rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, of which the person is in violation, citing the action that constituted the violation, ordering abatement of the violation, and giving notice to the person of the person's right to a hearing on the matters contained in the order.  The ordered person shall have 20 calendar days from receipt of the order within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order.  If no hearing is requested, the order shall become final after the expiration of the 20-day period.  A request for hearing shall not automatically stay the effect of the order. c.  The commissioner may institute an action or proceeding in the Superior Court for injunctive and other relief to enforce the provisions of this act, and to prohibit and prevent a violation of this act, or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, and the court may proceed in the action in a summary manner.  In any such proceeding the court may grant temporary or interlocutory relief. Such relief may include, singly or in combination: (1) a temporary or permanent injunction; (2) assessment of the violator for the reasonable costs of any inspection that led to the establishment of the violation, and for the reasonable costs of preparing and litigating the case under this subsection. d.  The commissioner may assess a civil administrative penalty of not more than $7,500 for a first offense, not more than $10,000 for a second offense and not more than $25,000 for a third and every subsequent offense.  Each day that a violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  No assessment may be levied pursuant to this section until after the violator has been notified by certified mail or personal service.  The notice shall include a reference to the section of the statute, rule, regulation, or order violated, a concise statement of the facts alleged to constitute a violation, a statement of the amount of the civil administrative penalties to be imposed, and a statement of the person's right to a hearing.  The ordered person shall have 20 calendar days from receipt of the notice within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine specified in the notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a final order after the expiration of the 20-day period.  Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order.  The authority to levy a civil administrative penalty is in addition to all other enforcement provisions in this act, and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied.  The commissioner may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this subsection in an amount the commissioner determines appropriate. e.  A person who violates this act, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, shall be liable for a penalty of not more than $7,500 per day, to be collected in a civil action commenced by the commissioner.  A person who violates an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection b. of this section, or a court order issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or who fails to pay an administrative assessment in full pursuant to subsection d. of this section is subject upon order of a court to a civil penalty not to exceed $50,000 per day of each violation.  Any penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected, with costs, in a summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  The Superior Court and the municipal court shall have jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999" in connection with this act. f.  Pursuit of any of the remedies specified under this section shall not preclude the seeking of any other remedy specified. 6.  The department shall, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt rules and regulations as necessary to implement this act. 7.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would prohibit persons from engaging in scrap tire collection unless they possess a license issued by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The bill would define "scrap tire collection" to mean the pick-up and transportation of scrap tires from their source to a licensed scrap tire facility, disposal facility, storage facility, or other destination.  The bill would require the DEP to establish a scrap hauler license, including an application process and eligibility requirements for applicants.  The bill would require the DEP to establish a system for the manifesting, tracking, collection, recycling, and disposal of scrap tires, and would authorize the DEP to require licensed scrap tire haulers to utilize the system. The bill would establish various requirements for obtaining a scrap tire hauler license, including that each tire hauler would be required to maintain financial assurance in the amount of no less than $150,000 per hauler.  The bill would also prohibit licensed tire haulers from storing tires at any location unless the location meets all applicable safety, environmental, and regulatory requirements established by the DEP. The bill would also require the DEP to establish a permit for scrap tire storage, collection, or disposal sites.  The bill would require that these sites maintain adequate financial assurance for closure as a condition of approval, in an amount sufficient to ensure proper cleanup and site restoration in the event of abandonment or noncompliance. The bill would also establish certain exemptions from the permit requirement, including for persons who store fewer than 1,000 in secure, enclosed containers. The bill would establish a civil administrative penalty of not more than $7,500 for a first offense, not more than $10,000 for a second offense, and not more than $25,000 for a third and every subsequent offense, for violations of the bill's provisions.  The bill would also establish a civil penalty of up to $7,500 for violations of the bill's provisions, and a civil penalty of up to $50,000 for persons who fail to obey administrative orders, court orders, or to pay civil administrative penalties in full.  The penalties would be assessed for each day during which the violations continued.
