cleaning and disinfection and may recover the costs of the cleaning and
disinfection from the owner.  In addition to any civil penalty as may apply, an
owner who knowingly fails to comply with an order issued under this subsection
shall be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.  It shall not be a defense to
a violation of this paragraph that the owner designated an operator for the
cooling tower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
registration, inspection, testing, cleaning, and disinfection of cooling
towers.  Cooling towers, which use a recirculated water system, are associated
with outbreaks of Legionnaires Disease, a respiratory condition characterized
by pneumonia-like symptoms which can, in severe cases, result in death. 
Legionnaires Disease is caused by contamination with Legionella bacteria,
which grow in water and are spread through inhalation of contaminated mist or
vapor.  It is the sponsors belief that establishing requirements for the
inspection, testing, cleaning, and disinfection of cooling towers will help
prevent future outbreaks of Legionnaires Disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the owner of a
building at which a cooling tower is located will be required to register the
cooling tower with the Department of Health (DOH) prior to initial operation of
the cooling tower or, in the case of a currently-existing cooling tower, within
30 days of the effective date of the bill.  The registration will include the owners
contact information and details concerning the cooling towers specifications. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The owner will additionally be
required to meet certain requirements for inspecting, testing, cleaning, and
disinfecting the cooling tower, and will be required to develop and implement a
maintenance program and plan for the cooling tower consistent with the
manufacturers instructions and with the current standards and guidelines
published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and
Air-Conditioning Engineers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the owner will
be required to ensure that a cooling tower that has been shut down for more
than five days is cleaned and disinfected no more than 15 days before the tower
is put into use, and that each cooling tower is inspected and tested for
evidence of organic material, biofilm, algae, and other visible contaminants,
as well as microbial contamination, at least once every three months during any
period of the year during which the cooling tower is in use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The owner will be required to certify
to DOH that the inspection, testing, cleaning, and disinfection requirements
have been met no later than November 1 of each year.  The owner will be
required to maintain records of inspections, tests, cleanings, and
disinfections for three years, and will be required to maintain a copy of the
maintenance program and plan on the premises at all times.  The records and
maintenance documents will be made available for DOH inspection at any time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An owner who fails to meet the
registration, inspection, testing, cleaning, disinfection, certification, or
recordkeeping requirements of the bill will be liable to a civil penalty of not
more than $2,000 for a first violation and not more than $5,000 for a second or
subsequent violation, except that the owner will be liable to a civil penalty
of not more than $10,000 for any violation which leads to the serious injury or
death of any person.  Penalties will be recovered by and in the name of the
Commissioner of Health and will be paid by the commissioner into the treasury
of the State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, when testing
detects levels of microbes that indicate a maintenance deficiency requiring
mitigation, the owner will be required to clean and disinfect the cooling tower
within 48 hours; when test results indicate levels of microbes that present a
serious health threat, the owner will be required to notify DOH and clean and
disinfect the cooling tower within 24 hours.  If an owner does not clean and
disinfect the cooling tower within these time limits, the department may serve
an order on the owner requiring compliance within a specified time.  If the
owner does not comply with the order, the department may complete the required
cleaning and disinfection and may recover the costs of cleaning and
disinfection from the owner.  In addition, an owner who knowingly fails to
comply with an order would be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree, which is
punishable by imprisonment for up to 18 months, up to a $10,000 fine, or both. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that the
inspection, testing, cleaning, and disinfection of a cooling tower, and the
development of a maintenance program and plan for the cooling tower, be
conducted by or under the supervision of a qualified person.  The owner of a
building would be permitted to designate a qualified operator to carry out the
inspection, testing, cleaning, and disinfecting requirements; however, the
owner would be solely liable for any civil or criminal penalties for a
violation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the owner of a building
where a cooling tower is located removes or permanently discontinues use of a
cooling tower, the owner will be required to notify DOH within 30 days, and
include with the notice a statement that the cooling tower has been drained and
sanitized.  The owner will thereafter not be required to meet the requirements
of the bill with respect to that cooling tower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The department will be
permitted to establish reasonable fees for the registration, discontinuation of
use, and annual certification of cooling towers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner will be
required to annually report to the Governor and to the Legislature concerning
compliance with the requirements of the bill, including the number of reported
tests that found microbes at levels that present a serious health threat, the
number of cases of Legionnaires disease reported in each of the previous 10
years, and the commissioners recommendations for further legislative action.</p>
