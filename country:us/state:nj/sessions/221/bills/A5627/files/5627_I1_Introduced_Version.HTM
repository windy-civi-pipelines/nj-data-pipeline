costs.  Of the monies deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture
and Horticulture Fund, not more than fifteen percent can be utilized by the
trust for organizational, administrative and other work and services, including
salaries, equipment, and materials necessary to administer the bills
provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would allow
counties and municipalities to utilize open space trust funds for the
additional purpose of acquiring lands in urban areas of the State for
agricultural or horticultural purposes.  Under current law, counties are
authorized to establish County Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and
Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds and municipalities are
authorized to establish Municipal Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain
Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds. This bill
would expand this authorization to specifically include the acquisition and
stewardship of lands in urban areas of the State for agricultural or
horticultural purposes and would revise the names of these open space trust
funds to include urban agriculture and horticulture.</p>
