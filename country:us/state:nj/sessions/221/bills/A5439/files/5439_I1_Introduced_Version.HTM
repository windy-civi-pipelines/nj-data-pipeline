<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Electric Facility Needs
Assessment</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires an electric
public utility to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity
(certificate) from the board prior to constructing an electric facility. 
Specifically, under the bill, one year prior to submitting a formal application
for a certificate, an electric public utility is to submit a notice of intent
to the board, which notice, once received, is to mark the beginning of the
early assessment stage of the certificate process.  After receiving the notice,
the board is to hold public hearings in the area served by the electric public
utility to:  (1) solicit feedback from the public; (2) provide advice to the
electric public utility regarding certain aspects of the proposed facility; and
(3) analyze how the proposed electric facility will impact the State and serve
the public interest.  In the early assessment stage, the board is to publish
interim reports on the progress of its analysis of the proposed electric
facility.  Moreover, no later than nine months after receiving the notice of
intent, the board is to publish a comprehensive report addressing any major
concerns regarding the proposed electric facility that were raised during the
early assessment stage and comparing the proposed electric facility with
feasible alternatives.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a certificate application
is to include any information that the board deems necessary.  The bill
requires the board, while reviewing the application based on certain criteria
outlined in the bill, to determine whether a proposed electric facility is
necessary to meet the projected need for electricity in the area served by the
electric public utility and that no more efficient, economical, or
environmentally-sound alternative exists.  In addition, the bill authorizes the
board to charge and collect a nonrefundable application fee of no more than
$250,000 for the filing, processing, and review of a certificate application
and for the boards review of certificate renewal applications.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Once the board receives a
completed application, the board is to forward a copy of the application to
other appropriate State departments, agencies, and instrumentalities (State
entities) for additional review.  These State entities are to develop and
forward recommendations on the application to the board and the electric public
utility within 120 days of receiving a copy of the application.  The State
entities are to base their recommendations on the same criteria used by the
board in the boards review of the application.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon receiving a completed
application, the board is to also transmit the application and all supporting
documents, including the boards comprehensive report from the early assessment
stage, to the Office of Administrative Law, which is to conduct a hearing on
the application pursuant to the provisions of current law.  Within six months
of receiving a decision from the presiding administrative law judge, the board
shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application and support its
determination with a written report that is to address certain matters
regarding the proposed electric facility.  If the board conditionally approves
the application, the bill requires the board to provide the electric public
utility with a clear statement of conditions to be met for approval.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a certificate
is to be valid for three years and eligible for renewal subject to the boards
review.  If a certificate renewal application is denied, the electric public
utility holding the certificate may either: (1) continue the project; or (2)
terminate or alter the project under terms and conditions established by the
board.  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Electric Public Utility Accident
Fault Determination</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, if an electric
public utility files for a rate increase to recover costs in excess of $10 million
attributable to an accident at an electric generating or transmission facility
in which the electric public utility has a full or partial interest, the board
is to conduct a hearing or series of hearings to investigate all circumstances
related to the accident and to determine fault, if any, related to the
accident.  The bill stipulates that fault is to be assigned to any party whose
negligent actions or omissions either contributed substantially to causing the
accident or failed to mitigate its severity.  Under the bill, in determining
fault, the board is to consider any credible, fair, and public assessments
rendered by certain, appropriate federal entities.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits the board
from authorizing an electric public utility that is determined by the board to
be at fault to recover any fault-related repair costs, cleanup costs,
additional incremental costs for purchased power, or damage costs resulting
from an accident at an electric generating or transmission facility.  However,
the bill does require the board to consider whether and, if so, to what extent
an electric public utility is permitted to mitigate denied fault costs through
certain measures outlined in the bill.  The bill establishes various
restrictions for these cost mitigation measures but clarifies that nothing in
the bill is to prevent the board from granting interim relief necessary to
enable the electric public utility to provide safe, adequate, and proper
service.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill
prohibits the board from authorizing an electric public utility to include, as
an operating expense, any percentage of the repair, cleanup, or damage costs
resulting from an accident at an electric generating or transmission facility
greater than the electric public utilitys percentage of ownership in the generating
or transmission facility.  The board is required to authorize as an operating
expense, regardless of fault, any cost that the board certifies as appropriate
to contribute to national cost-sharing formulas under federal law or voluntary
cost-sharing plans under certain circumstances outlined in the bill.  However,
the bill provides that the authorization to recover these costs does not
absolve the electric public utility from any assessment of fault or its
obligation under the remedy imposed by the board.  </p>
