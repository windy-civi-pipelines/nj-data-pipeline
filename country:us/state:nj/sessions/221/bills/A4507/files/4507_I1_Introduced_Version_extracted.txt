(cf: P.L.2008, c.30, s.1) 14.  N.J.S.2C:44-5 is amended to read as follows: 2C:44-5.  Multiple Sentences; Concurrent and Consecutive Terms. a.     Sentences of imprisonment for more than one offense.  When multiple sentences of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant for more than one offense, including an offense for which a previous suspended sentence or sentence of probation has been revoked, such multiple sentences shall run concurrently or consecutively as the court determines at the time of sentence, except that: (1)   The aggregate of consecutive terms to a county institution shall not exceed 18 months; and (2)   Not more than one sentence for an extended term shall be imposed. There shall be no overall outer limit on the cumulation of consecutive sentences for multiple offenses. b.    Sentences of imprisonment imposed at different times. When a defendant who has previously been sentenced to imprisonment is subsequently sentenced to another term for an offense committed prior to the former sentence, other than an offense committed while in custody: (1)   The multiple sentences imposed shall so far as possible conform to subsection a. of this section; and (2)   Whether the court determines that the terms shall run concurrently or consecutively, the defendant shall be credited with time served in imprisonment on the prior sentence in determining the permissible aggregate length of the term or terms remaining to be served; and (3)   When a new sentence is imposed on a prisoner who is on parole, the balance of the parole term on the former sentence shall not be deemed to run during the period of the new imprisonment unless the court determines otherwise at the time of sentencing. c.     Sentence of imprisonment for offense committed while on parole. When a defendant is sentenced to imprisonment for an offense committed while on parole in this State, such term of imprisonment and any period of reimprisonment that the parole board may require the defendant to serve upon the revocation of his parole shall run consecutively unless the court orders these sentences to run concurrently. d.    Multiple sentences of imprisonment in other cases. Except as otherwise provided in this section, multiple terms of imprisonment shall run concurrently or consecutively as the court determines when the second or subsequent sentence is imposed. e.     Calculation of concurrent and consecutive terms of imprisonment. (1)   When terms of imprisonment run concurrently, the shorter terms merge in and are satisfied by discharge of the longest term. (2)   When terms of imprisonment run consecutively, the terms are added to arrive at an aggregate term to be served equal to the sum of all terms. f.     Suspension of sentence or probation and imprisonment; multiple terms of suspension and probation. When a defendant is sentenced for more than one offense or a defendant already under sentence is sentenced for another offense committed prior to the former sentence:         (1)        The court shall not sentence to probation a defendant who is under sentence of imprisonment, except as authorized by paragraph (2) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-2; (2)   Multiple periods of suspension or probation shall run consecutively, unless the court orders these sentences to run concurrently from the date of the first such disposition; (3)   When a sentence of imprisonment in excess of one year is imposed, the service of such sentence shall satisfy a suspended sentence on another count or prior suspended sentence or sentence to probation, unless the suspended sentence or probation has been violated in which case any imprisonment for the violation shall run consecutively; and (4)   When a sentence of imprisonment of one year or less is imposed, the period of a suspended sentence on another count or a prior suspended sentence or sentence to probation shall run during the period of such imprisonment, unless the suspended sentence or probation has been violated in which case any imprisonment for the violation shall run consecutively. g.    Offense committed while under suspension of sentence or probation.  When a defendant is convicted of an offense committed while under suspension of sentence or on probation and such suspension or probation is not revoked: (1)   If the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment in excess of one year, the service of such sentence shall not satisfy the prior suspended sentence or sentence to probation, unless the court determines otherwise at the time of sentencing; (2)   If the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment of one year or less, the period of the suspension or probation shall not run during the period of such imprisonment; and (3)   If sentence is suspended or the defendant is sentenced to probation, the period of such suspension or probation shall run concurrently with or consecutively to the remainder of the prior periods, as the court determines at the time of sentence. h.    Offense committed while released pending disposition of a previous offense.  When a defendant is sentenced to imprisonment for an offense committed while released, with or without bail, pending disposition of a previous offense, the term of imprisonment shall run consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment imposed for the previous offense, unless the court, in consideration of the character and conditions of the defendant, finds that imposition of consecutive sentences would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others. i.     Sentence of imprisonment for assault on corrections employee.  Any term of imprisonment imposed on an [inmate] incarcerated person of a State or county correctional facility for an assault on a Department of Corrections employee, an employee of a county correctional facility, an employee of a State juvenile facility or a county juvenile detention facility, county sheriffs department employee or any State, county or municipal law enforcement officer while in the performance of his duties shall run consecutively to any term of imprisonment currently being served and to any other term imposed for any other offense committed at the time of the assault.

The use of isolated confinement in correctional facilities in this State shall be limited as follows: (1)   Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of subsection d. of this section, an [inmate] incarcerated person shall not be placed in isolated confinement unless there is reasonable cause to believe that the [inmate] incarcerated person would create a substantial risk of serious harm to himself or another, including but not limited to a correctional police officer or other employee or volunteer in the facility, as evidenced by recent threats or conduct, and a less restrictive intervention would be insufficient to reduce this risk.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of subsection d. of this section, the correctional facility shall bear the burden of establishing this standard by clear and convincing evidence. (2)   Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of subsection d. of this section, an [inmate] incarcerated person shall not be placed in isolated confinement for non-disciplinary reasons. (3)   Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (1) of subsection d. of this section, an [inmate] incarcerated person shall not be placed in isolated confinement before receiving a personal and comprehensive medical and mental health examination conducted by a clinician; however, in a county correctional facility, a preliminary examination shall be conducted by a member of the medical staff within 12 hours of confinement and the clinical examination shall be conducted within 48 hours of confinement, but if staffing levels require, the period for conducting a clinical examination may be extended to 72 hours of confinement.

(15) An [inmate] incarcerated person shall not be held in isolated confinement based on the [inmates] incarcerated persons race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, domestic partnership or civil union status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy or breastfeeding status, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait. b.    Except as otherwise provided in subsection d. of this section, an [inmate] incarcerated person who is a member of a vulnerable population shall not be placed in isolated confinement. c.     An [inmate] incarcerated person shall not be placed in isolated confinement or in any other cell or other holding or living space, in any facility, with one or more [inmates] incarcerated persons if there is reasonable cause to believe that there is a risk of harm or harassment, intimidation, extortion, or other physical or emotional abuse to that [inmate] incarcerated person or another [inmate] incarcerated person in that placement. d.    Isolated confinement shall be permitted under limited circumstances as follows: (1)   The facility administrator or designated shift commander determines that a facility-wide lock down is required to ensure the safety of [inmates] incarcerated persons in the facility until the administrator or shift commander determines that these circumstances no longer exist.  The facility administrator or shift commander shall document specific reasons why any lockdown is necessary for more than 24 hours, and why less restrictive interventions are insufficient to accomplish the facility's safety goals.  Within 15 days the commissioner shall publish the reasons on the Department of Corrections website and provide meaningful notice of the reasons for the lockdown to the Legislature. (2)   The facility administrator determines that an [inmate] incarcerated person should be placed in emergency confinement, provided that: (a)   an [inmate] incarcerated person shall not be held in emergency confinement for more than 24 hours; and (b)   an [inmate] incarcerated person held in emergency confinement in a State correctional facility shall receive an initial medical and mental health evaluation immediately prior to placement in emergency confinement and a personal and comprehensive medical and mental health evaluation within 24 hours.  The examination shall be conducted by a member of the medical staff within 12 hours of confinement and the comprehensive medical and mental health evaluation within 72 hours.  Reports of these evaluations shall be immediately provided to the facility administrator.

(b)   The [inmate] incarcerated person may be placed in involuntary protective custody only when there is clear and convincing evidence that confinement is necessary to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm and that a less restrictive intervention would not be sufficient to prevent the harm. (c)   An [inmate] incarcerated person placed in protective custody shall receive similar opportunities for activities, movement, and social interaction, consistent with their safety and the safety of others, as are [inmates] incarcerated persons in the general population of the facility. (d)   An [inmate] incarcerated person subject to removal from protective custody shall be provided with a timely, fair, and meaningful opportunity to contest the removal. (e)   An [inmate] incarcerated person who may be placed or currently is in voluntary protective custody may opt out of that status by providing informed, voluntary, written refusal of that status. (f)   The facility administrator shall place an [inmate] incarcerated person in a less restrictive intervention, including transfer to the general population of another institution or to a special-purpose housing unit for [inmates] incarcerated persons who face similar threats, before placing the [inmate] incarcerated person in isolated confinement for protection unless the [inmate] incarcerated person poses a security risk so great that transferring the [inmate] incarcerated person would be insufficient to ensure the [inmates] incarcerated persons safety.

By the same method, any [inmate] incarcerated person of a correctional institution maintained by the State, on the initiative of the commissioner, may be transferred, with the consent of the board of chosen freeholders, to an appropriate correctional institution in any one of the several counties. In the event it is determined by the Commissioner of Corrections that a county jail, workhouse or penitentiary is not suitable or adequate to properly secure any [inmate] incarcerated person under sentence or charged with any criminal offense, he may transfer the [inmate] incarcerated person to any existing correctional institution maintained by the State, including the State Prison.  The Commissioner of Corrections shall be empowered to determine a specific State correctional institution, including the State Prison, for the proper and secure incarceration of the [inmate] incarcerated person. Any person so transferred may be retransferred to his place of original confinement or may be transferred to any existing jail, workhouse or penitentiary located in any one of the several counties.  The cost of such transfer and the expense of maintaining the [inmate] incarcerated person in any State institution or an institution located in a county other than the county from which the [inmate] incarcerated person was originally committed and confined shall be borne by the State.

(cf: P.L.2019, c.364, s.7) 46.  Section 7 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.51) is amended to read as follows: 7.  a. Each adult [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a term of incarceration in a county penal institution, or to a specific term of years at the State Prison or the correctional institution for women shall become primarily eligible for parole after having served any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term, or one-third of the sentence imposed where no mandatory minimum term has been imposed less commutation time for good behavior pursuant to N.J.S.2A:164-24 or R.S.30:4-140 and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments pursuant to P.L.1972, c.115 (C.30:8-28.1 et seq.) or R.S.30:4-92. Consistent with the provisions of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice (N.J.S.2C:11-3, 2C:14-6, 2C:43-6, 2C:43-7), commutation and work credits shall not in any way reduce any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term and such credits accrued shall only be awarded subsequent to the expiration of the term. b.    Each adult [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a term of life imprisonment shall become primarily eligible for parole after having served any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term, or 25 years where no mandatory minimum term has been imposed less commutation time for good behavior and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments.  If an [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a specific term or terms of years is eligible for parole on a date later than the date upon which he would be eligible if a life sentence had been imposed, then in such case the [inmate] incarcerated person shall be eligible for parole after having served 25 years, less commutation time for good behavior and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments.  Consistent with the provisions of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice (N.J.S.2C:11-3, 2C:14-6, 2C:43-6, 2C:43-7), commutation and work credits shall not in any way reduce any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term and such credits accrued shall only be awarded subsequent to the expiration of the term. c.     Each adult [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a specific term of years pursuant to the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act, P.L.1970, c.226 (C.24:21-1 et al.) shall become primarily eligible for parole after having served one-third of the sentence imposed less commutation time for good behavior and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments. d.    Each adult [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to an indeterminate term of years as a young adult offender pursuant to N.J.S.2C:43-5 shall become primarily eligible for parole consideration pursuant to a schedule of primary eligibility dates developed by the board, less adjustment for program participation.  In no case shall the board schedule require that the primary parole eligibility date for a young adult offender be greater than the primary parole eligibility date required pursuant to this section for the presumptive term for the crime authorized pursuant to subsection f. of N.J.S.2C:44-1. e.     Each adult [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced for an offense specified in N.J.S.2C:47-1 shall become primarily eligible for parole as follows: (1)   If the court finds that the offenders conduct was not characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior or finds that the offender is not amenable to sex offender treatment, or if after sentencing the Department of Corrections in its most recent examination determines that the offender is not amenable to sex offender treatment, the offender shall become primarily eligible for parole after having served any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term or one-third of the sentence imposed where no mandatory minimum term has been imposed.  Neither such term shall be reduced by commutation time for good behavior pursuant to R.S.30:4-140 or credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments pursuant to R.S.30:4-92. (2)   Young adult offenders shall be eligible for parole pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.2C:47-5, except no offender shall become primarily eligible for parole prior to the expiration of any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term. f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) g.    Each adult [inmate of] incarcerated person in a county jail, workhouse, or penitentiary shall become primarily eligible for parole upon service of 60 days of his aggregate sentence or as provided for in subsection a. of this section, whichever is greater.  Whenever any such [inmates] incarcerated persons parole eligibility is within six months of the date of such sentence, the judge shall state such eligibility on the record which shall satisfy all public and [inmate] incarcerated person notice requirements.  The chief executive officer of the institution in which county [inmates] incarcerated persons are held shall generate all reports pursuant to subsection d. of section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54).  The parole board shall have the authority to promulgate time periods applicable to the parole processing of [inmates of] incarcerated persons in county penal institutions, except that no [inmate] incarcerated person may be released prior to the primary eligibility date established by this subsection, unless consented to by the sentencing judge.  No [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a specific term of years at the State Prison or the correctional institution for women shall become primarily eligible for parole until service of a full nine months of his aggregate sentence. h.    When an [inmate] incarcerated person is sentenced to more than one term of imprisonment, the primary parole eligibility terms calculated pursuant to this section shall be aggregated by the board for the purpose of determining the primary parole eligibility date.  The board shall promulgate rules and regulations to govern aggregation under this subsection. i.     The primary eligibility date shall be computed by a designated representative of the board and made known to the [inmate] incarcerated person in writing not later than 90 days following the commencement of the sentence.  In the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a county penal institution such notice shall be made pursuant to subsection g. of this section.  Each [inmate] incarcerated person shall be given the opportunity to acknowledge in writing the receipt of such computation.  Failure or refusal by the [inmate] incarcerated person to acknowledge the receipt of such computation shall be recorded by the board but shall not constitute a violation of this subsection. j.     Except as provided in this subsection, each [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced pursuant to N.J.S.2A:113-4 for a term of life imprisonment, N.J.S.2A:164-17 for a fixed minimum and maximum term or subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:1-1 shall not be primarily eligible for parole on a date computed pursuant to this section, but shall be primarily eligible on a date computed pursuant to P.L.1948, c.84 (C.30:4-123.1 et seq.), which is continued in effect for this purpose.  [Inmates] Incarcerated persons classified as second, third or fourth offenders pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1948, c.84 (C.30:4-123.12) shall become primarily eligible for parole after serving one-third, one-half, or two-thirds of the maximum sentence imposed, respectively, less in each instance commutation time for good behavior and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments; provided, however, that if the prosecuting attorney or the sentencing court advises the board that the punitive aspects of the sentence imposed on such [inmates] incarcerated persons will not have been fulfilled by the time of parole eligibility calculated pursuant to this subsection, then the [inmate] incarcerated person shall not become primarily eligible for parole until serving an additional period which shall be one-half of the difference between the primary parole eligibility date calculated pursuant to this subsection and the parole eligibility date calculated pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1948, c.84 (C.30:4-123.12).  If the prosecuting attorney or the sentencing court advises the board that the punitive aspects of the sentence have not been fulfilled, such advice need not be supported by reasons and will be deemed conclusive and final.  Any such decision shall not be subject to judicial review except to the extent mandated by the New Jersey and United States Constitutions.  The board shall, reasonably prior to considering any such case, advise the prosecuting attorney and the sentencing court of all information relevant to such [inmates] incarcerated persons  parole eligibility. k.    Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, a person sentenced to imprisonment pursuant to paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:11-3 shall not be eligible for parole. l.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections a. through j. of this section, the appropriate board panel, as provided in section 1 of P.L.1997, c.214 (C.30:4-123.51c), may release an [inmate] incarcerated person serving a sentence of imprisonment on medical parole at any time. (cf: P.L.2019, c.363, s.10) 47.  Section 1 of P.L.2020, c.106 (C.30:4-123.51e) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a. Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45 et seq.) to the contrary, the court may release an [inmate] incarcerated person who qualifies under this section for compassionate release at any time during the term of incarceration.  An [inmate] incarcerated person granted compassionate release pursuant to this section shall be subject to custody, supervision, and conditions as provided in section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59) and shall be subject to sanctions for a violation of a condition of compassionate release as if on parole as provided in sections 16 through 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through 30:4-123.65). b.    The Commissioner of Corrections shall establish and maintain a process by which an [inmate] incarcerated person may obtain a medical diagnosis to determine whether the [inmate] incarcerated person is eligible for compassionate release.  The medical diagnosis shall be made by two licensed physicians designated by the commissioner.  The diagnosis shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   a description of the terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or permanent physical incapacity; (2)   a prognosis concerning the likelihood of recovery from the terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or permanent physical incapacity; (3)   a description of the [inmates] incarcerated persons physical incapacity, if appropriate; and (4)   a description of the type of ongoing treatment that would be required if the [inmate] incarcerated person is granted compassionate release. c.     A medical diagnosis to determine whether an [inmate] incarcerated person is eligible for compassionate release under this section may be initiated by the administrator, superintendent, or a staff member of a correctional facility or, upon request, submitted to the Commissioner of Corrections by the [inmate] incarcerated person, a member of the [inmates] incarcerated persons family, or the [inmates] incarcerated persons attorney.  The request shall be submitted in a manner and form prescribed by the Commissioner of Corrections. d. (1) In the event that a medical diagnosis determines that an [inmate] incarcerated person is suffering from a grave medical condition as defined in subsection l. of this section, the Department of Corrections shall promptly notify the [inmates] incarcerated persons attorney or, if the [inmate] incarcerated person does not have an attorney, the Public Defender, to initiate the process of petitioning for compassionate release.  The petition shall not be filed until a subsequent medical diagnosis determines that the [inmate] incarcerated person is suffering from a terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or a permanent physical incapacity as defined in subsection l. of this section and the Department of Corrections issues to the [inmate] incarcerated person a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release. (2)   In the event that a medical diagnosis determines that an [inmate] incarcerated person is suffering from a terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or permanent physical incapacity as defined in subsection l. of this section, the Department of Corrections shall promptly issue to the [inmate] incarcerated person a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release and provide a copy of the certificate to the [inmates] incarcerate persons attorney or, if the [inmate] incarcerated person does not have an attorney, the Public Defender.  An [inmate] incarcerated person who receives a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release may petition the court for compassionate release. (3)   In the event of a medical diagnosis that an [inmate] incarcerated person is suffering from a grave medical condition or upon issuance of a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release, an [inmate] incarcerated person may request representation from the Office of the Public Defender for the purpose of filing a petition for compassionate release. e.     A petition for compassionate release shall be filed with the Superior Court. (1)   The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition in accordance with the Rules of Court on the county prosecutor who prosecuted the matter or, if the matter was prosecuted by the Attorney General, the Attorney General. (2)   The county prosecutor or the Attorney General, as the case may be, shall provide notice of the petition to any victim or member of the family of a victim entitled to notice relating to a parole or the consideration of a parole under the provisions of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45 et seq.), and shall notify the victim or family member of the opportunity to present a statement at the hearing on the petition or to testify to the court concerning any harm suffered by the victim or family member at the time of the hearing. (3)   Upon receipt of notice of the petition, the victim or member of the family of the victim, as the case may be, may submit any comments to the court within 15 days following receipt of notice of the petition, including but not limited to advising the court of an intent to testify at the hearing. (4)   The information contained in the petition and the contents of any comments submitted by a recipient in response thereto shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person who is not authorized to receive or review the information or comments. (5)   If a recipient of a notice of the petition does not submit comments or advise the court of an intent to testify at the hearing within the 15-day period following receipt of the notice of the petition, the court may presume that the recipient does not wish to submit comments and proceed with its consideration of the petition. (6)   The prosecutor shall have 15 days to respond to the petition, which period may be extended to 30 days for good cause shown. (7)   If the court receives from the prosecutor a response objecting to the petition or is notified that a victim or a family member intends to testify to the court at the hearing, the court shall hold a hearing on the petition on an expedited basis in accordance with the Rules of Court and procedures established by the Administrative Director of the Courts.  If the court does not, within the time frames established under this subsection, receive a response from the prosecutor objecting to the petition and is not notified of an intent for a victim or family member to testify, the court may make a determination on the petition without holding a hearing.  Notice given under the provisions of this subsection shall be in lieu of any other notice of parole consideration required under P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45 et seq.). Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair the right of any party to be heard pursuant to P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45 et seq.). f. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of section 9 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.53), the court may order the compassionate release of an [inmate] incarcerated person who has been issued a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the [inmate] incarcerated person is so debilitated or incapacitated by the terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or permanent physical incapacity as to be permanently physically incapable of committing a crime if released and, in the case of a permanent physical incapacity, the conditions established in accordance with subsection h. of this section under which the [inmate] incarcerated person would be released would not pose a threat to public safety. (2)   No petition for compassionate release may be submitted to the court unless it is accompanied by a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section.  The court may summarily dismiss a petition for compassionate release if the petition is submitted without a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release. (3)   The court shall provide to the [inmate] incarcerated person and the county prosecutor or Attorney General, as the case may be, written notice of its decision setting forth the reasons for granting or denying compassionate release, and the county prosecutor or Attorney General, as the case may be, shall notify any victim or member of a victims family who received notification pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection e. of this section of the outcome of the court's decision. g.    An order by the court granting a petition for compassionate release shall not become final for 10 days in order to permit the prosecution to appeal the court's order. h.    Whenever an [inmate] incarcerated person is granted compassionate release pursuant to this section, the court shall require, as a condition precedent to release, the State Parole Board to ensure that the [inmates] incarcerated persons release plan includes: (1)   identification of a community sponsor; (2)   verification of the availability of appropriate medical services sufficient to meet the treatment requirements identified pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection b. of this section; and (3)   verification of appropriate housing which may include, but need not be limited to, a hospital, hospice, nursing home facility, or other housing accommodation suitable to the [inmates] incarcerated persons medical condition, disease or syndrome, or permanent physical incapacity. The Commissioner of Corrections shall ensure that any [inmate] incarcerated person who petitions for compassionate release is provided an opportunity to apply, and is provided necessary assistance to complete the application, for medical assistance benefits under the Medicaid program established pursuant to P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.) prior to any determination of ineligibility by the court as a result of the inability to verify the availability of appropriate medical services, as required pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. i.     In addition to any conditions imposed pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59), as a condition of compassionate release, the State Parole Board may require an [inmate] incarcerated person to submit to periodic medical diagnoses by a licensed physician. j.     If, after review of a medical diagnosis required under the provisions of subsection i. of this section, the State Parole Board determines that a parolee granted compassionate release is no longer so debilitated or incapacitated by a terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or by a permanent physical incapacity as to be physically incapable of committing a crime or, in the case of a permanent physical incapacity, the parolee poses a threat to public safety, the State Parole Board shall so notify the prosecutor, who may initiate proceedings to return the [inmate] incarcerated person to confinement in an appropriate facility designated by the Commissioner of Corrections. The prosecutor shall provide notice of the request to return the parolee to confinement to the parolee and the parolees attorney or, if the parolee does not have an attorney, the Public Defender.  The parolee shall have 15 days after receipt of the notice to object to the return to confinement, which period may be extended to 30 days for good cause shown.  If the Superior Court receives from the parolee an objection to the request to return the parolee to confinement, the court shall hold a hearing on an expedited basis in accordance with the Rules of Court and procedures established by the Administrative Director of the Courts to determine whether the parolee should be returned to confinement pursuant to this subsection.  If the court does not receive a timely objection to the return to confinement, the court may make a determination on the request without holding a hearing.  The parolee shall be returned to confinement if the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the parolee poses a threat to public safety because the parolee is no longer debilitated or incapacitated by a terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or by a permanent physical incapacity.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the board, an appropriate board panel, or parole officer of the State Parole Board to address a violation of a condition of parole pursuant to sections 16 through 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through 30:4-123.65). k.    The denial of a petition for compassionate release or the return of a parolee to confinement under the provisions of subsection j. of this section shall not preclude an [inmate] incarcerated person from being considered for parole, if eligible, pursuant to subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.51). l.     For purposes of this section: Grave medical condition means a prognosis by the licensed physicians designated by the Commissioner of Corrections pursuant to subsection b. of this section that an [inmate] incarcerated person has more than six months but not more than 12 months to live or has a medical condition that did not exist at the time of sentencing and for at least three months has rendered the [inmate] incarcerated person unable to perform activities of basic daily living, resulting in the [inmate] incarcerated person requiring 24-hour care. Terminal condition, disease or syndrome means a prognosis by the licensed physicians designated by the Commissioner of Corrections pursuant to subsection b. of this section that an [inmate] incarcerated person has six months or less to live. Permanent physical incapacity means a prognosis by the licensed physicians designated by the Commissioner of Corrections pursuant to subsection b. of this section that an [inmate] incarcerated person has a medical condition that renders the [inmate] incarcerated person permanently unable to perform activities of basic daily living, results in the [inmate] incarcerated person requiring 24-hour care, and did not exist at the time of sentencing. (cf: P.L.2020, c.106, s.1) 48.  Section 8 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.52) is amended to read as follows: 8.  a. If the appropriate board panel determines that an adult [inmate] incarcerated person has seriously or persistently violated specifically defined institutional rules or has engaged in conduct indictable in nature while incarcerated, the [inmates] incarcerated persons parole eligibility date may be increased pursuant to a schedule developed by the board.  In developing such schedule, particular emphasis shall be placed on the severity of the [inmates] incarcerated persons conduct.  The board shall deduct from the scheduled penalty any loss of commutation time imposed by the Department of Corrections pursuant to R.S.30:4-140. b.    If the appropriate board panel determines that an adult [inmate] incarcerated person has made exceptional progress, as evidenced by documented participation and progress in institutional or community educational, training or other programs, the [inmates] incarcerated persons parole eligibility date may be decreased, except that no parole eligibility date shall be set below the primary parole eligibility date without the consent of the sentencing court, which need not conduct a hearing and in no case shall a parole eligibility date be set below any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term, including any parole eligibility date set pursuant to section 23 of this act. c.     The appropriate board panel shall annually monitor the progress of each adult [inmate] incarcerated person and provide the [inmate] incarcerated person with a written statement of any changes in his parole eligibility. d.    At any time while an [inmate] incarcerated person is committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections, the appropriate board panel or the Parole Board may require, as often as it deems necessary, that [inmate] incarcerated person to undergo an in-depth preparole psychological evaluation conducted by a psychologist. e.     Prior to the parole eligibility date of each adult [inmate] incarcerated person, an objective risk assessment shall be performed by board staff or by some other appropriate agent of the State.  The risk assessment, which shall be in a form prescribed by the board pursuant to rule and regulation, shall consist of both static and dynamic factors which may assist the board panel in determining whether the [inmate] incarcerated person shall be certified for parole and, if paroled, the level of supervision the parolee may require.  In addition to the information otherwise gathered for and incorporated in the pre-parole report, the assessment shall include evaluations of the [inmates] incarcerated persons ability to function independently, the [inmates] incarcerated persons educational and employment background, the [inmates] incarcerated persons family and marital history, and such other information and factors as the board may deem appropriate and necessary. (cf: P.L.2001, c.79, s.18) 49.  Section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54) is amended to read as follows: 10.  a. At least 120 days but not more than 180 days prior to the parole eligibility date of each adult [inmate] incarcerated person, a report concerning the [inmate] incarcerated person shall be filed with the appropriate board panel, by the staff members designated by the superintendent or other chief executive officer of the institution in which the [inmate] incarcerated person is held. b. (1) The report filed pursuant to subsection a. shall contain preincarceration records of the [inmate] incarcerated person, including any history of civil commitment, any disposition which arose out of any charges suspended pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-6 including records of the disposition of those charges and any acquittals by reason of insanity pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-1, state the conduct of the [inmate] incarcerated person during the current period of confinement, include a complete report on the [inmates] incarcerated persons social and physical condition, include an investigation by the Division of Parole of the [inmates] incarcerated persons parole plans, and present information bearing upon the likelihood that the [inmate] incarcerated person will commit a crime under the laws of this State if released on parole.  The report shall also include a complete psychological evaluation of the [inmate] incarcerated person in any case in which the [inmate] incarcerated person was convicted of a first or second degree crime involving violence and: (a)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has a prior acquittal by reason of insanity pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-1 or had charges suspended pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-6; or (b)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has a prior conviction for murder pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-3, aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-2, kidnapping pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-1, endangering the welfare of a child which would constitute a crime of the second degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-4, or stalking which would constitute a crime of the third degree pursuant to P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10); or (c)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has a prior diagnosis of psychosis. The [inmate] incarcerated person shall disclose any information concerning any history of civil commitment. The preincarceration records of the [inmate] incarcerated person contained in the report shall include any psychological reports prepared in connection with any court proceedings. (2)   At the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall notify any victim injured as a result of a crime of the first or second degree or the nearest relative of a murder victim of the opportunity to present a written or videotaped statement for the parole report to be considered at the parole hearing or to testify to the parole board concerning his harm at the time of the parole hearing.  Each victim or relative shall be responsible for notifying the board of his intention to submit such a statement and to provide an appropriate mailing address. The report may include a written or videotaped statement concerning the continuing nature and extent of any physical harm or psychological or emotional harm or trauma suffered by the victim, the extent of any loss of earnings or ability to work suffered by the victim and the continuing effect of the crime upon the victims family.  At the time public notice is given that an [inmate] incarcerated person is being considered for parole pursuant to this section, the board shall also notify any victim or nearest relative who has previously contacted the board of the availability to provide a written or videotaped statement for inclusion in the parole report or to present testimony at the parole hearing. The board shall notify the victim or relative at the victims or relatives last known mailing address. (3)   If the [inmate] incarcerated person meets the requirements for administrative parole release pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d) the report shall indicate this eligibility. c.     A copy of the report filed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, excepting those documents which have been classified as confidential pursuant to rules and regulations of the board or the Department of Corrections, shall be served on the [inmate] incarcerated person at the time it is filed with the board panel.  The [inmate] incarcerated person may file with the board panel a written statement regarding the report, but shall do so within 105 days prior to the primary parole eligibility date. d.    Upon receipt of the public notice pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45), a county prosecutor, a public defender, or a private attorney of record may request from the parole board a copy of the report on any adult [inmate] incarcerated person prepared pursuant to subsection a. of this section, which shall be expeditiously forwarded to the county prosecutor by the parole board by mail, courier, or other means of delivery.  Upon receipt of the report, the prosecutor has 10 working days to review the report and notify the parole board of the prosecutor's comments, if any, or notify the parole board of the prosecutors intent to provide comments.  If the county prosecutor does not provide comments or notify the parole board of the prosecutors intent to provide comments within the 10 working days, the parole board may presume that the prosecutor does not wish to provide comments and may proceed with the parole consideration.  Any comments provided by a county prosecutor shall be delivered to the parole board by the same method by which the county prosecutor received the report.  The confidentiality of the contents in a report which are classified as confidential shall be maintained and shall not be disclosed to any person who is not authorized to receive or review a copy of the report containing the confidential information. e.     Any provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, the board shall by rule or regulation modify the scope of the required reports and time periods for rendering such reports with reference to county penal institutions. f.     Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the board may modify the time periods for submitting the reports required pursuant to this section in processing an [inmate] incarcerated person whose parole eligibility date is accelerated pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55). (cf: P.L.2019, c.364, s.9) 50.  Section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55) is amended to read as follows: 11.  a. Prior to the parole eligibility date of each adult [inmate] incarcerated person, a designated hearing officer shall review the reports required by section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54), and shall determine whether: (1)   the [inmate] incarcerated person is eligible for administrative parole release pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d).  If an [inmate] incarcerated person is eligible for administrative parole release, the hearing officer shall at least 60 days prior to the [inmates] incarcerated persons parole eligibility date recommend in writing to the assigned member of the board panel that administrative parole release be granted pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d); or (2)   there is a basis for denial of parole in the preparole report, any risk assessment prepared in accordance with the provisions of subsection e. of section 8 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.52), or the [inmates] incarcerated persons statement, or an indication, reduced to writing, that additional information providing a basis for denial of parole would be developed or produced at a hearing.  If the hearing officer determines that there is no basis in the preparole report, the risk assessment, or the [inmates] incarcerated persons statement for denial of parole and that there is no additional relevant information to be developed or produced at a hearing, he shall at least 60 days prior to the [inmates] incarcerated persons parole eligibility date recommend in writing to the assigned member of the board panel that parole release be granted. b.    If the assigned member of the board panel or in the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a county penal institution, the assigned member concurs in the hearing officers recommendation, he shall certify parole release pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59) as soon as practicable after the eligibility date and so notify the [inmate] incarcerated person and the board.  In the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person recommended for administrative parole release by the hearing officer pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d), the assigned member shall review the reports required by section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54) to confirm eligibility and if the [inmate] incarcerated person is eligible, shall certify parole release pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59) as soon as practicable after the eligibility date and notify the [inmate] incarcerated person and the board.  In the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a county penal institution the board shall certify parole release or deny parole as provided by this section, except with regard to time periods for notice and parole processing which are authorized by or otherwise adopted pursuant to subsection g. of section 7 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.51).  If the designated hearing officer does not recommend release on parole or if the assigned member does not concur in a recommendation of the designated hearing officer in favor of release, then the parole release of an [inmate] incarcerated person in a county penal institution shall be treated under the provisions of law otherwise applicable to an adult [inmate] incarcerated person.  In the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a county penal institution, the performance of public service for the remainder of the term of the sentence shall be a required condition of parole, where appropriate. c.     If the hearing officer or the assigned member determines that there is a basis for denial of parole, or that a hearing is otherwise necessary, the hearing officer or assigned member shall notify the appropriate board panel and the [inmate] incarcerated person in writing of his determination, and of a date for a parole consideration hearing.  The board panel shall notify the victim of the crime, if the crime for which the [inmate] incarcerated person is incarcerated was a crime of the first or second degree, or the victims nearest relative if the crime was murder, as appropriate, who was previously contacted by the board and who has indicated his intention to the board to testify at the hearing, of the opportunity to testify or submit written or videotaped statements at the hearing.  Said hearing shall be conducted by the appropriate board panel at least 30 days prior to the eligibility date.  At the hearing, which shall be informal, the board panel shall receive as evidence any relevant and reliable documents or videotaped or in person testimony, including that of the victim of the crime or the members of the family of a murder victim if the victim or a family member so desires. If a victim of a crime or the relative of a murder victim chooses not to testify personally at the hearing, the victim or relative may elect to present testimony to a senior hearing officer designated by the board panel.  The senior hearing officer shall notify the victim of the right to have this testimony videotaped.  The senior hearing officer shall prepare a report, transcript or videotape, if applicable, of the testimony for presentation to the board panel at the hearing.  All such evidence not classified as confidential pursuant to rules and regulations of the board or the Department of Corrections shall be disclosed to the [inmate] incarcerated person and the [inmate] incarcerated person shall be permitted to rebut such evidence and to present evidence on his own behalf.  The decision of the board panel shall be based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing. d.    At the conclusion of the parole consideration hearing, the board panel shall either (1) certify the parole release of the [inmate] incarcerated person pursuant to section 15 of this act as soon as practicable after the eligibility date and so notify the [inmate] incarcerated person and the board, or (2) deny parole and file with the board within 30 days of the hearing a statement setting forth the decision, the particular reasons therefor, except information classified as confidential pursuant to rules and regulations of the board or the Department of Corrections, a copy of which statement shall be served upon the [inmate] incarcerated person together with notice of his right to appeal to the board. e.     Upon request by the hearing officer or the [inmate] incarcerated person, the time limitations contained in section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54) and this section may be waived by the appropriate board panel for good cause. f.     Notwithstanding the provision of any other law to the contrary, if an [inmate] incarcerated person incarcerated for murder is recommended for parole by the assigned board member or the appropriate board panel, parole shall not be certified until a majority of the full parole board, after conducting a hearing, concurs in that recommendation. The board shall notify the victims family of that hearing and family members shall be afforded the opportunity to testify in person or to submit written or videotaped statements.  The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to an [inmate] incarcerated person who has his parole revoked and is returned to custody pursuant to the provisions of section 19 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.63). g.    Notwithstanding the provision of any other law or regulation to the contrary, the board may promulgate rules and regulations for the processing of any [inmate] incarcerated person whose parole eligibility date is accelerated.  For purposes of this section, a parole eligibility date is accelerated when an [inmate] incarcerated person becomes eligible for parole at the time of or within 120 days of an event or circumstance beyond the control of the parole board, such as sentencing, resentencing or other amendment, including the awarding of additional credit to the original sentence, restoration of authorized institutional time credits or the application of authorized institutional time credits on a future eligibility date established pursuant to subsection a. of section 12 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.56) or subsection a. of section 20 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.64).  The rules and regulations shall provide for the preparation and review of a preparole report and shall require that a parole consideration hearing be held not more than 120 days after the board has received notice that an accelerated parole eligibility date has been established. (cf: P.L.2019, c.364, s.10) 51.  Section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d) is amended to read as follows: 4.  a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of section 9 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.53), an adult [inmate] incarcerated person shall be administratively released on parole at the time of primary or subsequent parole eligibility provided that: (1)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has not been previously convicted of, adjudicated delinquent for, or is currently serving a sentence imposed for any crime enumerated in subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.2C:43-7.2); subsection c. or g. of N.J.S.2C:43-6; subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2); or section 3 of P.L.1998, c.71 (C.30:4-27.26); (2)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has not committed any prohibited acts required to be reported to the prosecutor pursuant to regulations promulgated by the commissioner during the current period of incarceration, and has not committed any serious disciplinary infraction, designated in regulations promulgated by the commissioner as a prohibited act that is considered to be the most serious and results in the most severe sanctions, within the previous two years; (3)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has completed relevant rehabilitation programs, as determined by the Department of Corrections and State Parole Board, available at the correctional facility or applied for but was unable to complete or was denied access to these programs due to circumstances beyond the [inmates] incarcerated persons control including, but not limited to, capacity limitations or exclusionary policies of these programs; and (4)   crime victims have received notification as required by law. b.    In the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person who meets the criteria set forth in this section for administrative parole release, a hearing shall not be required pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55).  An [inmate] incarcerated person released on parole pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall, during the term of parole supervision, remain in the legal custody of the Commissioner of Corrections, be supervised by the Division of Parole of the State Parole Board, and be subject to the provisions and conditions established by the appropriate board panel in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59).  If the parolee violates a condition of parole, the parolee shall be subject to the provisions of sections 16 through 19 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through C.30:4-123.63) and may have his parole revoked and be returned to custody.  If revocation and return to custody are deemed appropriate, the appropriate board panel shall revoke the parolee's release and return the parolee to custody and confinement pursuant to the provisions of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.30:4-123.51b). c.     Denials of administrative parole release shall be appealable in accordance with section 14 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.58). d.    A criminal justice program at a four-year public institution of higher education in this State shall conduct a study of all [inmates] incarcerated persons whose primary parole eligibility date was within the five years immediately preceding the implementation of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55b et al.) and the five years immediately following the implementation of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55b et al.).  The study shall include, but not be limited to, the number of [inmates] incarcerated persons who met the criteria set forth in subsection a. of this section, the number of [inmates] incarcerated persons who did not meet the criteria, and the reasons an [inmate] incarcerated person did not meet the criteria. (cf: P.L.2019, c.364, s.4) 52.  Section 12 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.56) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a. The board shall develop a schedule of future parole eligibility dates for adult [inmates] incarcerated persons denied release at their eligibility date.  In developing such schedule, particular emphasis shall be placed on the severity of the offense for which he was denied parole and on the characteristics of the offender, such as, but not limited to, the prior criminal record of the [inmate] incarcerated person and the need for continued incapacitation of the [inmate] incarcerated person. b.    If the release on the eligibility date is denied, the board panel which conducted the hearing shall refer to the schedule published pursuant to subsection a., and include in its statement denying parole notice of the date of future parole consideration.  If such date differs from the date otherwise established by the schedule, the board panel shall include particular reasons therefor.  The future parole eligibility date shall not be altered to take into account remissions of sentence for good behavior and diligent application to work and other assignments; provided however, the future parole eligibility date may be altered pursuant to section 8 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.52). c.     An [inmate] incarcerated person shall be released on parole on the new parole eligibility date unless information filed pursuant to a procedure identical to that set forth in section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54) indicates by a preponderance of the evidence that the [inmate] incarcerated person has failed to cooperate in his or her own rehabilitation or that there is a reasonable expectation that the [inmate] incarcerated person will violate conditions of parole imposed pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59) if released on parole at that time.  The determination of whether the [inmate] incarcerated person shall be released on the new parole eligibility date shall be made pursuant to the procedure set forth in section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55) and this section. For the purposes of this subsection, failed to cooperate in his or her own rehabilitation shall include, in the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person who suffers from mental illness as defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.2) that does not require institutionalization, that the [inmate] incarcerated person failed to fully participate in or cooperate with all prescribed treatment offered during incarceration. (cf: P.L.2011, c.67, s.1) 53.  Section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59) is amended to read as follows: 15.  a. Each adult parolee shall at all times remain in the legal custody of the Commissioner of Corrections and under the supervision of the State Parole Board, except that the Commissioner of Corrections, after providing notice to the Attorney General, may consent to the supervision of a parolee by the federal government pursuant to the Witness Security Reform Act, Pub.L.98-473 (18 U.S.C. s.3521 et seq.).  An adult parolee, except those under the Witness Security Reform Act, shall remain under the supervision of the State Parole Board and in the legal custody of the Department of Corrections in accordance with the policies and rules of the board. b. (1) (a) Each parolee shall agree, as evidenced by his signature to abide by specific conditions of parole established by the appropriate board panel which shall be enumerated in writing in a certificate of parole and shall be given to the parolee upon release. Such conditions shall include, among other things, a requirement that the parolee conduct himself in society in compliance with all laws and refrain from committing any crime, a requirement that the parolee will not own or possess any firearm as defined in subsection f. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 or any other weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, a requirement that the parolee refrain from the unlawful use, or the possession or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance, controlled substance analog or imitation controlled dangerous substance as defined in N.J.S.2C:35-2 and N.J.S.2C:35-11, other than possession of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10, and distribution of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (12) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5, a requirement that the parolee obtain permission from his parole officer for any change in his residence, and a requirement that the parolee report at reasonable intervals to an assigned parole officer.  In addition, based on prior history of the parolee or information provided by a victim or a member of the family of a murder victim, the member or board panel certifying parole release pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55) may impose any other specific conditions of parole deemed reasonable in order to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of criminal or delinquent behavior, including a requirement that the parolee comply with the Internet access conditions set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  Such special conditions may include, among other things, a requirement that the parolee make full or partial restitution, the amount of which restitution shall be set by the sentencing court upon request of the board.  In addition, the member or board panel certifying parole release may, giving due regard to a victim's request, impose a special condition that the parolee have no contact with the victim, which special condition may include, but need not be limited to, restraining the parolee from entering the victims residence, place of employment, business or school, and from harassing or stalking the victim or victims relatives in any way.  Further, the member, board panel or board certifying parole release may impose a special condition that the person shall not own or possess an animal for an unlawful purpose or to interfere in the performance of duties by a parole officer. (b)   The member or board panel certifying parole release shall not impose on any parolee any condition that would prohibit or restrict manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing, or possessing or having under control with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (12) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5, or possession of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10. (2)   In addition, the member or board panel certifying parole release may impose on any person who has been convicted for the commission of a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2), and who is required to register as provided in subsections c. and d. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2), or who has been convicted for a violation of N.J.S.2C:34-3 any of the following Internet access conditions: (a)   Prohibit the person from accessing or using a computer or any other device with Internet capability without the prior written approval of the court, except the person may use a computer or any other device with Internet capability in connection with that persons employment or search for employment with the prior approval of the persons parole officer; (b)   Require the person to submit to periodic unannounced examinations of the persons computer or any other device with Internet capability by a parole officer, law enforcement officer or assigned computer or information technology specialist, including the retrieval and copying of all data from the computer or device and any internal or external peripherals and removal of such information, equipment or device to conduct a more thorough inspection; (c)   Require the person to submit to the installation on the persons computer or device with Internet capability, at the persons expense, one or more hardware or software systems to monitor the Internet use; and (d)   Require the person to submit to any other appropriate restrictions concerning the persons use or access of a computer or any other device with Internet capability. c.     The appropriate board panel may in writing relieve a parolee of any parole conditions, and may permit a parolee to reside outside the State pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision (N.J.S.2A:168-14 et seq.) and, with the consent of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections after providing notice to the Attorney General, the federal Witness Security Reform Act, if satisfied that the change will not result in a substantial likelihood that the parolee will commit an offense which would be a crime under the laws of this State.  The appropriate board panel may revoke permission, except in the case of a parolee under the Witness Security Reform Act, or reinstate relieved parole conditions for any period of time during which a parolee is under its jurisdiction. d.    The appropriate board panel may parole an [inmate] incarcerated person to any residential facility funded in whole or in part by the State if the [inmate] incarcerated person would not otherwise be released pursuant to section 9 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.53) without such placement.  But if the residential facility provides treatment for mental illness or mental retardation, the board panel only may parole the [inmate] incarcerated person to the facility pursuant to the laws and admissions policies that otherwise govern the admission of persons to that facility, and the facility shall have the authority to discharge the [inmate] incarcerated person according to the laws and policies that otherwise govern the discharge of persons from the facility, on 10 days prior notice to the board panel.  The board panel shall acknowledge receipt of this notice in writing prior to the discharge.  Upon receipt of the notice the board panel shall resume jurisdiction over the [inmate] incarcerated person. e.     Parole officers shall provide assistance to the parolee in obtaining employment, education, or vocational training or in meeting other obligations to assure the parolees compliance with meeting legal requirements related to sex offender notification, address changes and participation in rehabilitation programs as directed by the assigned parole officer. f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) g.    If the board has granted parole to any [inmate] incarcerated person from a State correctional facility and the court has imposed a fine on the [inmate] incarcerated person, the appropriate board panel shall release the [inmate] incarcerated person on condition that the parolee make specified fine payments to the State Parole Board.  For violation of these conditions, or for violation of a special condition requiring restitution, parole may be revoked only for refusal or failure to make a good faith effort to make the payment. h.    Upon collection of the fine the Department of Corrections shall forward it to the State Treasury. (cf: P.L.2021, c.19, s.13) 54.  Section 1 of P.L.2020, c.111 (C.30:4-123.100) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a. In addition to credits awarded pursuant to R.S.30:4-92; section 3 of P.L.2009, c.330 (C.30:4-92a); and R.S.30:4-140, whenever a public health emergency, pursuant to the Emergency Health Powers Act, P.L.2005, c.222 (C.26:13-1 et seq.), has been declared by the Governor and is in effect, the commissioner also shall award [inmates] incarcerated persons public health emergency credits in accordance with this section if the public health emergency: (1)   arises as a result of a communicable or infectious disease;

(2) Average annual payroll means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher, except that any year or years throughout which an employer has had no annual payroll because of military service shall be deleted from the reckoning; the average annual payroll in such case is to be determined on the basis of the prior three or five calendar years in each of which the employer had an annual payroll in the operation of his business, if the employer resumes his business within 12 months after separation, discharge or release from such service, under conditions other than dishonorable, and makes application to have his average annual payroll determined on the basis of such deletion within 12 months after he resumes his business; provided, however, that average annual payroll solely for the purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-7 means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer on which he paid contributions to the State disability benefits fund for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher; provided further that only those wages be included on which employer contributions have been paid on or before January 31 (or the next succeeding day if such January 31 is a Saturday or Sunday) immediately preceding the beginning of the 12-month period for which the employers contribution rate is computed. (b) Benefits means the money payments payable to an individual, as provided in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), with respect to his unemployment. (c) (1) Base year with respect to benefit years commencing on or after July 1, 1986, shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding an individuals benefit year. With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after July 1, 1995, if an individual does not have sufficient qualifying weeks or wages in his base year to qualify for benefits, the individual shall have the option of designating that his base year shall be the alternative base year, which means the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individuals benefit year; except that, with respect to a benefit year commencing on or after October 1, 1995, if the individual also does not have sufficient qualifying weeks or wages in the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding his benefit year to qualify for benefits, alternative base year means the last three completed calendar quarters immediately preceding his benefit year and, of the calendar quarter in which the benefit year commences, the portion of the quarter which occurs before the commencing of the benefit year. The division shall inform the individual of his options under this section as amended by P.L.1995, c.234.  If information regarding weeks and wages for the calendar quarter or quarters immediately preceding the benefit year is not available to the division from the regular quarterly reports of wage information and the division is not able to obtain the information using other means pursuant to State or federal law, the division may base the determination of eligibility for benefits on the affidavit of an individual with respect to weeks and wages for that calendar quarter.  The individual shall furnish payroll documentation, if available, in support of the affidavit.  A determination of benefits based on an alternative base year shall be adjusted when the quarterly report of wage information from the employer is received if that information causes a change in the determination. (2) With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who immediately preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable under the provisions of the Temporary Disability Benefits Law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et seq.), base year shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individuals period of disability, if the employment held by the individual immediately preceding the period of disability is no longer available at the conclusion of that period and the individual files a valid claim for unemployment benefits after the conclusion of that period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, period of disability means the period defined as a period of disability by section 3 of the Temporary Disability Benefits Law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27).  An individual who files a claim under the provisions of this paragraph (2) shall not be regarded as having left work voluntarily for the purposes of subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-5. (3) With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who immediately preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable under the provisions of the workers compensation law (chapter 15 of Title 34 of the Revised Statutes), base year shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individuals period of disability, if the period of disability was not longer than two years, if the employment held by the individual immediately preceding the period of disability is no longer available at the conclusion of that period and if the individual files a valid claim for unemployment benefits after the conclusion of that period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, period of disability means the period from the time at which the individual becomes unable to work because of the compensable disability until the time that the individual becomes able to resume work and continue work on a permanent basis.  An individual who files a claim under the provisions of this paragraph (3) shall not be regarded as having left work voluntarily for the purposes of subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-5. (d) Benefit year with respect to any individual means the 364 consecutive calendar days beginning with the day on, or as of, which he first files a valid claim for benefits, and thereafter beginning with the day on, or as of, which the individual next files a valid claim for benefits after the termination of his last preceding benefit year.  Any claim for benefits made in accordance with subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-6 shall be deemed to be a valid claim for the purpose of this subsection if (1) he is unemployed for the week in which, or as of which, he files a claim for benefits; and (2) he has fulfilled the conditions imposed by subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-4. (e) (1) Division means the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and any transaction or exercise of authority by the director of the division thereunder, or under this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), shall be deemed to be performed by the division.

(3) The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as requiring or permitting a waiver of the recovery of any overpayments of unemployment benefits if the waiver is prohibited by any federal law, regulation or administrative directive.  A recovery shall not be waived unless the division determines that the claimant is without fault and the repayment would be contrary to equity and good conscience in the case of the recovery of an overpayment of benefit under any of the following programs authorized by the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Pub.L.116-136: Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), Mixed Earners Unemployment Compensation (MEUC), Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), or the first week of regular Unemployment Compensation that is reimbursed in accordance with Section 2105 of the CARES Act.

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude the program of intensive supervision from imposing more restrictive standards for admission. b.    Unless the [inmate] incarcerated person is within nine months of parole eligibility and has served at least six months of the sentence, no custodial sentence of an [inmate] incarcerated person serving a sentence for conviction of any crime of the second degree shall be changed to permit entry into any program of intensive supervision established pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey, if, within 20 days of receipt of notice of the [inmate's] incarcerated persons application, the county prosecutor or Attorney General objects in writing. c.     If an [inmates] incarcerated persons application for a change of custodial sentence to permit entry into any program of intensive supervision established pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey is granted over the objection of the county prosecutor or the Attorney General, the order shall not become final for 20 days or until reconsideration by the Intensive Supervision Resentencing Panel in order to permit the county prosecutor or the Attorney General to appear personally or in writing, with notice to defense counsel, to request reconsideration of the application approval. d.    A victim of the offense for which the [inmate] incarcerated person was sentenced shall have the right to make a written statement or to appear at a proceeding regarding the application for a change of custodial sentence imposed pursuant to Chapter 43, 44 or 45 of Title 2C for entry into any program of intensive supervision established pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey.

There shall be no overall outer limit on the cumulation of consecutive sentences for multiple offenses. b.    Sentences of imprisonment imposed at different times. When a defendant who has previously been sentenced to imprisonment is subsequently sentenced to another term for an offense committed prior to the former sentence, other than an offense committed while in custody: (1)   The multiple sentences imposed shall so far as possible conform to subsection a. of this section; and (2)   Whether the court determines that the terms shall run concurrently or consecutively, the defendant shall be credited with time served in imprisonment on the prior sentence in determining the permissible aggregate length of the term or terms remaining to be served; and (3)   When a new sentence is imposed on a prisoner who is on parole, the balance of the parole term on the former sentence shall not be deemed to run during the period of the new imprisonment unless the court determines otherwise at the time of sentencing. c.     Sentence of imprisonment for offense committed while on parole. When a defendant is sentenced to imprisonment for an offense committed while on parole in this State, such term of imprisonment and any period of reimprisonment that the parole board may require the defendant to serve upon the revocation of his parole shall run consecutively unless the court orders these sentences to run concurrently. d.    Multiple sentences of imprisonment in other cases. Except as otherwise provided in this section, multiple terms of imprisonment shall run concurrently or consecutively as the court determines when the second or subsequent sentence is imposed. e.     Calculation of concurrent and consecutive terms of imprisonment. (1)   When terms of imprisonment run concurrently, the shorter terms merge in and are satisfied by discharge of the longest term.

The decision to place and retain an [inmate] incarcerated person in medical isolation due to a mental health emergency shall be made by a clinician based on a personal examination.  In any case of isolation under this paragraph, a clinical review shall be conducted at least every eight hours and as clinically indicated.  An [inmate] incarcerated person in medical isolation pursuant to this paragraph may be placed in a mental health unit as designated by the commissioner.  In the case of a county correctional facility, a decision to place an [inmate] incarcerated person in medical isolation shall be made by a member of the medical staff and be based on a personal examination; clinical reviews shall be conducted within 72 hours and then as clinically indicated. (4)   The facility administrator determines that an [inmate] incarcerated person should be placed in protective custody as follows: (a)   The facility shall keep a written record of a request by an [inmate] incarcerated person to be placed in voluntary protective custody.  The [inmate] incarcerated person may be placed in voluntary protective custody only with informed, voluntary consent and when there is reasonable cause to believe that confinement is necessary to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm.  When an [inmate] incarcerated person makes an informed voluntary request for protective custody, the correctional facility shall bear the burden of establishing a basis for refusing the request. (b)   The [inmate] incarcerated person may be placed in involuntary protective custody only when there is clear and convincing evidence that confinement is necessary to prevent reasonably foreseeable harm and that a less restrictive intervention would not be sufficient to prevent the harm. (c)   An [inmate] incarcerated person placed in protective custody shall receive similar opportunities for activities, movement, and social interaction, consistent with their safety and the safety of others, as are [inmates] incarcerated persons in the general population of the facility. (d)   An [inmate] incarcerated person subject to removal from protective custody shall be provided with a timely, fair, and meaningful opportunity to contest the removal. (e)   An [inmate] incarcerated person who may be placed or currently is in voluntary protective custody may opt out of that status by providing informed, voluntary, written refusal of that status. (f)   The facility administrator shall place an [inmate] incarcerated person in a less restrictive intervention, including transfer to the general population of another institution or to a special-purpose housing unit for [inmates] incarcerated persons who face similar threats, before placing the [inmate] incarcerated person in isolated confinement for protection unless the [inmate] incarcerated person poses a security risk so great that transferring the [inmate] incarcerated person would be insufficient to ensure the [inmates] incarcerated persons safety.

By the same method, any [inmate] incarcerated person of a correctional institution maintained by the State, on the initiative of the commissioner, may be transferred, with the consent of the board of chosen freeholders, to an appropriate correctional institution in any one of the several counties. In the event it is determined by the Commissioner of Corrections that a county jail, workhouse or penitentiary is not suitable or adequate to properly secure any [inmate] incarcerated person under sentence or charged with any criminal offense, he may transfer the [inmate] incarcerated person to any existing correctional institution maintained by the State, including the State Prison.  The Commissioner of Corrections shall be empowered to determine a specific State correctional institution, including the State Prison, for the proper and secure incarceration of the [inmate] incarcerated person. Any person so transferred may be retransferred to his place of original confinement or may be transferred to any existing jail, workhouse or penitentiary located in any one of the several counties.  The cost of such transfer and the expense of maintaining the [inmate] incarcerated person in any State institution or an institution located in a county other than the county from which the [inmate] incarcerated person was originally committed and confined shall be borne by the State.

Consistent with the provisions of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice (N.J.S.2C:11-3, 2C:14-6, 2C:43-6, 2C:43-7), commutation and work credits shall not in any way reduce any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term and such credits accrued shall only be awarded subsequent to the expiration of the term. b.    Each adult [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a term of life imprisonment shall become primarily eligible for parole after having served any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term, or 25 years where no mandatory minimum term has been imposed less commutation time for good behavior and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments.  If an [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a specific term or terms of years is eligible for parole on a date later than the date upon which he would be eligible if a life sentence had been imposed, then in such case the [inmate] incarcerated person shall be eligible for parole after having served 25 years, less commutation time for good behavior and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments.  Consistent with the provisions of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice (N.J.S.2C:11-3, 2C:14-6, 2C:43-6, 2C:43-7), commutation and work credits shall not in any way reduce any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term and such credits accrued shall only be awarded subsequent to the expiration of the term. c.     Each adult [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a specific term of years pursuant to the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act, P.L.1970, c.226 (C.24:21-1 et al.) shall become primarily eligible for parole after having served one-third of the sentence imposed less commutation time for good behavior and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments. d.    Each adult [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to an indeterminate term of years as a young adult offender pursuant to N.J.S.2C:43-5 shall become primarily eligible for parole consideration pursuant to a schedule of primary eligibility dates developed by the board, less adjustment for program participation.  In no case shall the board schedule require that the primary parole eligibility date for a young adult offender be greater than the primary parole eligibility date required pursuant to this section for the presumptive term for the crime authorized pursuant to subsection f. of N.J.S.2C:44-1. e.     Each adult [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced for an offense specified in N.J.S.2C:47-1 shall become primarily eligible for parole as follows: (1)   If the court finds that the offenders conduct was not characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior or finds that the offender is not amenable to sex offender treatment, or if after sentencing the Department of Corrections in its most recent examination determines that the offender is not amenable to sex offender treatment, the offender shall become primarily eligible for parole after having served any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term or one-third of the sentence imposed where no mandatory minimum term has been imposed.  Neither such term shall be reduced by commutation time for good behavior pursuant to R.S.30:4-140 or credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments pursuant to R.S.30:4-92. (2)   Young adult offenders shall be eligible for parole pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.2C:47-5, except no offender shall become primarily eligible for parole prior to the expiration of any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term. f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) g.    Each adult [inmate of] incarcerated person in a county jail, workhouse, or penitentiary shall become primarily eligible for parole upon service of 60 days of his aggregate sentence or as provided for in subsection a. of this section, whichever is greater.  Whenever any such [inmates] incarcerated persons parole eligibility is within six months of the date of such sentence, the judge shall state such eligibility on the record which shall satisfy all public and [inmate] incarcerated person notice requirements.  The chief executive officer of the institution in which county [inmates] incarcerated persons are held shall generate all reports pursuant to subsection d. of section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54).  The parole board shall have the authority to promulgate time periods applicable to the parole processing of [inmates of] incarcerated persons in county penal institutions, except that no [inmate] incarcerated person may be released prior to the primary eligibility date established by this subsection, unless consented to by the sentencing judge.  No [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a specific term of years at the State Prison or the correctional institution for women shall become primarily eligible for parole until service of a full nine months of his aggregate sentence. h.    When an [inmate] incarcerated person is sentenced to more than one term of imprisonment, the primary parole eligibility terms calculated pursuant to this section shall be aggregated by the board for the purpose of determining the primary parole eligibility date.  The board shall promulgate rules and regulations to govern aggregation under this subsection. i.     The primary eligibility date shall be computed by a designated representative of the board and made known to the [inmate] incarcerated person in writing not later than 90 days following the commencement of the sentence.  In the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a county penal institution such notice shall be made pursuant to subsection g. of this section.  Each [inmate] incarcerated person shall be given the opportunity to acknowledge in writing the receipt of such computation.  Failure or refusal by the [inmate] incarcerated person to acknowledge the receipt of such computation shall be recorded by the board but shall not constitute a violation of this subsection. j.     Except as provided in this subsection, each [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced pursuant to N.J.S.2A:113-4 for a term of life imprisonment, N.J.S.2A:164-17 for a fixed minimum and maximum term or subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:1-1 shall not be primarily eligible for parole on a date computed pursuant to this section, but shall be primarily eligible on a date computed pursuant to P.L.1948, c.84 (C.30:4-123.1 et seq.), which is continued in effect for this purpose.  [Inmates] Incarcerated persons classified as second, third or fourth offenders pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1948, c.84 (C.30:4-123.12) shall become primarily eligible for parole after serving one-third, one-half, or two-thirds of the maximum sentence imposed, respectively, less in each instance commutation time for good behavior and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments; provided, however, that if the prosecuting attorney or the sentencing court advises the board that the punitive aspects of the sentence imposed on such [inmates] incarcerated persons will not have been fulfilled by the time of parole eligibility calculated pursuant to this subsection, then the [inmate] incarcerated person shall not become primarily eligible for parole until serving an additional period which shall be one-half of the difference between the primary parole eligibility date calculated pursuant to this subsection and the parole eligibility date calculated pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1948, c.84 (C.30:4-123.12).  If the prosecuting attorney or the sentencing court advises the board that the punitive aspects of the sentence have not been fulfilled, such advice need not be supported by reasons and will be deemed conclusive and final.  Any such decision shall not be subject to judicial review except to the extent mandated by the New Jersey and United States Constitutions.  The board shall, reasonably prior to considering any such case, advise the prosecuting attorney and the sentencing court of all information relevant to such [inmates] incarcerated persons  parole eligibility. k.    Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, a person sentenced to imprisonment pursuant to paragraph (2), (3), or (4) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:11-3 shall not be eligible for parole. l.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections a. through j. of this section, the appropriate board panel, as provided in section 1 of P.L.1997, c.214 (C.30:4-123.51c), may release an [inmate] incarcerated person serving a sentence of imprisonment on medical parole at any time. (cf: P.L.2019, c.363, s.10) 47.  Section 1 of P.L.2020, c.106 (C.30:4-123.51e) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a. Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45 et seq.) to the contrary, the court may release an [inmate] incarcerated person who qualifies under this section for compassionate release at any time during the term of incarceration.  An [inmate] incarcerated person granted compassionate release pursuant to this section shall be subject to custody, supervision, and conditions as provided in section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59) and shall be subject to sanctions for a violation of a condition of compassionate release as if on parole as provided in sections 16 through 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through 30:4-123.65). b.    The Commissioner of Corrections shall establish and maintain a process by which an [inmate] incarcerated person may obtain a medical diagnosis to determine whether the [inmate] incarcerated person is eligible for compassionate release.  The medical diagnosis shall be made by two licensed physicians designated by the commissioner.  The diagnosis shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   a description of the terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or permanent physical incapacity; (2)   a prognosis concerning the likelihood of recovery from the terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or permanent physical incapacity; (3)   a description of the [inmates] incarcerated persons physical incapacity, if appropriate; and (4)   a description of the type of ongoing treatment that would be required if the [inmate] incarcerated person is granted compassionate release. c.     A medical diagnosis to determine whether an [inmate] incarcerated person is eligible for compassionate release under this section may be initiated by the administrator, superintendent, or a staff member of a correctional facility or, upon request, submitted to the Commissioner of Corrections by the [inmate] incarcerated person, a member of the [inmates] incarcerated persons family, or the [inmates] incarcerated persons attorney.  The request shall be submitted in a manner and form prescribed by the Commissioner of Corrections. d. (1) In the event that a medical diagnosis determines that an [inmate] incarcerated person is suffering from a grave medical condition as defined in subsection l. of this section, the Department of Corrections shall promptly notify the [inmates] incarcerated persons attorney or, if the [inmate] incarcerated person does not have an attorney, the Public Defender, to initiate the process of petitioning for compassionate release.  The petition shall not be filed until a subsequent medical diagnosis determines that the [inmate] incarcerated person is suffering from a terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or a permanent physical incapacity as defined in subsection l. of this section and the Department of Corrections issues to the [inmate] incarcerated person a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release. (2)   In the event that a medical diagnosis determines that an [inmate] incarcerated person is suffering from a terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or permanent physical incapacity as defined in subsection l. of this section, the Department of Corrections shall promptly issue to the [inmate] incarcerated person a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release and provide a copy of the certificate to the [inmates] incarcerate persons attorney or, if the [inmate] incarcerated person does not have an attorney, the Public Defender.  An [inmate] incarcerated person who receives a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release may petition the court for compassionate release. (3)   In the event of a medical diagnosis that an [inmate] incarcerated person is suffering from a grave medical condition or upon issuance of a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release, an [inmate] incarcerated person may request representation from the Office of the Public Defender for the purpose of filing a petition for compassionate release. e.     A petition for compassionate release shall be filed with the Superior Court. (1)   The petitioner shall serve a copy of the petition in accordance with the Rules of Court on the county prosecutor who prosecuted the matter or, if the matter was prosecuted by the Attorney General, the Attorney General. (2)   The county prosecutor or the Attorney General, as the case may be, shall provide notice of the petition to any victim or member of the family of a victim entitled to notice relating to a parole or the consideration of a parole under the provisions of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45 et seq.), and shall notify the victim or family member of the opportunity to present a statement at the hearing on the petition or to testify to the court concerning any harm suffered by the victim or family member at the time of the hearing. (3)   Upon receipt of notice of the petition, the victim or member of the family of the victim, as the case may be, may submit any comments to the court within 15 days following receipt of notice of the petition, including but not limited to advising the court of an intent to testify at the hearing. (4)   The information contained in the petition and the contents of any comments submitted by a recipient in response thereto shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to any person who is not authorized to receive or review the information or comments. (5)   If a recipient of a notice of the petition does not submit comments or advise the court of an intent to testify at the hearing within the 15-day period following receipt of the notice of the petition, the court may presume that the recipient does not wish to submit comments and proceed with its consideration of the petition. (6)   The prosecutor shall have 15 days to respond to the petition, which period may be extended to 30 days for good cause shown. (7)   If the court receives from the prosecutor a response objecting to the petition or is notified that a victim or a family member intends to testify to the court at the hearing, the court shall hold a hearing on the petition on an expedited basis in accordance with the Rules of Court and procedures established by the Administrative Director of the Courts.  If the court does not, within the time frames established under this subsection, receive a response from the prosecutor objecting to the petition and is not notified of an intent for a victim or family member to testify, the court may make a determination on the petition without holding a hearing.  Notice given under the provisions of this subsection shall be in lieu of any other notice of parole consideration required under P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45 et seq.). Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair the right of any party to be heard pursuant to P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45 et seq.). f. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of section 9 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.53), the court may order the compassionate release of an [inmate] incarcerated person who has been issued a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the [inmate] incarcerated person is so debilitated or incapacitated by the terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or permanent physical incapacity as to be permanently physically incapable of committing a crime if released and, in the case of a permanent physical incapacity, the conditions established in accordance with subsection h. of this section under which the [inmate] incarcerated person would be released would not pose a threat to public safety. (2)   No petition for compassionate release may be submitted to the court unless it is accompanied by a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section.  The court may summarily dismiss a petition for compassionate release if the petition is submitted without a Certificate of Eligibility for Compassionate Release. (3)   The court shall provide to the [inmate] incarcerated person and the county prosecutor or Attorney General, as the case may be, written notice of its decision setting forth the reasons for granting or denying compassionate release, and the county prosecutor or Attorney General, as the case may be, shall notify any victim or member of a victims family who received notification pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection e. of this section of the outcome of the court's decision. g.    An order by the court granting a petition for compassionate release shall not become final for 10 days in order to permit the prosecution to appeal the court's order. h.    Whenever an [inmate] incarcerated person is granted compassionate release pursuant to this section, the court shall require, as a condition precedent to release, the State Parole Board to ensure that the [inmates] incarcerated persons release plan includes: (1)   identification of a community sponsor; (2)   verification of the availability of appropriate medical services sufficient to meet the treatment requirements identified pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection b. of this section; and (3)   verification of appropriate housing which may include, but need not be limited to, a hospital, hospice, nursing home facility, or other housing accommodation suitable to the [inmates] incarcerated persons medical condition, disease or syndrome, or permanent physical incapacity. The Commissioner of Corrections shall ensure that any [inmate] incarcerated person who petitions for compassionate release is provided an opportunity to apply, and is provided necessary assistance to complete the application, for medical assistance benefits under the Medicaid program established pursuant to P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.) prior to any determination of ineligibility by the court as a result of the inability to verify the availability of appropriate medical services, as required pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. i.     In addition to any conditions imposed pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59), as a condition of compassionate release, the State Parole Board may require an [inmate] incarcerated person to submit to periodic medical diagnoses by a licensed physician. j.     If, after review of a medical diagnosis required under the provisions of subsection i. of this section, the State Parole Board determines that a parolee granted compassionate release is no longer so debilitated or incapacitated by a terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or by a permanent physical incapacity as to be physically incapable of committing a crime or, in the case of a permanent physical incapacity, the parolee poses a threat to public safety, the State Parole Board shall so notify the prosecutor, who may initiate proceedings to return the [inmate] incarcerated person to confinement in an appropriate facility designated by the Commissioner of Corrections. The prosecutor shall provide notice of the request to return the parolee to confinement to the parolee and the parolees attorney or, if the parolee does not have an attorney, the Public Defender.  The parolee shall have 15 days after receipt of the notice to object to the return to confinement, which period may be extended to 30 days for good cause shown.  If the Superior Court receives from the parolee an objection to the request to return the parolee to confinement, the court shall hold a hearing on an expedited basis in accordance with the Rules of Court and procedures established by the Administrative Director of the Courts to determine whether the parolee should be returned to confinement pursuant to this subsection.  If the court does not receive a timely objection to the return to confinement, the court may make a determination on the request without holding a hearing.  The parolee shall be returned to confinement if the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the parolee poses a threat to public safety because the parolee is no longer debilitated or incapacitated by a terminal condition, disease or syndrome, or by a permanent physical incapacity.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the board, an appropriate board panel, or parole officer of the State Parole Board to address a violation of a condition of parole pursuant to sections 16 through 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through 30:4-123.65). k.    The denial of a petition for compassionate release or the return of a parolee to confinement under the provisions of subsection j. of this section shall not preclude an [inmate] incarcerated person from being considered for parole, if eligible, pursuant to subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.51). l.     For purposes of this section: Grave medical condition means a prognosis by the licensed physicians designated by the Commissioner of Corrections pursuant to subsection b. of this section that an [inmate] incarcerated person has more than six months but not more than 12 months to live or has a medical condition that did not exist at the time of sentencing and for at least three months has rendered the [inmate] incarcerated person unable to perform activities of basic daily living, resulting in the [inmate] incarcerated person requiring 24-hour care. Terminal condition, disease or syndrome means a prognosis by the licensed physicians designated by the Commissioner of Corrections pursuant to subsection b. of this section that an [inmate] incarcerated person has six months or less to live. Permanent physical incapacity means a prognosis by the licensed physicians designated by the Commissioner of Corrections pursuant to subsection b. of this section that an [inmate] incarcerated person has a medical condition that renders the [inmate] incarcerated person permanently unable to perform activities of basic daily living, results in the [inmate] incarcerated person requiring 24-hour care, and did not exist at the time of sentencing. (cf: P.L.2020, c.106, s.1) 48.  Section 8 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.52) is amended to read as follows: 8.  a. If the appropriate board panel determines that an adult [inmate] incarcerated person has seriously or persistently violated specifically defined institutional rules or has engaged in conduct indictable in nature while incarcerated, the [inmates] incarcerated persons parole eligibility date may be increased pursuant to a schedule developed by the board.  In developing such schedule, particular emphasis shall be placed on the severity of the [inmates] incarcerated persons conduct.  The board shall deduct from the scheduled penalty any loss of commutation time imposed by the Department of Corrections pursuant to R.S.30:4-140. b.    If the appropriate board panel determines that an adult [inmate] incarcerated person has made exceptional progress, as evidenced by documented participation and progress in institutional or community educational, training or other programs, the [inmates] incarcerated persons parole eligibility date may be decreased, except that no parole eligibility date shall be set below the primary parole eligibility date without the consent of the sentencing court, which need not conduct a hearing and in no case shall a parole eligibility date be set below any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term, including any parole eligibility date set pursuant to section 23 of this act. c.     The appropriate board panel shall annually monitor the progress of each adult [inmate] incarcerated person and provide the [inmate] incarcerated person with a written statement of any changes in his parole eligibility. d.    At any time while an [inmate] incarcerated person is committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections, the appropriate board panel or the Parole Board may require, as often as it deems necessary, that [inmate] incarcerated person to undergo an in-depth preparole psychological evaluation conducted by a psychologist. e.     Prior to the parole eligibility date of each adult [inmate] incarcerated person, an objective risk assessment shall be performed by board staff or by some other appropriate agent of the State.  The risk assessment, which shall be in a form prescribed by the board pursuant to rule and regulation, shall consist of both static and dynamic factors which may assist the board panel in determining whether the [inmate] incarcerated person shall be certified for parole and, if paroled, the level of supervision the parolee may require.  In addition to the information otherwise gathered for and incorporated in the pre-parole report, the assessment shall include evaluations of the [inmates] incarcerated persons ability to function independently, the [inmates] incarcerated persons educational and employment background, the [inmates] incarcerated persons family and marital history, and such other information and factors as the board may deem appropriate and necessary. (cf: P.L.2001, c.79, s.18) 49.  Section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54) is amended to read as follows: 10.  a. At least 120 days but not more than 180 days prior to the parole eligibility date of each adult [inmate] incarcerated person, a report concerning the [inmate] incarcerated person shall be filed with the appropriate board panel, by the staff members designated by the superintendent or other chief executive officer of the institution in which the [inmate] incarcerated person is held. b. (1) The report filed pursuant to subsection a. shall contain preincarceration records of the [inmate] incarcerated person, including any history of civil commitment, any disposition which arose out of any charges suspended pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-6 including records of the disposition of those charges and any acquittals by reason of insanity pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-1, state the conduct of the [inmate] incarcerated person during the current period of confinement, include a complete report on the [inmates] incarcerated persons social and physical condition, include an investigation by the Division of Parole of the [inmates] incarcerated persons parole plans, and present information bearing upon the likelihood that the [inmate] incarcerated person will commit a crime under the laws of this State if released on parole.  The report shall also include a complete psychological evaluation of the [inmate] incarcerated person in any case in which the [inmate] incarcerated person was convicted of a first or second degree crime involving violence and: (a)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has a prior acquittal by reason of insanity pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-1 or had charges suspended pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-6; or (b)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has a prior conviction for murder pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-3, aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-2, kidnapping pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-1, endangering the welfare of a child which would constitute a crime of the second degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-4, or stalking which would constitute a crime of the third degree pursuant to P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10); or (c)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has a prior diagnosis of psychosis. The [inmate] incarcerated person shall disclose any information concerning any history of civil commitment. The preincarceration records of the [inmate] incarcerated person contained in the report shall include any psychological reports prepared in connection with any court proceedings. (2)   At the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall notify any victim injured as a result of a crime of the first or second degree or the nearest relative of a murder victim of the opportunity to present a written or videotaped statement for the parole report to be considered at the parole hearing or to testify to the parole board concerning his harm at the time of the parole hearing.  Each victim or relative shall be responsible for notifying the board of his intention to submit such a statement and to provide an appropriate mailing address. The report may include a written or videotaped statement concerning the continuing nature and extent of any physical harm or psychological or emotional harm or trauma suffered by the victim, the extent of any loss of earnings or ability to work suffered by the victim and the continuing effect of the crime upon the victims family.  At the time public notice is given that an [inmate] incarcerated person is being considered for parole pursuant to this section, the board shall also notify any victim or nearest relative who has previously contacted the board of the availability to provide a written or videotaped statement for inclusion in the parole report or to present testimony at the parole hearing. The board shall notify the victim or relative at the victims or relatives last known mailing address. (3)   If the [inmate] incarcerated person meets the requirements for administrative parole release pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d) the report shall indicate this eligibility. c.     A copy of the report filed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, excepting those documents which have been classified as confidential pursuant to rules and regulations of the board or the Department of Corrections, shall be served on the [inmate] incarcerated person at the time it is filed with the board panel.  The [inmate] incarcerated person may file with the board panel a written statement regarding the report, but shall do so within 105 days prior to the primary parole eligibility date. d.    Upon receipt of the public notice pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45), a county prosecutor, a public defender, or a private attorney of record may request from the parole board a copy of the report on any adult [inmate] incarcerated person prepared pursuant to subsection a. of this section, which shall be expeditiously forwarded to the county prosecutor by the parole board by mail, courier, or other means of delivery.  Upon receipt of the report, the prosecutor has 10 working days to review the report and notify the parole board of the prosecutor's comments, if any, or notify the parole board of the prosecutors intent to provide comments.  If the county prosecutor does not provide comments or notify the parole board of the prosecutors intent to provide comments within the 10 working days, the parole board may presume that the prosecutor does not wish to provide comments and may proceed with the parole consideration.  Any comments provided by a county prosecutor shall be delivered to the parole board by the same method by which the county prosecutor received the report.  The confidentiality of the contents in a report which are classified as confidential shall be maintained and shall not be disclosed to any person who is not authorized to receive or review a copy of the report containing the confidential information. e.     Any provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, the board shall by rule or regulation modify the scope of the required reports and time periods for rendering such reports with reference to county penal institutions. f.     Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the board may modify the time periods for submitting the reports required pursuant to this section in processing an [inmate] incarcerated person whose parole eligibility date is accelerated pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55). (cf: P.L.2019, c.364, s.9) 50.  Section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55) is amended to read as follows: 11.  a. Prior to the parole eligibility date of each adult [inmate] incarcerated person, a designated hearing officer shall review the reports required by section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54), and shall determine whether: (1)   the [inmate] incarcerated person is eligible for administrative parole release pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d).  If an [inmate] incarcerated person is eligible for administrative parole release, the hearing officer shall at least 60 days prior to the [inmates] incarcerated persons parole eligibility date recommend in writing to the assigned member of the board panel that administrative parole release be granted pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d); or (2)   there is a basis for denial of parole in the preparole report, any risk assessment prepared in accordance with the provisions of subsection e. of section 8 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.52), or the [inmates] incarcerated persons statement, or an indication, reduced to writing, that additional information providing a basis for denial of parole would be developed or produced at a hearing.  If the hearing officer determines that there is no basis in the preparole report, the risk assessment, or the [inmates] incarcerated persons statement for denial of parole and that there is no additional relevant information to be developed or produced at a hearing, he shall at least 60 days prior to the [inmates] incarcerated persons parole eligibility date recommend in writing to the assigned member of the board panel that parole release be granted. b.    If the assigned member of the board panel or in the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a county penal institution, the assigned member concurs in the hearing officers recommendation, he shall certify parole release pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59) as soon as practicable after the eligibility date and so notify the [inmate] incarcerated person and the board.  In the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person recommended for administrative parole release by the hearing officer pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d), the assigned member shall review the reports required by section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54) to confirm eligibility and if the [inmate] incarcerated person is eligible, shall certify parole release pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59) as soon as practicable after the eligibility date and notify the [inmate] incarcerated person and the board.  In the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a county penal institution the board shall certify parole release or deny parole as provided by this section, except with regard to time periods for notice and parole processing which are authorized by or otherwise adopted pursuant to subsection g. of section 7 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.51).  If the designated hearing officer does not recommend release on parole or if the assigned member does not concur in a recommendation of the designated hearing officer in favor of release, then the parole release of an [inmate] incarcerated person in a county penal institution shall be treated under the provisions of law otherwise applicable to an adult [inmate] incarcerated person.  In the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person sentenced to a county penal institution, the performance of public service for the remainder of the term of the sentence shall be a required condition of parole, where appropriate. c.     If the hearing officer or the assigned member determines that there is a basis for denial of parole, or that a hearing is otherwise necessary, the hearing officer or assigned member shall notify the appropriate board panel and the [inmate] incarcerated person in writing of his determination, and of a date for a parole consideration hearing.  The board panel shall notify the victim of the crime, if the crime for which the [inmate] incarcerated person is incarcerated was a crime of the first or second degree, or the victims nearest relative if the crime was murder, as appropriate, who was previously contacted by the board and who has indicated his intention to the board to testify at the hearing, of the opportunity to testify or submit written or videotaped statements at the hearing.  Said hearing shall be conducted by the appropriate board panel at least 30 days prior to the eligibility date.  At the hearing, which shall be informal, the board panel shall receive as evidence any relevant and reliable documents or videotaped or in person testimony, including that of the victim of the crime or the members of the family of a murder victim if the victim or a family member so desires. If a victim of a crime or the relative of a murder victim chooses not to testify personally at the hearing, the victim or relative may elect to present testimony to a senior hearing officer designated by the board panel.  The senior hearing officer shall notify the victim of the right to have this testimony videotaped.  The senior hearing officer shall prepare a report, transcript or videotape, if applicable, of the testimony for presentation to the board panel at the hearing.  All such evidence not classified as confidential pursuant to rules and regulations of the board or the Department of Corrections shall be disclosed to the [inmate] incarcerated person and the [inmate] incarcerated person shall be permitted to rebut such evidence and to present evidence on his own behalf.  The decision of the board panel shall be based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing. d.    At the conclusion of the parole consideration hearing, the board panel shall either (1) certify the parole release of the [inmate] incarcerated person pursuant to section 15 of this act as soon as practicable after the eligibility date and so notify the [inmate] incarcerated person and the board, or (2) deny parole and file with the board within 30 days of the hearing a statement setting forth the decision, the particular reasons therefor, except information classified as confidential pursuant to rules and regulations of the board or the Department of Corrections, a copy of which statement shall be served upon the [inmate] incarcerated person together with notice of his right to appeal to the board. e.     Upon request by the hearing officer or the [inmate] incarcerated person, the time limitations contained in section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54) and this section may be waived by the appropriate board panel for good cause. f.     Notwithstanding the provision of any other law to the contrary, if an [inmate] incarcerated person incarcerated for murder is recommended for parole by the assigned board member or the appropriate board panel, parole shall not be certified until a majority of the full parole board, after conducting a hearing, concurs in that recommendation. The board shall notify the victims family of that hearing and family members shall be afforded the opportunity to testify in person or to submit written or videotaped statements.  The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to an [inmate] incarcerated person who has his parole revoked and is returned to custody pursuant to the provisions of section 19 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.63). g.    Notwithstanding the provision of any other law or regulation to the contrary, the board may promulgate rules and regulations for the processing of any [inmate] incarcerated person whose parole eligibility date is accelerated.  For purposes of this section, a parole eligibility date is accelerated when an [inmate] incarcerated person becomes eligible for parole at the time of or within 120 days of an event or circumstance beyond the control of the parole board, such as sentencing, resentencing or other amendment, including the awarding of additional credit to the original sentence, restoration of authorized institutional time credits or the application of authorized institutional time credits on a future eligibility date established pursuant to subsection a. of section 12 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.56) or subsection a. of section 20 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.64).  The rules and regulations shall provide for the preparation and review of a preparole report and shall require that a parole consideration hearing be held not more than 120 days after the board has received notice that an accelerated parole eligibility date has been established. (cf: P.L.2019, c.364, s.10) 51.  Section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d) is amended to read as follows: 4.  a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of section 9 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.53), an adult [inmate] incarcerated person shall be administratively released on parole at the time of primary or subsequent parole eligibility provided that: (1)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has not been previously convicted of, adjudicated delinquent for, or is currently serving a sentence imposed for any crime enumerated in subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.2C:43-7.2); subsection c. or g. of N.J.S.2C:43-6; subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2); or section 3 of P.L.1998, c.71 (C.30:4-27.26); (2)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has not committed any prohibited acts required to be reported to the prosecutor pursuant to regulations promulgated by the commissioner during the current period of incarceration, and has not committed any serious disciplinary infraction, designated in regulations promulgated by the commissioner as a prohibited act that is considered to be the most serious and results in the most severe sanctions, within the previous two years; (3)   the [inmate] incarcerated person has completed relevant rehabilitation programs, as determined by the Department of Corrections and State Parole Board, available at the correctional facility or applied for but was unable to complete or was denied access to these programs due to circumstances beyond the [inmates] incarcerated persons control including, but not limited to, capacity limitations or exclusionary policies of these programs; and (4)   crime victims have received notification as required by law. b.    In the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person who meets the criteria set forth in this section for administrative parole release, a hearing shall not be required pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55).  An [inmate] incarcerated person released on parole pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall, during the term of parole supervision, remain in the legal custody of the Commissioner of Corrections, be supervised by the Division of Parole of the State Parole Board, and be subject to the provisions and conditions established by the appropriate board panel in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59).  If the parolee violates a condition of parole, the parolee shall be subject to the provisions of sections 16 through 19 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through C.30:4-123.63) and may have his parole revoked and be returned to custody.  If revocation and return to custody are deemed appropriate, the appropriate board panel shall revoke the parolee's release and return the parolee to custody and confinement pursuant to the provisions of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.30:4-123.51b). c.     Denials of administrative parole release shall be appealable in accordance with section 14 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.58). d.    A criminal justice program at a four-year public institution of higher education in this State shall conduct a study of all [inmates] incarcerated persons whose primary parole eligibility date was within the five years immediately preceding the implementation of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55b et al.) and the five years immediately following the implementation of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55b et al.).  The study shall include, but not be limited to, the number of [inmates] incarcerated persons who met the criteria set forth in subsection a. of this section, the number of [inmates] incarcerated persons who did not meet the criteria, and the reasons an [inmate] incarcerated person did not meet the criteria. (cf: P.L.2019, c.364, s.4) 52.  Section 12 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.56) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a. The board shall develop a schedule of future parole eligibility dates for adult [inmates] incarcerated persons denied release at their eligibility date.  In developing such schedule, particular emphasis shall be placed on the severity of the offense for which he was denied parole and on the characteristics of the offender, such as, but not limited to, the prior criminal record of the [inmate] incarcerated person and the need for continued incapacitation of the [inmate] incarcerated person. b.    If the release on the eligibility date is denied, the board panel which conducted the hearing shall refer to the schedule published pursuant to subsection a., and include in its statement denying parole notice of the date of future parole consideration.  If such date differs from the date otherwise established by the schedule, the board panel shall include particular reasons therefor.  The future parole eligibility date shall not be altered to take into account remissions of sentence for good behavior and diligent application to work and other assignments; provided however, the future parole eligibility date may be altered pursuant to section 8 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.52). c.     An [inmate] incarcerated person shall be released on parole on the new parole eligibility date unless information filed pursuant to a procedure identical to that set forth in section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54) indicates by a preponderance of the evidence that the [inmate] incarcerated person has failed to cooperate in his or her own rehabilitation or that there is a reasonable expectation that the [inmate] incarcerated person will violate conditions of parole imposed pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59) if released on parole at that time.  The determination of whether the [inmate] incarcerated person shall be released on the new parole eligibility date shall be made pursuant to the procedure set forth in section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55) and this section. For the purposes of this subsection, failed to cooperate in his or her own rehabilitation shall include, in the case of an [inmate] incarcerated person who suffers from mental illness as defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.2) that does not require institutionalization, that the [inmate] incarcerated person failed to fully participate in or cooperate with all prescribed treatment offered during incarceration. (cf: P.L.2011, c.67, s.1) 53.  Section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59) is amended to read as follows: 15.  a. Each adult parolee shall at all times remain in the legal custody of the Commissioner of Corrections and under the supervision of the State Parole Board, except that the Commissioner of Corrections, after providing notice to the Attorney General, may consent to the supervision of a parolee by the federal government pursuant to the Witness Security Reform Act, Pub.L.98-473 (18 U.S.C. s.3521 et seq.).  An adult parolee, except those under the Witness Security Reform Act, shall remain under the supervision of the State Parole Board and in the legal custody of the Department of Corrections in accordance with the policies and rules of the board. b. (1) (a) Each parolee shall agree, as evidenced by his signature to abide by specific conditions of parole established by the appropriate board panel which shall be enumerated in writing in a certificate of parole and shall be given to the parolee upon release. Such conditions shall include, among other things, a requirement that the parolee conduct himself in society in compliance with all laws and refrain from committing any crime, a requirement that the parolee will not own or possess any firearm as defined in subsection f. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 or any other weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1, a requirement that the parolee refrain from the unlawful use, or the possession or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance, controlled substance analog or imitation controlled dangerous substance as defined in N.J.S.2C:35-2 and N.J.S.2C:35-11, other than possession of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10, and distribution of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (12) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5, a requirement that the parolee obtain permission from his parole officer for any change in his residence, and a requirement that the parolee report at reasonable intervals to an assigned parole officer.  In addition, based on prior history of the parolee or information provided by a victim or a member of the family of a murder victim, the member or board panel certifying parole release pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55) may impose any other specific conditions of parole deemed reasonable in order to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of criminal or delinquent behavior, including a requirement that the parolee comply with the Internet access conditions set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  Such special conditions may include, among other things, a requirement that the parolee make full or partial restitution, the amount of which restitution shall be set by the sentencing court upon request of the board.  In addition, the member or board panel certifying parole release may, giving due regard to a victim's request, impose a special condition that the parolee have no contact with the victim, which special condition may include, but need not be limited to, restraining the parolee from entering the victims residence, place of employment, business or school, and from harassing or stalking the victim or victims relatives in any way.  Further, the member, board panel or board certifying parole release may impose a special condition that the person shall not own or possess an animal for an unlawful purpose or to interfere in the performance of duties by a parole officer. (b)   The member or board panel certifying parole release shall not impose on any parolee any condition that would prohibit or restrict manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing, or possessing or having under control with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (12) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5, or possession of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10. (2)   In addition, the member or board panel certifying parole release may impose on any person who has been convicted for the commission of a sex offense as defined in subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2), and who is required to register as provided in subsections c. and d. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2), or who has been convicted for a violation of N.J.S.2C:34-3 any of the following Internet access conditions: (a)   Prohibit the person from accessing or using a computer or any other device with Internet capability without the prior written approval of the court, except the person may use a computer or any other device with Internet capability in connection with that persons employment or search for employment with the prior approval of the persons parole officer; (b)   Require the person to submit to periodic unannounced examinations of the persons computer or any other device with Internet capability by a parole officer, law enforcement officer or assigned computer or information technology specialist, including the retrieval and copying of all data from the computer or device and any internal or external peripherals and removal of such information, equipment or device to conduct a more thorough inspection; (c)   Require the person to submit to the installation on the persons computer or device with Internet capability, at the persons expense, one or more hardware or software systems to monitor the Internet use; and (d)   Require the person to submit to any other appropriate restrictions concerning the persons use or access of a computer or any other device with Internet capability. c.     The appropriate board panel may in writing relieve a parolee of any parole conditions, and may permit a parolee to reside outside the State pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision (N.J.S.2A:168-14 et seq.) and, with the consent of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections after providing notice to the Attorney General, the federal Witness Security Reform Act, if satisfied that the change will not result in a substantial likelihood that the parolee will commit an offense which would be a crime under the laws of this State.  The appropriate board panel may revoke permission, except in the case of a parolee under the Witness Security Reform Act, or reinstate relieved parole conditions for any period of time during which a parolee is under its jurisdiction. d.    The appropriate board panel may parole an [inmate] incarcerated person to any residential facility funded in whole or in part by the State if the [inmate] incarcerated person would not otherwise be released pursuant to section 9 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.53) without such placement.  But if the residential facility provides treatment for mental illness or mental retardation, the board panel only may parole the [inmate] incarcerated person to the facility pursuant to the laws and admissions policies that otherwise govern the admission of persons to that facility, and the facility shall have the authority to discharge the [inmate] incarcerated person according to the laws and policies that otherwise govern the discharge of persons from the facility, on 10 days prior notice to the board panel.  The board panel shall acknowledge receipt of this notice in writing prior to the discharge.  Upon receipt of the notice the board panel shall resume jurisdiction over the [inmate] incarcerated person. e.     Parole officers shall provide assistance to the parolee in obtaining employment, education, or vocational training or in meeting other obligations to assure the parolees compliance with meeting legal requirements related to sex offender notification, address changes and participation in rehabilitation programs as directed by the assigned parole officer. f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) g.    If the board has granted parole to any [inmate] incarcerated person from a State correctional facility and the court has imposed a fine on the [inmate] incarcerated person, the appropriate board panel shall release the [inmate] incarcerated person on condition that the parolee make specified fine payments to the State Parole Board.  For violation of these conditions, or for violation of a special condition requiring restitution, parole may be revoked only for refusal or failure to make a good faith effort to make the payment. h.    Upon collection of the fine the Department of Corrections shall forward it to the State Treasury. (cf: P.L.2021, c.19, s.13) 54.  Section 1 of P.L.2020, c.111 (C.30:4-123.100) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a. In addition to credits awarded pursuant to R.S.30:4-92; section 3 of P.L.2009, c.330 (C.30:4-92a); and R.S.30:4-140, whenever a public health emergency, pursuant to the Emergency Health Powers Act, P.L.2005, c.222 (C.26:13-1 et seq.), has been declared by the Governor and is in effect, the commissioner also shall award [inmates] incarcerated persons public health emergency credits in accordance with this section if the public health emergency: (1)   arises as a result of a communicable or infectious disease;

(2) Average annual payroll means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher, except that any year or years throughout which an employer has had no annual payroll because of military service shall be deleted from the reckoning; the average annual payroll in such case is to be determined on the basis of the prior three or five calendar years in each of which the employer had an annual payroll in the operation of his business, if the employer resumes his business within 12 months after separation, discharge or release from such service, under conditions other than dishonorable, and makes application to have his average annual payroll determined on the basis of such deletion within 12 months after he resumes his business; provided, however, that average annual payroll solely for the purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-7 means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer on which he paid contributions to the State disability benefits fund for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher; provided further that only those wages be included on which employer contributions have been paid on or before January 31 (or the next succeeding day if such January 31 is a Saturday or Sunday) immediately preceding the beginning of the 12-month period for which the employers contribution rate is computed. (b) Benefits means the money payments payable to an individual, as provided in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), with respect to his unemployment. (c) (1) Base year with respect to benefit years commencing on or after July 1, 1986, shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding an individuals benefit year. With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after July 1, 1995, if an individual does not have sufficient qualifying weeks or wages in his base year to qualify for benefits, the individual shall have the option of designating that his base year shall be the alternative base year, which means the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individuals benefit year; except that, with respect to a benefit year commencing on or after October 1, 1995, if the individual also does not have sufficient qualifying weeks or wages in the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding his benefit year to qualify for benefits, alternative base year means the last three completed calendar quarters immediately preceding his benefit year and, of the calendar quarter in which the benefit year commences, the portion of the quarter which occurs before the commencing of the benefit year. The division shall inform the individual of his options under this section as amended by P.L.1995, c.234.  If information regarding weeks and wages for the calendar quarter or quarters immediately preceding the benefit year is not available to the division from the regular quarterly reports of wage information and the division is not able to obtain the information using other means pursuant to State or federal law, the division may base the determination of eligibility for benefits on the affidavit of an individual with respect to weeks and wages for that calendar quarter.  The individual shall furnish payroll documentation, if available, in support of the affidavit.  A determination of benefits based on an alternative base year shall be adjusted when the quarterly report of wage information from the employer is received if that information causes a change in the determination. (2) With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who immediately preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable under the provisions of the Temporary Disability Benefits Law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et seq.), base year shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individuals period of disability, if the employment held by the individual immediately preceding the period of disability is no longer available at the conclusion of that period and the individual files a valid claim for unemployment benefits after the conclusion of that period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, period of disability means the period defined as a period of disability by section 3 of the Temporary Disability Benefits Law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27).  An individual who files a claim under the provisions of this paragraph (2) shall not be regarded as having left work voluntarily for the purposes of subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-5. (3) With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who immediately preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable under the provisions of the workers compensation law (chapter 15 of Title 34 of the Revised Statutes), base year shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individuals period of disability, if the period of disability was not longer than two years, if the employment held by the individual immediately preceding the period of disability is no longer available at the conclusion of that period and if the individual files a valid claim for unemployment benefits after the conclusion of that period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, period of disability means the period from the time at which the individual becomes unable to work because of the compensable disability until the time that the individual becomes able to resume work and continue work on a permanent basis.  An individual who files a claim under the provisions of this paragraph (3) shall not be regarded as having left work voluntarily for the purposes of subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-5. (d) Benefit year with respect to any individual means the 364 consecutive calendar days beginning with the day on, or as of, which he first files a valid claim for benefits, and thereafter beginning with the day on, or as of, which the individual next files a valid claim for benefits after the termination of his last preceding benefit year.  Any claim for benefits made in accordance with subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-6 shall be deemed to be a valid claim for the purpose of this subsection if (1) he is unemployed for the week in which, or as of which, he files a claim for benefits; and (2) he has fulfilled the conditions imposed by subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-4. (e) (1) Division means the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and any transaction or exercise of authority by the director of the division thereunder, or under this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), shall be deemed to be performed by the division.

(3) The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as requiring or permitting a waiver of the recovery of any overpayments of unemployment benefits if the waiver is prohibited by any federal law, regulation or administrative directive.  A recovery shall not be waived unless the division determines that the claimant is without fault and the repayment would be contrary to equity and good conscience in the case of the recovery of an overpayment of benefit under any of the following programs authorized by the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Pub.L.116-136: Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), Mixed Earners Unemployment Compensation (MEUC), Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), or the first week of regular Unemployment Compensation that is reimbursed in accordance with Section 2105 of the CARES Act.
