(New section) This act shall not impair the validity of the compensation provisions of a municipal employment contract for a person appointed as a constable which was entered into prior to the effective date of this act.  If applicable, a person appointed as a constable shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of a municipal employment contract until the contract expires.  However, any provisions of the contract which grant powers and impose duties associated with the position of constable shall be deemed null and void. 53.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill eliminates the position of constable, removes statutory references to the position, and repeals certain sections of law to reflect this change. Under the bill, the salary provisions of a municipal employment contract for a constable which was entered into prior to the effective date of the bill would remain in effect and the person would be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the contract until the contract expires. However, any provisions of the contract which grant powers and impose duties associated with the position of constable would be deemed null and void. The bill implements recommendations set forth in the December 2021 report of the State of New Jersey Commission of Investigation (SCI) entitled, Abusing the Badge, A report on the SCIs Investigation into Constables in New Jersey. In its report, the SCI deems the position of constable unnecessary and outdated, and calls for the elimination of the position before someone gets seriously injured or worse. The SCI investigation found that, rather than serve as a beneficial adjunct to police, the role of constable instead far too frequently represents a potential hazard to the constables themselves, the police, and the public at large.

(cf: R.S.53:4-1) 50.  R.S.56:3-47 is amended to read as follows: 56:3-47.  If any owner, dealer or shipper, or his agent, has reason to believe, and does believe, that any can or cans of the kind mentioned in section 56:3-42 of this Title, stamped or marked as provided in said section 56:3-42, is or are being used, or has or have been unlawfully used as aforesaid, by any person, or that any person has any such can or cans secreted in or upon his premises, or any other place, any such owner, dealer or shipper, or his agent, may go before the Superior Court or the municipal court in the municipality wherein such offenses may be or have been committed, and make complaint thereof under oath, which complaint may be wholly upon information and belief. Whereupon the court shall issue a process in the nature of a search warrant, directed to any [constable,] marshal or an executive officer of any municipality, which shall recite the complaint, or the substance thereof, and shall command such [constable,] marshal or executive officer to search immediately the premises, place or places mentioned in the complaint, and, if any milk or cream cans be found, to bring the same, together with the body of the person in whose possession they may be found, before the court which shall summarily inquire into the ownership of such can or cans, and, upon being satisfied that the same belong to such owner, dealer or shipper, or that his agent is entitled to the possession thereof, he shall deliver such can or cans to such owner, dealer or shipper, or his agent, who shall have the costs of the proceedings from the person so illegally having such can or cans in his or their possession.

(cf: P.L.1991, c.91, s.523) 51.  The following sections are repealed: N.J.S.2A:14-18; N.J.S.40A:9-120 through N.J.S.40A:9-126; and N.J.S.40A:9-126.1 52. (New section) This act shall not impair the validity of the compensation provisions of a municipal employment contract for a person appointed as a constable which was entered into prior to the effective date of this act.  If applicable, a person appointed as a constable shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of a municipal employment contract until the contract expires.  However, any provisions of the contract which grant powers and impose duties associated with the position of constable shall be deemed null and void. 53.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill eliminates the position of constable, removes statutory references to the position, and repeals certain sections of law to reflect this change. Under the bill, the salary provisions of a municipal employment contract for a constable which was entered into prior to the effective date of the bill would remain in effect and the person would be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the contract until the contract expires. However, any provisions of the contract which grant powers and impose duties associated with the position of constable would be deemed null and void. The bill implements recommendations set forth in the December 2021 report of the State of New Jersey Commission of Investigation (SCI) entitled, Abusing the Badge, A report on the SCIs Investigation into Constables in New Jersey. In its report, the SCI deems the position of constable unnecessary and outdated, and calls for the elimination of the position before someone gets seriously injured or worse. The SCI investigation found that, rather than serve as a beneficial adjunct to police, the role of constable instead far too frequently represents a potential hazard to the constables themselves, the police, and the public at large.
