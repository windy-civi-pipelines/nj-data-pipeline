During a student's enrollment in a county college after the first year of enrollment, the scholarship shall be payable to that student if the student attains a grade point average of at least 3.0 by the start of the student's second year of county college enrollment.  A student who attains a grade point average of less than 3.0 at the start of the second semester of the student's first year of county college enrollment shall participate in an enrichment program designed by the county college during the second semester of the student's first year of enrollment. c.     To be eligible to receive a scholarship under the NJ STARS Program a student shall: (1)   be a State resident pursuant to guidelines established by the authority.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1 of P.L.1979, c.361 (C.18A:62-4) or any other section of law to the contrary, a dependent child of a parent or guardian who has been transferred to a military installation located in this State shall be considered a resident of this State for the purposes of qualifying for an NJ STARS scholarship; (2)   have applied for all other available forms of State and federal need-based grants and merit scholarships, exclusive of loans, the full amount of which grants and scholarships shall be applied to tuition to reduce the amount of any scholarship that the student shall receive under the provisions of this act; (3)   except as otherwise provided pursuant to subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2008, c.124 (C.18A:71B-85.2), be enrolled in a full-time course of study at a New Jersey county college; (4)   have graduated from high school in 2004 or later or completed a high school curriculum through equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school in 2018 or later, and not earlier than the calendar year two years prior to the first calendar year in which a scholarship payment is to be made; and (5)   except as otherwise provided pursuant to subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2008, c.124 (C.18A:71B-85.2), maintain continuous enrollment in a full-time course of study, unless on medical leave due to the illness of the student or a member of the student's immediate family or emergency leave because of a family emergency, which medical or emergency leave shall have been approved by the county college, or unless called to partial or full mobilization for State or federal active duty as a member of the National Guard or a Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States. d.    A student who is dismissed for academic or disciplinary reasons from a county college shall no longer be eligible for a scholarship under this act.  If a student participating in the program is dismissed for disciplinary reasons, the student shall repay in full all amounts received under the program.  The county college shall be responsible for collecting the repayment, or the amount of any overpayment or other improper payment, of any State awards under the program, in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.18A:71B-10. e.     A student scholarship under the NJ STARS Program may be renewed upon the student's filing of a renewal financial aid application and providing evidence that the student has satisfied the requirements pursuant to subsection b. of this section.

STATEMENT This bill includes in the NJ STARS Program students who receive equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school, such as home-schooled students.  Under the bill's provisions, a NJ STARS scholarship will be payable to a student who receives equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school for the student's first year of enrollment in a county college if the student meets academic achievement criteria as determined by the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority.  Eligibility for a scholarship for the student's second year of enrollment in a county college would remain as it is currently for all NJ STARS scholarship recipients, based upon academic performance in the first year of county college enrollment.  Students who receive equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school will be eligible to receive a scholarship beginning in the 2018-2019 academic year.
