(3)   The department shall make the forms available on the Internet website of the department and shall furnish copies of the form upon request. c.     The department shall retrieve the information as provided in paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section, to the fullest extent possible based upon availability, from State and local government agencies, including municipalities and housing authorities, that receive applications for affordable housing. d.    The commissioner shall, by January 31 of each year, prepare a report compiling all the information collected in the prior year under the program, categorized by municipality for which affordable housing is desired, and shall provide a copy of the report to the Council on Affordable Housing, or its successor, to help the council ascertain the demand for affordable housing that currently exists in each municipality in the State. 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment.
