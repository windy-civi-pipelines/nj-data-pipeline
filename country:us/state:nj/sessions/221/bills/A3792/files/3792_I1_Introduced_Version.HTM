The bill prohibits a person from operating a motorized skateboard at a speed greater than 10 miles per hour. A person under the age of 16 who operates a motorized skateboard in violation of the bills provisions would be warned of the violation by the enforcing official.  The parent or legal guardian of the violator may be fined a maximum of $25 for a first offense and a maximum of $100 for a subsequent offense. In addition to the requirements under current law, a business selling or renting motorized skateboards would be required to post a sign at the point where the sale or rental transaction is completed stating: STATE LAW PROHIBITS ANY PERSON UNDER 16 YEARS OF AGE FROM OPERATING A MOTORIZED SKATEBOARD AND REQUIRES A PERSON TO WEAR A HELMET WHEN USING A MOTORIZED SKATEBOARD. This bill is similar to a California law that regulates the use of motorized skateboards.
