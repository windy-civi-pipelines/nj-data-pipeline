The Legislature further finds and declares that a certain portion of the [pinelands area] John McPhee pinelands area is especially vulnerable to the environmental degradation of surface and ground waters which would be occasioned by the improper development  or use thereof;  that the degradation of such waters would result in a severe  adverse impact upon the entire [pinelands area] John McPhee pinelands area;  that it is necessary to  designate this portion as a preservation area, wherein more stringent  restrictions on the development and use of land should be utilized and public  acquisition of land or interests therein should be concentrated; and, that in  order to facilitate such acquisition, and otherwise to effectuate the  provisions of [this act] P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and the Federal Act, it is further necessary to establish certain notice requirements and procedures for the purchase of land or interests therein in such area. The Legislature further finds and declares that the current pace of random and uncoordinated development and construction in the [pinelands area] John McPhee pinelands area poses an immediate threat to the resources thereof, especially to the survival of rare, threatened and endangered plant and animal species and the habitat thereof, and  to the maintenance of the existing high quality of surface and ground waters;   that such development and construction increase the risk and extent of  destruction of life and property which could be caused by the natural cycle of  forest fires in this unique area;  and, that, in order to effectuate the  purposes and provisions of [this act]  P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and the Federal Act, it is necessary to  impose certain interim limitations upon the local approval of applications for development in the preservation area, and upon certain State and local approvals in the [pinelands area] John McPhee pinelands area, all as hereinafter provided.

He currently serves as the Ferris Professor of Journalism teaching nonfiction writing at Princeton University. McPhees renowned contributions to the nonfiction literature genre has earned him multiple literary awards and honors. In McPhees 1968 book, The Pine Barrens, he illustrates a rich portrait of the culture, history, and ecology of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, also known as the Pinelands. McPhee believed the Pinelands was the last vestige of wilderness on the east coast and advocated for it to become a national reserve. A decade after its publication, this book was pivotal in the political battle to preserve the Pinelands from being destroyed by overdevelopment. During the late 1970s, the United States Congress passed the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 establishing the Pinelands National Reserve and authorizing the creation of a planning entity for the area.  Governor Brendan Byrne, with support from environmentalists, pushed for State legislation to preserve the Pinelands, widely crediting John McPhees book, The Pine Barrens, for the inspiration to pursue this legislation. As a result, the Legislature adopted the Pinelands Protection Act in 1979, which protects sensitive areas and high quality surface and ground water, agricultural and cultural areas, and provides for regional planning to protect the sensitive ecosystem from the pressures of development. The pinelands is the largest remaining example of the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecosystem, stretching across more than a fifth of the States land area. The areas forests and wetlands are home to 1,000 species of native flowering plants, 280 mosses, 34 mammal species, 24 amphibian species, 30 reptile species, and 144 bird species. Unique to the Pinelands is a 17-trillion-gallon Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer, containing some of the purest water in the United States.  Congress has officially designated 1.1 million acres of the area as the Pinelands National Reserve to preserve its ecology, making it the first National Reserve in the country. Appropriately, renaming the pinelands area as the John McPhee pinelands area is a fitting tribute to the inspiration he provided for legislation protecting the New Jersey Pine Barrens.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.170, s.3) 47.  R.S.58:4-1 is amended to read as follows: 58:4-1.  a.  No municipality, corporation or person shall, without the consent of the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, hereafter in this chapter designated as the commissioner, build any reservoir or construct any dam, or repair, alter or improve existing dams on any river or stream in this State or between this State and any other state which will raise the waters of the river or stream more than five feet above its usual mean low-water height. No municipality, corporation or person shall, without the consent of the commissioner, build any reservoir or construct any dam, or repair, alter or improve existing dams in the [pinelands area] John McPhee pinelands area, as designated by subsection a. of section 10 of P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-11), which will raise the waters of any river or stream more than eight feet above the surface of the ground where the drainage area above the dam or reservoir is more than one square mile in extent and where the water surface created by the dam or reservoir is more than 100 acres in extent. The commissioner may investigate and take appropriate action regarding any dam or reservoir about which the commissioner has a security or safety concern. With respect to dams and reservoirs located on lands utilized for agricultural or horticultural purposes within the [pinelands area] John McPhee pinelands area, the commissioner's actions shall be undertaken after consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture. b.    The commissioner shall not require a permit for the repair of any dam used for agricultural purposes within a special agricultural production area designated pursuant to N.J.A.C.7:50-5.14 in the [pinelands area] John McPhee pinelands area. (cf: P.L.2001, c.82, s.1) 48.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill renames the pinelands area as the John McPhee pinelands area. John McPhee, a native of Princeton, New Jersey and a Pulitzer Prize author, is considered one of the pioneers of creative nonfiction literature. McPhees writing career spans over five decades, during which he has published over thirty books and contributed over 100 articles to The New Yorker as a staff writer since 1963. He currently serves as the Ferris Professor of Journalism teaching nonfiction writing at Princeton University. McPhees renowned contributions to the nonfiction literature genre has earned him multiple literary awards and honors. In McPhees 1968 book, The Pine Barrens, he illustrates a rich portrait of the culture, history, and ecology of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, also known as the Pinelands. McPhee believed the Pinelands was the last vestige of wilderness on the east coast and advocated for it to become a national reserve. A decade after its publication, this book was pivotal in the political battle to preserve the Pinelands from being destroyed by overdevelopment. During the late 1970s, the United States Congress passed the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 establishing the Pinelands National Reserve and authorizing the creation of a planning entity for the area.  Governor Brendan Byrne, with support from environmentalists, pushed for State legislation to preserve the Pinelands, widely crediting John McPhees book, The Pine Barrens, for the inspiration to pursue this legislation. As a result, the Legislature adopted the Pinelands Protection Act in 1979, which protects sensitive areas and high quality surface and ground water, agricultural and cultural areas, and provides for regional planning to protect the sensitive ecosystem from the pressures of development. The pinelands is the largest remaining example of the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecosystem, stretching across more than a fifth of the States land area. The areas forests and wetlands are home to 1,000 species of native flowering plants, 280 mosses, 34 mammal species, 24 amphibian species, 30 reptile species, and 144 bird species. Unique to the Pinelands is a 17-trillion-gallon Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer, containing some of the purest water in the United States.  Congress has officially designated 1.1 million acres of the area as the Pinelands National Reserve to preserve its ecology, making it the first National Reserve in the country. Appropriately, renaming the pinelands area as the John McPhee pinelands area is a fitting tribute to the inspiration he provided for legislation protecting the New Jersey Pine Barrens.
