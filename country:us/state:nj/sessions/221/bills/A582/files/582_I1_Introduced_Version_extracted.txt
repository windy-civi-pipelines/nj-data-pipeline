(cf: P.L.2021, c.171, s.4) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would make various changes to the provisions of P.L.2021, c.171 (C.40:55D-66.18 et seq.), which establishes certain requirements for the installation of electric vehicle chargers and "Make-Ready parking spaces," which are parking spaces that are prewired for the installation of electric vehicle chargers, at certain multi-unit dwellings, parking lots, and garages. Specifically, the bill would clarify that certain provisions of P.L.2021, c.171 (C.40:55D-66.18 et seq.) apply only to applications for the construction or reconstruction of certain multi-unit dwellings, parking lots, and garages, rather than to any applications involving those structures.  The bill would exempt multi-unit dwellings that are entirely restricted to occupancy as low- or moderate- income housing from the requirement to install a certain number of Make-Ready parking spaces.  The bill would clarify that parking spaces that are restricted from installing electric vehicle chargers would not be counted in the total number of off-street parking spaces, for the purposes of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2021, c.171 (C.40:55D-66.20).  The bill would also clarify that, in the case of the construction or reconstruction of a multi-unit dwelling, the number of Make-Ready off-street parking spaces required pursuant to subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2021, c.171 (C.40:55D-66.20) would be in proportion to the new or reconstructed multi-unit dwelling and not the entire existing development. In addition, the bill would provide that a municipality would be required to use the total number of parking spaces that will actually be provided in a new or reconstructed parking lot or garage, regardless of whether those spaces are pre-existing, new, or reconstructed spaces and, in the event that an applicant for site plan approval has requested a parking variance as part of the application, regardless of the number of spaces required by ordinance, for the purposes of complying with section 3 of P.L.2021, c.171 (C.40:55D-66.20). The bill would remove provisions in current law that require certain amendments to the (1) Statewide site improvement standards for multifamily residential development, and (2) the State Uniform Construction Code, carried out by the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2021, c.171 (C.40:55D-66.20), to be consistent with the model land use ordinance published by the commissioner pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2021, c.171 (C.40:55D-66.21).  The bill would remove the authority of the commissioner to update the electric vehicle charger and Make-Ready parking space requirements established pursuant to subsections a. and b. of section 3 of P.L.2021, c.171 (C.40:55D-66.20).  The bill would instead authorize the commissioner to update elements of the model land use ordinance discussed above, but would require the commissioner to do so in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).
