Public agencies shall identify those projects and shall notify the division.  A political subdivision shall have the responsibility of certifying the eligibility of a women's business or minority business to bid on contracts or otherwise represent itself as a women's business or minority business within the political subdivision, except that, if the business is certified by the division to represent itself as being a minority or women's business under State programs, the political subdivision may accept that certification for eligibility of the business under programs of the political subdivision.  A political subdivision shall utilize the uniform certification procedure formulated by the division; i.     Submit to the Governor and the Legislature an annual report regarding its activities and setting forth recommendations of methods which might be utilized to more efficiently and effectively carry out the purposes of this act, and submit to the commissioner periodic reports on the condition of small businesses, and women's and minority businesses in the State; and j.     Provide any other services which it deems necessary or which may be requested by the authority. (cf: P.L.2003, c.189, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would modify the eligibility criteria for a business to qualify as a minority-owned or women-owned business under State law.  The bill specifies that an otherwise eligible minority-owned or women-owned business engaged in the procurement of materials and supplies would be eligible for certification although the business is not involved in the production or movement of inventory on hand, as long as the business: (1)  places an order for a product with a distributor or manufacturer; (2)  takes possession of the materials or supplies in the order by payment; (3)  assumes the risk of ownership of the materials or supplies; and (4)  causes the product, materials, or supplies to be shipped to a customer. The bill also requires the uniform procedure, which governs the certification of minority and womens businesses, to provide guidance for determining whether the beneficial owners of a business have created a shell company or other arrangement with the purpose or effect of evading the ownership requirements under the law.
