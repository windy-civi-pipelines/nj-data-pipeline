S3619 SENATE, No. 3619 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED SEPTEMBER 19, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  BOB SMITH District 17 (Middlesex and Somerset) Senator  JOHN F. MCKEON District 27 (Essex and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Requires filtration system to capture microfibers and microplastics on washing machines sold on or after January 1, 2030. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the capture of microfibers and microplastics on certain appliances, and supplementing Title 58 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The Legislature finds that microfibers, tiny thread-like pieces of plastic, are the most common form of microplastic pollution in the environment; that a single load of laundry can release up to 18 million microfibers into the water used in the washing process; that scientists have recently estimated that 5.6 million metric tons of synthetic microfibers were emitted from washing machines between 1950 and 2016, and approximately 2.8 million metric tons were emitted in the last decade; that, in addition to harming marine wildlife and the ecosystems that our communities depend on, microplastics enter our bodies in the food we eat, the water we drink, and in the air we breathe; and that adding filters to washing machines can drastically reduce the amount of microfibers and microplastics in the environment by as much as 90 percent. The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the interest of the public prevent the proliferation of microfiber and microplastic pollution by requiring filtration systems that can capture microfibers and microplastics on all washing machines sold in the State. 2.  As used in this act: Department means the Department of Environmental Protection. Microfiber means a synthetic fiber intentionally woven or imbedded into a textile that is shed when the textile is washed. Microfiber filtration system means a filtering system that is active across all washing cycles, is integrated into the washing machine as a built-in filter or as an in-line filter packaged, sold, and installed in the washing machine, and is designed to capture microfibers and microplastics from the water used in the washing process before the water is released from the washing machine into the wastewater system. Microplastic means a piece of plastic that is five millimeters or less in diameter. 3.  On or after January 1, 2030, no person shall sell or offer for sale in the State a new washing machine for residential, commercial, or State use unless the washing machine: (1) contains a microfiber filtration system with a mesh size of not greater than 100 micrometers; and (2) bears a conspicuous label that is visible to the consumer, in the form of a sticker or any other label type, that includes the following statement: NOTICE: THIS WASHING MACHINE CONTAINS A FILTER TO CAPTURE MICROFIBERS.  CHECK THE FILTER REGULARLY AND DISPOSE OF CAPTURED LINT IN A WASTE BIN. 4.  A person in violation of section 3 of this act shall be liable for a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for a first violation, and up to $30,000 for each subsequent violation, to be collected in a civil action commenced by the Department of Environmental Protection, in a summary proceeding under the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction over proceedings for the enforcement of the penalty established by this section. 5.  No later than one year after the effective date of this act, the Department of Environmental Protection shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of this act. 6.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill prohibits the sale or offer for sale, on or after January 1, 2030, of a new washing machine for residential, commercial, or State use unless the washing machine: (1) contains a microfiber filtration system with a mesh size of not greater than 100 micrometers; and (2) bears a conspicuous label that is visible to the consumer, in the form of a sticker or any other label type, that includes the following statement: NOTICE: THIS WASHING MACHINE CONTAINS A FILTER TO CAPTURE MICROFIBERS.  CHECK THE FILTER REGULARLY AND DISPOSE OF CAPTURED LINT IN A WASTE BIN. The bill also establishes a civil penalty for violations of the bills provisions of up to $10,000 for a first violation, and up to $30,000 for each subsequent violation, to be collected by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in a civil action by a summary proceeding under the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999. Finally, the bill authorizes the DEP to adopt regulations necessary to implement the bills provisions.
