CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Assembly Resolution urging the President of the United States and the United States Congress to enact legislation granting amnesty and providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Whereas, Currently, more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living and working in the United States are in need of a pathway to citizenship to increase productivity, boost the economy, reduce illegal immigration, and provide a sense of relief; and Whereas, The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, signed into law by President Reagan in November 1986, provided a path for lawful legal residence to nearly three million immigrants who had arrived in the United States prior to January 1, 1982; and Whereas, The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 decreased the amount of illegal immigration into the country, increased wages, and bettered the working conditions of immigrants; and Whereas, The act improved the overall economic, health, and educational outcomes of the immigrants who were granted amnesty; and Whereas, Immigrants have made significant contributions to American society and current law confines millions to a life in the shadows, without full access or ability to be economically, politically, or socially engaged members of society; and Whereas, Undocumented immigrants are often economically exploited, earning less per hour than native-born workers, are often confined to work in low-skill industries, and are often taken advantage of by their employers; and Whereas, Allowing undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship will have significant economic impact in terms of growth, earnings,  tax revenue, and jobs for all American workers; and Whereas, The 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States have lived here, on average, for the last 16 years and a majority of Americans support putting these undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship; and Whereas, Legalization and citizenship are essential to protecting and integrating immigrants into the fabric of American society; and Whereas, The President of the United States and the United States Congress should enact legislation to grant amnesty to undocumented immigrants, provide an eight-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and pursue stricter provisions to protect the United States border; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This House respectfully urges the President of the United States and the United States Congress to enact legislation granting amnesty and providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the President and Vice-President of the United States, the Majority and Minority leaders of the United States Congress, and each member of Congress elected from New Jersey. STATEMENT This resolution urges the President of the United States and the United States Congress to enact legislation granting amnesty and providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  Currently, more than 11 million undocumented immigrants are living in the shadows of the United States economy.  These immigrants are in need of legalization and a pathway to citizenship. Immigrants have made significant contributions to American society, but current law confines millions of productive immigrants in low skill industries, unable to participate fully in the political, economic, and social spheres in the United States. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was signed into law by President Reagan.  Close to three million immigrants who had arrived in the United States before January 1, 1982 were granted amnesty.  The act improved the overall health, economic, and educational outcomes of the immigrants. Undocumented immigrants are often economically exploited, earning less per hour than their native-born counterparts.  Legalization and a pathway to citizenship are essential to protecting and integrating immigrants into American society.  Allowing undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship will have significant impact on economic growth, earnings, tax revenue, and jobs.
