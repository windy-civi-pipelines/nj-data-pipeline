(cf: P.L.2007, c.335, s.16) 7.    (New section)  a.  Any regulations adopted by the board pursuant to section 16 of P.L.2007, c.335 (C.39:2A-36.1) prior to the effective date of P.L.    , c.   (C.      )(pending before the Legislature as this bill) increasing fees collected pursuant to R.S.39:3-13, R.S.39:3-20, R.S.39:3-21, R.S.39:10-11, R.S.39:10-12, R.S.39:10-14, and R.S.39:10-16 are hereby rescinded. b.    The board is directed to rescind regulations adopted after March 5, 2009 and prior to the effective date of P.L.     , c.    (C.      )(pending before the Legislature as this bill) increasing fees under N.J.A.C.13:82-9.1. c.     All revenues collected from fees increased pursuant to regulations rescinded under subsection a. or b. of this section shall be refunded to the person who paid the fees. 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill removes the power of the board of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission to increase fees by regulation in regard to: R.S.39:3-13 (fees for permits and articulated vehicle endorsements); R.S.39:3-20 (fees for registration of commercial motor vehicles based on weight); R.S.39:3-21 (motorcycle registration fee); R.S.39:10-11 (motor vehicle certificate of ownership fees); R.S.39:10-12 (duplicate certificate of ownership fee); R.S.39:10-14 (fees for lien or change of title search); and R.S.39:10-16 (fee for corrected certificate of ownership).  The bill amends existing law to set by statute the amount of certain boating certificate of ownership fees rather than to let the fees be established by regulation.  The fees are established at the current rates.  The bill also rescinds or requires the rescinding of any regulations increasing the above mentioned fees adopted by the board of the commission before the date this bill becomes law.  This bill is in response to a rule proposal (41 N.J.R.862(a)) by the Motor Vehicle Commission to adopt regulations to increase fees in the above-mentioned areas.  Of particular concern is the proposal to increase the fee for motorcycle registration from $10 to $65 (a more than 600% increase) and the fee for motor vehicle and boat certificates of ownership from $20 to $60 (a 300% increase).

When the owner is a corporation, it shall be sufficient if the financing statement is signed by any officer thereof, or by any agent designated by the corporation for that purpose, and it shall not be necessary that the financing statement recite the authorization of the agent.  When there is more than one owner, it shall be sufficient if the financing statement is signed by any one of them. e.     Nothing in subsections c. and d. of this section shall apply to a security interest in marine equipment which constitutes inventory held for sale, but the interest shall be subject to chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes. f.     In addition to the fees elsewhere in this section provided for, there shall be paid to the [director] chief administrator a fee of $10 for notice of satisfaction of the lien or encumbrance of the record or abstract, or of the termination of the security interest where the marine equipment is subject to a lien or encumbrance or a security interest. g.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, when any dealer is the purchaser of any marine equipment in this State, [he] the dealer shall, within 10 days after its purchase, submit to the [director] chief administrator the evidence of purchase.  Upon presentation of the certificate of ownership with proper assignment and certification of the seller to the [director] chief administrator, a record of the transaction shall be made and filed.  A certificate of ownership shall be issued by the [director] chief administrator and delivered to the purchaser, and the [director] chief administrator shall collect a fee for the issuing and filing thereof.  A purchaser of any marine equipment who fails to comply with the provisions of this subsection shall pay the [director] chief administrator a penalty plus the issuing and filing fee. h.    The failure of a person to comply with the requirements of this section shall constitute a violation within the provisions of section 25 of this act, but the failure shall not affect the validity of any instrument creating or reserving a security interest in any marine equipment as between the parties to the instrument. i.     The notation of the name and business or residence address of a secured party or his assignee on the certificate of origin or on the certificate of ownership, as provided in sections 9 and 10 of this act, and the presentation to the [director] chief administrator of the certificate of origin or certificate of ownership so noted, in the compliance with the security interest filing requirements of this act, shall be in lieu of all filing requirements imposed by chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes and shall constitute the perfection of the security interest in the marine equipment, and the rights and remedies of the debtors and the secured parties in respect to the security interest shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in this act, be subject to and governed by chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes. j.     Any security interest perfected pursuant to chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes not later than 30 days after either the effective date of [this] P.L.1987 [amendatory act], c.138 or June 15, 1987, whichever date is later, shall remain perfected pursuant to that Title 12A until perfected as required under P.L.1984, c.152 (C.12:7A-1 et seq.).  For this category of security interest, perfection in accordance with P.L.1984, c.152 shall occur not later than one year after either the effective date of [this] P.L.1987 [amendatory act] ,c.138 or June 15, 1987, whichever date is later.  For this category of security interest, the subsequent perfection under P.L. 1984, c.152 shall be deemed to be a continuation of the initial perfection pursuant to chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes. (cf: P.L.1987, c.138, s.6) 2.    Section 13 of P.L.1984, c.152 (C.12:7A-13) is amended to read as follows: 13.  a.  If a certificate of ownership or title papers are lost, the [director] chief administrator may, upon proof by certification or otherwise in the manner required by [him] the chief administrator and if satisfied with the application, prepare a certificate of ownership, certify it, and authorize its use in place of the original, with the same effect as the original.  The [director] chief administrator shall collect a fee of $25 for this duplicate certificate. b.    A person who falsely states, in an application to the [director] chief administrator for a duplicate certificate of ownership, that a certificate of ownership or title papers are lost, shall be subject to the penalties of section 25 of this act. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a prosecution may be commenced at any time up to three years after the issuance of the duplicate certificate.

STATEMENT This bill removes the power of the board of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission to increase fees by regulation in regard to: R.S.39:3-13 (fees for permits and articulated vehicle endorsements); R.S.39:3-20 (fees for registration of commercial motor vehicles based on weight); R.S.39:3-21 (motorcycle registration fee); R.S.39:10-11 (motor vehicle certificate of ownership fees); R.S.39:10-12 (duplicate certificate of ownership fee); R.S.39:10-14 (fees for lien or change of title search); and R.S.39:10-16 (fee for corrected certificate of ownership).  The bill amends existing law to set by statute the amount of certain boating certificate of ownership fees rather than to let the fees be established by regulation.  The fees are established at the current rates.  The bill also rescinds or requires the rescinding of any regulations increasing the above mentioned fees adopted by the board of the commission before the date this bill becomes law.  This bill is in response to a rule proposal (41 N.J.R.862(a)) by the Motor Vehicle Commission to adopt regulations to increase fees in the above-mentioned areas.  Of particular concern is the proposal to increase the fee for motorcycle registration from $10 to $65 (a more than 600% increase) and the fee for motor vehicle and boat certificates of ownership from $20 to $60 (a 300% increase).
