(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall take effect on the first day of the sixth month next following the date of enactment.

To determine whether a rent increase is unconscionable, a court would consider: § the amount of the proposed rent increase; § the landlords expenses and profitability, including, but not limited to, the consideration of: o   new ownership or refinancing of the rental unit; o   new or preexisting financing on the property; o   improvements and maintenance to the rental unit or rental building or buildings; and o   changes in expenses related to the property, such as utilities, provided the utilities are paid for by the landlord, and insurance rate increases, which are approved by the relevant rate setter over the previous 12 months; § how the existing and proposed rents compare to rents charged at similar rental properties in the geographic area; § the relative bargaining position of the parties, including but not limited to, consideration of the availability of rental housing in the geographic area; § based on the judges general knowledge, whether the rent increase would shock the conscience of a reasonable person; § the length of time since the last rent increase by the current owner against the residential tenant, the length of tenancy, and the length of property ownership; and § the condition of the property, including whether there are claims related to the habitability of the premises and outstanding code violations affecting health and safety, which remain unaddressed following written notice to the landlord and an opportunity to cure. The bill also provides that any court records concerning an eviction action brought by a residential landlord against a residential tenant pursuant to subsection f. of section 2 of P.L.1974, c.49 (C.2A:18-61.1), where the tenant prevails, shall be excluded from public access, unless the landlord obtains a judgment for possession after a trial. The bill specifies that its provisions would not be applicable to rent increases that are subject to and compliant with a local rent control ordinance or approved variance, or subject to regulation by a local, State, or federal affordable housing program. The bill would take effect immediately, except that subsection e. of section 1 of the bill, concerning the confidentiality of certain court records related to an eviction, would take effect on the first day of the sixth month next following the date of enactment.
