A1849 ASSEMBLY, No. 1849 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  ROBERT J. KARABINCHAK District 18 (Middlesex) Assemblywoman  SHAMA A. HAIDER District 37 (Bergen) SYNOPSIS Directs installation of hydrogen refueling stations at service areas on States toll roads. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning hydrogen refueling stations, and supplementing P.L.1948, c.454 (C.27:23-1 et seq.) and P.L.1991, c.252 (C.27:25A-1 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  As used in this section: Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle means a motor vehicle that is propelled by power derived from one or more cells that convert chemical energy directly into electricity by combining oxygen with hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen refueling station means a motor vehicle fueling station that provides hydrogen fuel, either exclusively or concurrently with other motor vehicle fuels, for use by hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. b.    Notwithstanding any law or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto to the contrary, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority shall provide, within two years after the effective date of this act, that each New Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway service area shall be equipped with at least one hydrogen refueling station. c.     The authority shall determine the costs to the authority associated with the installation and operation of the hydrogen refueling stations, and shall recover such costs from motorists who use the stations, in proportion to their use. 2.    a.  As used in this section: Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle means a motor vehicle that is propelled by power derived from one or more cells that convert chemical energy directly into electricity by combining oxygen with hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen refueling station means a motor vehicle fueling station that provides hydrogen fuel, either exclusively or concurrently with other motor vehicle fuels, for use by hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. b.    Notwithstanding any law or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto to the contrary, the South Jersey Transportation Authority shall provide, within two years after the effective date of this act, that each Atlantic City Expressway service area shall be equipped with at least one hydrogen refueling station. c.     The authority shall determine the costs to the authority associated with the installation and operation of the hydrogen refueling stations, and shall recover such costs from motorists who use the stations, in proportion to their use. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill directs the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and the South Jersey Transportation Authority to equip service areas along the toll roads under their jurisdictions with hydrogen refueling stations that would fuel hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.  The authorities are directed to recover costs associated with the refueling stations from motorists who use the stations, in proportion to the motorists use. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are electrically powered and they produce only water vapor as an emission. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles typically have a longer range than battery-powered electric vehicles and they can be refueled in approximately the same time and manner as a gasoline-powered vehicle.  This bill would encourage New Jersey residents to purchase hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by ensuring that there are facilities available to refuel them.
