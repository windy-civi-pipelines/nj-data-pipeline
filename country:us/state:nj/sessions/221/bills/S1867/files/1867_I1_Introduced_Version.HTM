STATEMENT This bill authorizes the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (commission) to issue special Second Amendment license plates. The bill provides that the design of the Second Amendment license plate is to display a militiaman along with the words Protect the Second Amendment at the bottom of the license plate.  In consultation with the Fish and Game Council (council), the chief administrator will select the design and color scheme of the Second Amendment license plates. In addition to all fees otherwise required by law for the registration of a motor vehicle, there is an application fee of $50 and an annual renewal fee of $10 for the Second Amendment license plates.  After deducting the cost of designing, producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the plates and of any computer programming changes that are necessary to implement the license plate program, additional fees will be deposited into a special non-lapsing fund known as the Second Amendment License Plate Fund.  The proceeds of the fund will be annually appropriated to the council and will be used to provide funding to support State-owned gun ranges. The chief administrator is required to annually certify the average cost of producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the availability of the specialty license plates. If the average cost per plate exceeds $50 in two consecutive fiscal years, the chief administrator may discontinue the license plate program.  The bill also requires the council to appoint a liaison to represent the council in all communications with the commission regarding the Second Amendment license plates. The bill prohibits the commission from using State or other public funds to cover the initial cost of implementing the Second Amendment license plate program.  The bill requires an individual or entity designated by the council to contribute non-public monies, not to exceed $25,000, to offset the initial costs to design, produce, issue, and publicize the license plates and for computer programming changes that may be necessary to implement the program.  The bill authorizes the council to receive funds from private sources to offset the initial costs. The commission is not required to design, produce, issue, or publicize the availability of the license plates until: (1) the individual or entity designated by the council has provided the commission with the money necessary to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission in establishing the license plate program; and (2) the council liaison has provided the commission with a minimum of 500 completed applications for the license plates. The provisions of the bill will remain inoperative until the first day of the 13th month after the appropriate applications and fees required to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission are provided to the commission.  The bill expires on the last day of the 12th month after enactment if sufficient applications and fees to offset the initial costs are not received by that date.
