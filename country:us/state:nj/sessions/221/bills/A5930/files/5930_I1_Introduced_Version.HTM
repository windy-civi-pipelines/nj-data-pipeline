the Commissioner of Education, one or more of the following reasons:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.      the proposed teaching
hours at the nonpublic school conflict with the teacher's public school work

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2. a. There is established in
the Department of Education a grant program in which an eligible teacher
employed <u>or previously employed</u> by a school district may receive additional
remuneration to teach science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM)
classes<u>, or other STEM subject or area</u> at a nonpublic school.  Under the
program, participating nonpublic schools shall form partnerships with eligible
teachers and school districts, in which an eligible teacher employed <u>or
previously employed</u> by the district teaches STEM classes at the nonpublic
school at such times and during such hours mutually agreed upon by the teacher,
nonpublic school, and school district, which may include hours beyond regular
public school day hours such as extended day, evening, or weekend programming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The purposes of the
grant program shall be to: incentivize current <u>and retired</u> teachers to
obtain the necessary qualifications to teach STEM subjects; incentivize
individuals to enter the teaching profession to fill the demand for qualified
educators in STEM subjects; assist in addressing the difficulties public and
nonpublic schools face in attracting qualified educators in the STEM fields;
and improve Statewide access to education in the STEM fields to address the
workforce demands of New Jersey's economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A school district
annually shall notify all teachers employed by the district<u>, as well as
individuals who are retired but previously employed by the district,</u> of the
grant program, and shall submit a list of all eligible teachers that express an
interest in participating in the program to the executive county superintendent
by January 15 of each year.  The executive county superintendent shall share
the lists with nonpublic schools upon request.</p>

participating nonpublic school determines that a participating eligible teacher
is not in compliance with the program or is violating the nonpublic school's
code of conduct, the nonpublic school may submit information to the
commissioner supporting its determination, and request that the teacher be
removed from participation in the program at the nonpublic school.  The
information submitted shall demonstrate noncompliance with the program, the
nonpublic school's code of conduct, or the nonpublic school's faculty
handbook.  After reviewing the information, the commissioner may terminate the
teacher's participation in the program at that nonpublic school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics teacher (STEM) grant program to
include retired teachers under the program.  The bill also authorizes the
inclusion of active or retired teachers who may teach some other STEM subject
or area, and the payment of grant funds directly to the eligible teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In 2019, the Legislature established
a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics teacher STEM grant program,
P.L 2019, c.256 (C.18A:6-137 et seq.).  Under the program, participating
nonpublic schools form partnerships with eligible teachers and school districts,
in which an eligible teacher employed by the district teaches STEM classes at
the nonpublic school.  The Commissioner of Education awards grants to participating
school districts to provide compensation to participating teachers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill allows a STEM
teacher who was previously employed by the school district to teach STEM, but
is now retired and receiving a retirement allowance under the Teachers Pension
and Annuity Fund, to qualify as an eligible teacher under the program, and
establishes a formula for the calculation of a retired teachers remuneration. 
The bill also authorizes a currently employed or retired teacher who teaches or
taught a STEM subject or area other than science, technology, engineering,
mathematics, or computer science to participate in the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
grant funds for the payment of an eligible teachers salary will be forwarded
by the Department of Education directly to the eligible teacher rather than
through the school district.  The bill authorizes the Commissioner of Education
to contract with a third party to administer grant fund payments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill appropriates
$3.5 million for the program.</p>
