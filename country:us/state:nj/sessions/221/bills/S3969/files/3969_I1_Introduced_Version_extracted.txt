Notwithstanding the termination of the financial review board and supervision, all memorandums of understanding entered into by the municipality as a condition of receiving assistance under P.L.1987, c.75 (C.52:27D-118.24 et seq.) that require the municipality to implement any government, administrative, operational efficiency or oversight measures necessary for the fiscal recovery of the municipality as recommended by the director and approved by the Local Finance Board shall continue to have full force and effect. During the rehabilitation term, the chief operating officer shall be responsible for entering into any memorandum of understanding on behalf of the qualified municipality that is required as a condition of receiving assistance under P.L.1987, c.75 (C.52:27D-118.24 et seq.), or any other law; provided, however, that those memoranda of understanding shall be consistent with the provisions of P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.) and P.L.2007, c.176 (C.52:27BBB-2.2 et al.), and the powers of the chief operating officer granted pursuant thereto.  Any such memoranda of understanding shall be executed between the chief operating officer and the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.  Whenever the powers and duties of the chief operating officer have devolved upon the director pursuant to subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-7), the memorandum of understanding shall be executed between the director, on behalf of the qualified municipality, and the State Treasurer, on behalf of the State. (cf: P.L.2021, c.30, s.2.) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would extend the economic recovery term under the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act," P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.) (MRERA), by five years.  This would extend the special governing procedures, economic benefits, and additional oversight measures provided for a qualified municipality under the MRERA.  Based upon the continuing unique fiscal distress facing the City of Camden, it is evident that a longer economic recovery term is necessary to achieving the fiscal stability and economic revitalization goals of the MRERA.
