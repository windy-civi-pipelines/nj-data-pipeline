This bill provides that an inmate who identifies as transgender is required to be assigned to a State correctional facility based on the inmates gender identity or expression, regardless of the gender that the individual was assigned at birth or the inmates anatomical characteristics.  An inmate who is non-binary is to be assigned to a facility based on the inmates stated preference.
