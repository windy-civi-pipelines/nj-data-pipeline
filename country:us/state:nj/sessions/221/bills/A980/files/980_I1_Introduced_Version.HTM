<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.   (1)     A business,
upon application to and approval from the authority, shall be allowed a credit
of 100 percent of its capital investment, made after the effective date of
P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) but prior to its submission of
documentation pursuant to subsection c. of this section, in a qualified
business facility within an eligible municipality, pursuant to the restrictions
and requirements of this section.  To be eligible for any tax credits
authorized under this section, a business shall demonstrate to the authority,
at the time of application, that the State's financial support of the proposed
capital investment in a qualified business facility will yield a net positive
benefit to both the State and the eligible municipality.  The value of all
credits approved by the authority pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et
seq.) shall not exceed $1,750,000,000, except as may be increased by the

P.L.2009,&nbsp;c.90 (C.34:1B-209.3) and section 6 of P.L.2010, c.57
(C.34:1B-209.4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A business, other than a
tenant eligible pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, shall make or
acquire capital investments totaling not less than $50,000,000 in a qualified
business facility, at which the business shall employ not fewer than 250
full-time employees to be eligible for a credit under this section.  A business
that acquires a qualified business facility shall also be deemed to have
acquired the capital investment made or acquired by the seller.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   A business that is a
tenant in a qualified business facility, the owner of which has made or
acquired capital investments in the facility totaling not less than
$50,000,000, shall occupy a leased area of the qualified business facility that
represents at least $17,500,000 of the capital investment in the facility at
which the tenant business and up to two other tenants in the qualified business
facility shall employ not fewer than 250 full-time employees in the aggregate
to be eligible for a credit under this section.  The amount of capital
investment in a facility that a leased area represents shall be equal to that
percentage of the owner's total capital investment in the facility that the
percentage of net leasable area leased by the tenant is of the total net
leasable area of the qualified business facility.  Capital investments made by
a tenant shall be deemed to be included in the calculation of the capital
investment made or acquired by the owner, but only to the extent necessary to
meet the owner's minimum capital investment of $50,000,000.  Capital
investments made by a tenant and not allocated to meet the owner's minimum
capital investment threshold of $50,000,000 shall be added to the amount of
capital investment represented by the tenant's leased area in the qualified
business facility.</p>

the business for this credit, or if the business receives assistance pursuant
to P.L.1996, c.25 (C.34:1B-112 et seq.).  A business that is allowed a tax
credit under this section shall not be eligible for incentives authorized
pursuant to P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.).  A business shall not qualify
for a tax credit under this section, based upon its capital investment and the
employment of full-time employees, if that capital investment or employment was
the basis for which a grant was provided to the business pursuant to the

of the total net leasable area of the qualified business facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   A business shall be

effective date of P.L.2011, c.89 but prior to its submission of documentation
pursuant to subsection c. of this section, in a qualified business facility
that is part of a mixed use project, provided that (a) the qualified business
facility represents at least $17,500,000 of the total capital investment in the
mixed use project, (b) the business employs not fewer than 250 full-time
employees in the qualified business facility, and (c) the total capital
investment in the mixed use project of which the qualified business facility is
a part is not less than $50,000,000.  The allowance of credits under this
paragraph shall be subject to the restrictions and requirements, to the extent
that those are not inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph, set
forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this subsection, including, but not
limited to, the requirement that the business shall demonstrate to the
authority, at the time of application, that the State's financial support of
the proposed capital investment in a qualified business facility will yield a
net positive benefit to both the State and the eligible municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   In determining whether a
proposed capital investment will yield a net positive benefit, the authority
shall not consider the transfer of an existing job from one location in the
State to another location in the State as the creation of a new job, unless (a)
the business proposes to transfer existing jobs to a municipality in the State
as part of a consolidation of business operations from two or more other
locations that are not in the same municipality whether in-State or
out-of-State, or (b) the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent
officer, submits a certification to the authority indicating that the existing
jobs are at risk of leaving the State and that the business's chief executive
officer, or equivalent officer, has reviewed the information submitted to the
authority and that the representations contained therein are accurate, and the business
intends to employ not fewer than 500 full-time employees in the qualified
business facility.  In the event that this certification by the business's
chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, is found to be willfully false,
the authority may revoke any award of tax credits in their entirety, which
revocation shall be in addition to any other criminal or civil penalties that
the business and the officer may be subject to.  When considering an
application involving intra-State job transfers, the authority shall require
the company to submit the following information as part of its application: a
full economic analysis of all locations under consideration by the company; all
lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation
for the business's current in-State locations; and all lease agreements,
ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the potential
out-of-State location alternatives, to the extent they exist.  Based on this
information, and any other information deemed relevant by the authority, the
authority shall independently verify and confirm, by way of making a factual
finding by separate vote of the authority's board, the business's assertion
that the jobs are actually at risk of leaving the State, before a business may
be awarded any tax credits under this section.</p>

financial authorization for the award of a tax credit, the authority is

eligible applicants, provided that the authority shall take final action on
those applications no later than December 31, 2013.</p>

number of full-time employees required for eligibility under the program may be
employed by any number of tenants or other occupants of the facility, in the
aggregate, and the initial satisfaction of the requirement following completion
of the project shall be deemed to satisfy the employment requirements of the
program in all respects, and (b) if the capital investment in the facility
exceeds $100,000,000, the determination of the net positive benefit yield shall

pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) in any fiscal year shall not

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill expands eligibility
under the Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit Act (UTHTCA) by broadening certain
municipal qualifier provisions.  During the 2006-2007 Session the Legislature
passed UTHTCA as a mechanism to catalyze economic development.  As originally
enacted, UTHTCA provided tax credits for qualified business facilities within
urban transit hubs located in municipalities meeting certain criteria.  This
bill amends the municipal qualifier provisions so that any municipality with a
commuter rail station satisfies the requirements to be considered an eligible
municipality.  The intent behind broadening the definition of eligible
municipality is to expand the scope wherein the tax credit can induce economic
development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under UTHTCA, a business that
makes $50,000,000 of capital investment in a qualified business facility within
an urban transit hub and that employs at least 250 people at the facility may
qualify for a tax credit equal to the qualified capital investment.  The credit
may be applied against corporation business tax, insurance premiums tax or
gross income tax liability.  UTHTCA also enables a tenant located in a
qualified business facility to take advantage of a similar credit, under
certain circumstances and limitations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For a business facility to
qualify under UTHTCA, it must be located in a urban rail transit hub that is
within a municipality that is eligible for urban aid and has at least 30
percent of its real property value exempt from property taxes.  According to
the New Jersey Office of Economic Growth, as UTHTCA was originally enacted nine
municipalities would meet that criteria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     By broadening the municipal
qualifier provisions to include any municipality with a commuter rail station,
this bill is designed to widen the scope of tax credit eligibility to encourage
economic development in and beyond nine municipalities.  Accordingly, this bill
also removes the word urban from the title of the UTHTCA so that it is read
as the Transit Hub Tax Credit Act.  </p>
