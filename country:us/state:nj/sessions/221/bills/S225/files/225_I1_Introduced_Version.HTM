<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning energy storage systems and
supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The electric grid is
evolving from a system that relies on one-way, long-distance transmission of
electricity from centralized power plants to customers  to a system that includes
local energy sources located close to customers, who increasingly both produce
and consume electricity;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Energy storage systems, located
throughout the electric grid, can facilitate greater energy independence and
energy security for the States electric customers by providing increased
stability of the power supply, smoother integration of renewable energy
sources, a reduction in the peak demand placed on centralized power plants, and
cost savings;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Locating energy sources
and energy storage systems in high value locations, often near the point of
consumption, enhances grid stability and increases efficiency;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Empowering New Jerseyans
to take a more active role in the States electric grid would leverage private
capital, protect customers from rising energy costs, and promote greater
understanding and engagement with the challenges associated with updating the
States electric grid;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Front-of-the-meter
energy storage systems that are interconnected with the transmission and
distribution system offer distinctive advantages, including, but not limited
to, lower costs and responsiveness to price signals from the wholesale
electricity market or electric public utility;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><sup><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>      </span></sup></b>f.     There are
currently significant barriers that disincline New Jersey electric customers
from obtaining the benefits of  energy storage systems, including inadequate
valuation of energy storage; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    It is fitting, proper,
and in the public interest to encourage the installation of energy storage
systems by providing monetary incentives to new energy storage systems and  renewable
energy sources paired with energy storage systems, and to compensate front-of-the-meter
energy storage systems for their value to the grid, until these barriers are
removed by market forces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All-in system cost means the
total cost of purchasing and installing a new energy storage system, including the
costs of hardware, siting, installation, permitting, and interconnection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Board means the Board of
Public Utilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Customer-sited energy storage
system means an energy storage system that operates in parallel with an
electric distribution system, is connected on the customer side of the meter,
and is owned by the customer or another party that is not the electric public
utility that provides electric power to the customer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Electric public utility
means a public utility, as that term is defined in R.S.48:2-13, that transmits
and distributes electricity to end users within the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Energy storage system means
a commercially available technology that is capable of absorbing energy,
storing such energy for a period of time, and redelivering the energy after it
has been stored to provide direct or indirect benefits to the broader
electricity system, including, but not limited to, a battery system, pumped
hydroelectric system, compressed air system, flywheel, or a hydrogen
production, storage, or fuel cell system, provided that the hydrogen is
produced through electrolysis using electricity from a renewable source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Front-of-the-meter energy
storage system means an energy storage system that is interconnected  with the
transmission and distribution system on the utility side of the meter.  Front-of-the-meter
energy storage system shall include an energy storage system that is subject
to a tariff from an electric public utility or from PJM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Gap analysis means an
analysis that determines the difference between the average all-in system costs
of energy storage systems, considering each energy storage technology and
application, and the prevailing revenue stream opportunities to support the
economics of the energy storage systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Overburdened community means
the same as the term is defined in section 2 of P.L.2020, c.92 (C.13:1D-158).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Performance incentive means
a series of recurring monetary payments paid by an electric public utility to
an owner of an energy storage system who participates in the pilot program to
compensate for the benefits to the transmission and distribution system
provided by the system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Pilot program means the
pilot program to incentivize the installation of new energy storage systems in
the State developed by the board pursuant to section 3 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.
or PJM means the same as the term is defined in section 3 of P.L.1999, c.23
(C.48:3-51).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      Transmission and
distribution system means the same as the term is defined in section 3 of
P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-51).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upfront incentive means a
one-time monetary payment from the board to an owner of an energy storage
system who participates in the pilot program to mitigate the upfront costs of
the system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  No later than 90 days after
the effective date of this act, the board shall initiate a proceeding to
develop a pilot program to incentivize the installation of new energy storage
systems in the State.  The pilot program shall include an upfront incentive as
set forth in section 4 of this act and a performance incentive as set forth in
section 5 of this act for owners of energy storage systems that are approved by
the board to participate in the program.  The provisions of the pilot program
shall be based upon the best available data from similarly designed programs in
other states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At the completion of the
proceeding or 180 days after the effective date of this act, whichever occurs
sooner, the board shall issue a board order establishing the pilot program. 
The order shall include: the incentive amounts established for customer-sited
energy storage systems and front-of-the-meter energy storage systems  pursuant
to sections 4 and 5 of this act; a methodology for determining compensation
amounts for tariffs filed for front-of-the-meter energy storage systems not
subject to a tariff from PJM<u> </u>pursuant to section 6 of this act; and an
application process for persons who wish to participate in the pilot program. 
The upfront incentive amounts shall be based on the nameplate storage capacity
of the energy storage system, as measured in kilowatt hours of alternating
current power output.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Stand-alone energy
storage systems or energy storage systems that are paired with a  renewable
source of electric power, including, but not limited to, a solar photovoltaic
array, shall be eligible for the program.  However, the pilot program shall be
available only to an energy storage system that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   becomes operable on or
after the date of the pilot programs establishment; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   is either:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   a customer-sited energy
storage system that is owned, leased, or operated by a residential or
non-residential customer of an electric public utility; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   a  front-of-the-meter
energy storage system located in the service area of an electric public
utility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The board shall reserve
at least one third of the upfront incentives provided to customer-sited energy
storage systems for customer classes or deployment scenarios that face greater
economic hurdles, including, but not limited to, low-to-moderate income
customers and customers sited in overburdened communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    In the course of
developing the pilot program, the board shall consider revising the eligibility
requirement for net-metering for solar energy systems that requires that the
capacity of the solar energy system be no greater than the annualized
electricity usage of the facility to which the solar energy system supplies
electricity, in order to accommodate the inclusion of energy storage system
capacity, as well as the potential for future electric vehicle capacity.  The
board shall include its recommendation in the report required by section 7 of
this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The pilot program shall
be designed to achieve or exceed, together with other programs established by
the board, the energy storage goals established by subsection d. of section 1  of
P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The program shall not
prevent energy storage systems from providing services to, or participating in,
the wholesale market.  Any evaluation of costs and benefits of energy storage
systems shall include benefits that accrue directly or indirectly to ratepayers
due to the participation of the energy storage systems in wholesale markets. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The pilot program shall
be closed immediately upon the adoption of the rules and regulations required
pursuant to section 8 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  a.  The pilot program
shall include an upfront incentive for the owner of a customer-sited energy
storage system or front-of-the-meter energy storage system, which shall be
based on the installed capacity of the energy storage system and provided in
dollars per kilowatt-hour  and shall not exceed 40 percent of the projects
all-in cost.  When determining the amount of the upfront incentive offered to
an energy storage system, the board shall perform a gap analysis to ensure that
the incentive to the owner incorporates consideration of the difference between
available revenue streams, including any performance incentive offered under
the pilot program, and the all-in system costs of the energy storage system. 
The board may develop a system of incentive bonuses to differentiate between
projects by attributes, including, but not limited to, those serving low- and
middle-income communities.  After the expiration of the pilot program, the
board may reduce or eliminate the upfront incentive commensurate with a
Statewide reduction in all-in system costs for energy storage systems or an
increase in revenue streams available to owners of energy storage systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The board shall
establish qualifications and requirements an applicant shall be required to
meet in order to be eligible for an upfront incentive pursuant to this section,
which may be more stringent than the requirements of subsection b. of section 3
of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     For energy storage systems
with 25 kilowatts of nameplate storage capacity or greater, the board shall
require the applicant for an upfront incentive to pay to the board a refundable
deposit, which shall be refunded once the energy storage system is determined
by the board to be operable and in use.  The board shall develop a formula for
calculating the deposit amount, in which the amount of the deposit is
proportional to the nameplate capacity of the energy storage system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.     (1)  The board shall
require an applicant for an upfront incentive to complete the energy storage
project:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) for customer-sited energy
storage systems, no later than 18 months after the date the board approves the
applicants application; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) for front-of-the-meter
energy storage systems, no later than 40 months after the date the board
approves the applicants application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      (2)  An applicant that does
not comply with the project timeline requirements of this subsection shall not
be refunded the deposit paid to the board pursuant to subsection c. of this
section.  The deposit shall be transferred by the board to the General Fund. 
The board may waive or extend the project timeline requirements established by
this subsection for an applicant that demonstrates extenuating circumstances
that caused a delay in the completion of the energy storage project, including
any delays caused by an electric public utility or PJM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The board shall limit
upfront incentives to one award per electric meter, for customer-sited energy
storage systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The board shall
allocate at least $60 million per year, for the duration of the pilot program,
from moneys collected from the societal benefits charge imposed pursuant to
section 12 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-60) to fund upfront incentives pursuant to
this section.  After the expiration of the pilot program, the board may
determine the appropriate amount of funds to allocate to upfront incentives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.  a.  The pilot program
shall include a performance incentive to compensate the owner of  a
customer-sited energy storage system  or front-of-the-meter energy storage
system.  The purpose of the performance payment shall be to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   provide fair
compensation for the full value of services provided by the energy storage
system, including improving the efficiency of the transmission and distribution
system and reducing the peak demand placed on electricity generators;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   increase the number of
cost-effective energy storage systems that are connected to the transmission

of the transmission and distribution systems through the deployment of back-up
power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The board shall require
each electric public utility in the State to offer an appropriate performance
incentive, for a period to be determined by the board, to an owner of an energy
storage system that participates in the program, which compensates for the
operational attributes of the system, including, but not limited to, capacity,
demand response, load shifting, generation shifting, locational value, and
voltage support.  The costs of the performance incentives shall be apportioned
to ratepayers using a methodology approved by the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The board shall
establish qualifications and requirements an applicant shall be required to
meet in order to be eligible for a performance incentive pursuant to this
