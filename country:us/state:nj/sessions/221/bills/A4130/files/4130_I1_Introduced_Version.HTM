President of the United States or the United States Secretary of Defense
designates as the termination date of that operation; provided, that any person
receiving an actual service-incurred injury or disability while engaged in such
service shall be classed as a veteran whether or not that person has completed
the 14 days' service as herein provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill expands the
definition of a child under the PFRS and SPRS to include the child of a
deceased member that is under the age of 24 and that is enrolled in a degree
program in an institution of higher education for at least 12 credit hours in
each semester.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a person is
considered a child under the PFRS and SPRS if the person is:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) under the age of 18;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) 18 years of age or older
and enrolled in a secondary school;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) under the age of 24 and
enrolled in a degree program in an institution of higher education for at least
12 credit hours in each semester, provided that the member died in active
service as a result of an accident met in the actual performance of duty at
some definite time and place, and the death was not the result of the member's
willful misconduct; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) any age who, at the time
of the member's or retirant's death, is disabled because of an intellectual
disability or physical incapacity, is unable to do any substantial, gainful
work because of the impairment and the impairment has lasted or can be expected
to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, as affirmed by the
medical board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would remove the
requirement that if the child is under the age of 24 and enrolled in an
institution of higher education, the child must be the survivor of a member who
died in the line of duty to be considered a child under the PFRS or SPRS.  This
bill would permit any child of a deceased member that is under the age of 24
and that is enrolled in a degree program in an institution of higher education
for at least 12 credit hours in each semester to be considered a child regardless
if the member died in the line of duty or not.</p>
