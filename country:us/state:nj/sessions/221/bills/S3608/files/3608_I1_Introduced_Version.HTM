The director would not approve or deny an application until receipt of an endorsement or approval by the appropriate governing body officials. The holder of a temporary expansion permit issued by the ABC director prior to the bills enactment would be entitled to convert that temporary permit into a permanent permit issued under the bill. In addition, the bill requires owners and operators of those establishments seeking to utilize outdoor spaces or public sidewalks as extensions of their business premises to file an application with the municipal zoning officer, including information concerning the use of the outdoor spaces or public sidewalks, as appropriate, pursuant to the requirements provided in the bill. The installation and continuous use of tents, canopies, umbrellas, tables, chairs, and other fixtures on private property or public property or right of way designated by a municipality are to be a permitted use provided that the tent, canopy, umbrella, table, chairs, or other fixture conforms to all applicable provisions of the State Uniform Construction Code and Uniform Fire Code. The bill provides that all other municipal ordinances pertaining to sanitation, property maintenance, noise, business days and hours of operation, and days and hours of service of alcoholic beverages are to apply, unless specifically suspended or modified by the municipality or specifically prohibited by the provisions of the bill. With respect to a restaurant, bar, distillery, or brewery operating in outdoor spaces, a municipality is not to prohibit or limit the days and hours of the outdoor service of food and beverages, including alcoholic beverages, except that municipalities may prohibit or limit operations for the hours after 10:00 p.m. and between 12:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. on Sundays through Wednesdays, and between 12:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. on Thursdays through Saturdays, with the exception that a municipal ordinance prohibiting or limiting the days and hours of indoor service of food and beverages, including alcoholic beverages, may be applied to the outdoor service of food and beverages, including alcoholic beverages, as a condition of the zoning approval pursuant to the bill.  This provision shall not be construed as overruling or prohibiting the authority of a city of the first class to impose more restrictive time restrictions or prohibit or limit the days and hours of the outdoor service of food and beverages. The bill provides that a municipality may either prohibit or limit the days and hours of any live performances, including musical performances, and the playing or projection of any content from a recording, streaming service or television, cable, or Internet broadcasting service in outdoor spaces or on public sidewalks as a condition of the zoning approval. Nothing in the bill is to be interpreted or construed as permitting or mandating the opening, expansion, or resumption of unlimited operations of a restaurant, bar, or brewery that is closed, whether permanently or temporarily, or operating subject to limitations on its operations, service, or hours, as a result of disciplinary or legal sanctions imposed by, or entering into a settlement agreement with, a court of the State of New Jersey, a municipal court, the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, or a municipal governing body acting as a local alcoholic beverage control board, as applicable.  Further, nothing in the bill permits the use of State-owned rights-of-way for the purposes of outdoor dining.  A permit for the use of the State rights-of-way is to be issued upon application and approval of the New Jersey Department of Transportation.  For the purposes of locally-owned roads that intersect the State highway system, setbacks from the State right-of-way line will be 50 feet from April 1 to October 31, and 100 feet from November 1 to March 31. Under the bill, a permit issued to a restaurant, bar, distillery, or brewery with an alcoholic beverage retail license issued by the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control in the Department of Law and Public Safety is to renew with that license, provided the legal entity holding the license has not changed.  A permit issued to a restaurant without an alcoholic beverage retail license is to renew annually.
