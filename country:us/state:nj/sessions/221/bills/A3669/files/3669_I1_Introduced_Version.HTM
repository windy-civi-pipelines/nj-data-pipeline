Additionally, the bill allows a patient with a membership or an account in a healthcare platform to apply the membership or account towards payment of services provided as a result of telehealth or telemedicine.  The patient is to notify a provider of any identification number, if given, in connection with the membership or account with a healthcare platform to ensure the preservation of a proper patient-provider relationship.

(cf: P.L.2003, c.280, s.26) 4.    (New section) A patient with a membership or account with a healthcare platform may apply the membership or account as part of the payment for a prescription or non-prescription drug or device. 5.    (New section) A patient with a membership or an account with a healthcare platform, as defined pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2003, c.280 (C.45:14-41), may apply the membership or account towards payment of services provided as a result of telehealth or telemedicine.  A patient who uses or intends to use a membership or an account with a healthcare platform to pay for telehealth or telemedicine services shall notify a provider of any identification number, if given, in connection with the membership or account with a healthcare platform to ensure the preservation of a proper patient-provider relationship pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-63). 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill incorporates the use of healthcare platforms such as GoodRx and SingleCare into the laws governing pharmacy benefits managers, pharmacists and telehealth.  Healthcare platform is defined in the bill as an Internet-based service through which a consumer, who may or may not have separate health insurance coverage, may set-up an account or become a member to obtain discounts on prescription or non-prescription drugs or devices and through which other services, including telemedicine, may be provided.  The bill authorizes patients to use a membership or an account with a healthcare platform and to stipulate that a licensee of the Board of Pharmacy will not be penalized for allowing a patient to use a discount from a healthcare platform as part of payment.  The bill also stipulates that a pharmacy benefits manager is to not prohibit or apply any penalty or disincentive to a network pharmacy if a discounted price generated by a healthcare platform is applied to the payment made by a covered person with an account or membership to the healthcare platform for a prescription drug even if the covered person maintains health insurance coverage. Additionally, the bill allows a patient with a membership or an account in a healthcare platform to apply the membership or account towards payment of services provided as a result of telehealth or telemedicine.  The patient is to notify a provider of any identification number, if given, in connection with the membership or account with a healthcare platform to ensure the preservation of a proper patient-provider relationship.
