<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend and
supplement the States Prescribed Burn Act, P.L.2018, c.107 (C.13:9-44.11 et
seq.), in order to clarify the goals, requirements, and timeframes that are
applicable to prescribed burn planning and the undertaking of prescribed burns across
the State.  A prescribed burn occurs when there is a deliberate ignition and
controlled open burning of wildland fire fuels to attain resource management
objectives, such as public safety, wildfire control, ecological, silvicultural,
agricultural, or other natural resource management goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under existing law, a
prescribed burn may be conducted by the State, the federal government, or a
landowner or lessee, in accordance with a prescribed burn plan adopted thereby
and approved by the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to the
Prescribed Burn Act, P.L.2018, c.107 (C.13:9-44.11 et seq.).  Although the
Prescribed Burn Act, when enacted in 2018, provided for the department to
establish and administer a prescribed burn program to facilitate the safe and
proper undertaking of prescribed burns in the State, that law did not specify
the timeframe within which such program should be commenced.  Accordingly, this
bill would amend the Prescribed Burn Act to expressly require the department to
develop and adopt rules and regulations relevant to prescribed burns, and to
establish and commence the administration of its prescribed burn program,
within 18 months after the date of this bills enactment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would further clarify
that the prescribed burn program is to provide for authorized persons to
utilize fire, as a tool, for the management of the State's forests, based upon
sound science, and is to incorporate, at a minimum:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   best practices to ensure
the safe and effective use of prescribed burning, as a tool, for such purposes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   requirements providing
for the development and implementation of a prescribed burn plan for each
appropriate parcel of forested land owned by the State, with priority being
given to those State-owned lands that are located in those areas of the State
which are determined, by the Forest Fire Service, to be most in danger of
wildfire due to the accumulation of wildland fire fuels; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   a process to identify,
and to periodically report to the Governor and the Legislature on, any legal
barriers that may serve to hinder the prompt or effective development of
prescribed burn plans or undertaking of prescribed burn operations in
accordance therewith, particularly in those areas of the State which are
determined by the Forest Fire Service to be most in danger of wildfire due to
the accumulation of wildland fire fuels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Because the State Forest Fire
Service generally provides for prescribed burns to be conducted during the late
winter months, both in order to reduce the amount of smoke produced and in
order take advantage of more predictable weather conditions, as necessary to
ensure safer and more controlled fires, this bill would require all prescribed
burns to be undertaken between the months of November and March, prior to the
start of prime wildfire season in New Jersey, which typically occurs during the
months of April and May.  The department would be required, under the bill, to
annually establish a Statewide goal of conducting prescribed burns on a minimum
of 50,000 acres in the pinelands area, and on an additional 10,000 acres
elsewhere in the State, and the bill would additionally require relevant State
agencies, which are involved in environmental planning and land use management,
to incorporate these annual Statewide prescribed burn goals into all relevant
environmental plans, programs, and surveys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would further require
the department, acting through its Forest Fire Service, to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   establish and annually
operate a prescribed burn training program that is to provide private
landowners, local fire officials, other appropriate government officials, and
relevant non-profit operators, employees, and volunteers, with educational

private landowners, by local fire officials and other appropriate government
officials, and by relevant non-profit operators, employees, and volunteers,
throughout the State; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   annually deploy, between
the months of November and March prior to each years peak fire season, the
Mobile Prescribed Burn Units, established pursuant to the bill, to those areas
of the State which are determined by the Forest Fire Service to be most in
danger of wildfire due to the accumulation of wildland fire fuels, and require
such mobile units to:  a) provide private landowners, local fire officials,
other appropriate government officials, and relevant non-profit operators, employees,
and volunteers, in such fire-prone areas, with training and other relevant
information on prescribed burn best practices and on the special concerns or
considerations, if any, that are to be addressed when planning for, or
undertaking, prescribed burn operations in such areas; b) engage in the direct
monitoring and oversight of prescribed burn operations being undertaken in such
fire-prone areas; and c) provide other direct assistance, to relevant
individuals in such fire-prone areas, as may be necessary and appropriate to
facilitate and ensure the timely and effective development and prescribed burn
plans and the safe and effective undertaking of prescribed burn operations
therein; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   annually deploy, during
each years peak fire season, the Mobile Prescribed Burn Units established
pursuant to the bill, to those areas of the State which are determined by the
Forest Fire Service to be most in danger of wildfire due to the accumulation of
wildland fire fuels, and require such deployed mobile units to monitor ongoing wildfire
risk in those fire-prone areas and to otherwise evaluate the results and
effectiveness of the prescribed burn plans that have been implemented, and the prescribed
burn operations that have been undertaken, in such areas during the immediately
preceding prescribed burn period lasting from November to March.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would additionally require
the department to create and to publish, on its Internet website, a prescribed
burn schedule and calendar, identifying the dates and locations of all
prescribed burns that are planned in the State for the upcoming year.  Each
prescribed burn calendar would also be required to contain a hyperlink to an
electronic list or form, or would be required to provide another electronic
means, by which properly trained local fire officials can volunteer to
participate in the scheduled prescribed burn activities being undertaken across
the State.  A local fire official would be deemed to be properly trained, for
the bills purposes, so long as the official holds and submits, to the
department, a certification verifying the officials satisfactory completion of
a prescribed burn training course offered by the Forest Fire Service, pursuant
to the bills provisions, or a similar educational or training course approved
by the department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The department would similarly
be authorized, under the bill, to approve, for implementation, any prescribed
burn plan that is submitted thereto, provided that the person submitting such
plan also submits a certification verifying the persons successful completion
of prescribed burn training, either under the training program established and
operated by the Forest Fire Service, pursuant to the bill, or under a similar
educational or training program approved by the department.  However, the
submission of such training certification would not be required for plan
approval in any case where a person is seeking approval only to conduct a
prescribed burn on land for which the person is the landowner or lessee.</p>
