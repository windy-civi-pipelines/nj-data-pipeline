STATEMENT This bill requires the Department of Corrections to provide reunification therapy to inmates and members of their immediate family prior to the inmates release from incarceration. Under the bill, the Commissioner of Corrections is required to provide any inmate in this State who is scheduled to be released from incarceration within six months the opportunity to virtually participate in counseling sessions with members of the inmates immediate family.  The commissioner is required to advise an inmate who is scheduled to be released from incarceration within nine months that the inmate is entitled to participate in the counseling sessions. Upon the inmates request, the counseling sessions are to be conducted with the inmate participating virtually and the inmates immediate family members being physically present at one of the following locations: (1) the private office of a mental health care provider who is contracted by the Department of Corrections to provide mental health counseling under the bill; (2) a nonprofit inmate reentry service provider contracted by the Department of Community Affairs; or (3) any other location designated by the commissioner.  The commissioner is required to provide individual counseling sessions to an inmate who wishes to participate in the mental health counseling offered under the bill, but whose immediate family members decline to participate. Under the bill, the commissioner is required to establish public-private partnerships to effectuate the purposes of this bill among mental health care providers and nonprofit inmate reentry service providers.  The commissioner is further required to seek funding and other available resources from private nonprofit or for-profit sources or the federal government to effectuate the purposes of the bill, which are to be used to supplement, and not supplant, State funds used to carry out the purposes of the bill. In addition to any other requirements under current law related to providing information and services to inmates, the commissioner also is required to provide an inmate who participates in the counseling sessions with information concerning organizations and programs which provide assistance and services to inmates reentering society after a period of incarceration.  Finally, the bill requires funds to be appropriated from the general fund to the Department of Corrections in an amount necessary to implement the provisions of the bill. According to the sponsor, incarcerated parents face a unique set of challenges, which often require them to navigate both the child welfare and corrections systems.  Ninety-two percent of incarcerated parents in the United States are fathers, a population that has increased four-fold since 1980.  Each year, nearly 700,000 prisoners are released from state and federal correctional facilities, in addition to those released from local jails. As these inmates return to their families and communities, they often have difficulties establishing and maintaining healthy relationships, acquiring job skills and obtaining employment, locating safe and stable housing, meeting their child support obligations, receiving adequate health care, and understanding their voting and general citizenship rights. Many of the approximately 10 million children in the United States who are affected by incarceration suffer from stress, trauma, and stigmatization, and often exhibit a broad variety of behavioral, emotional, health, and educational problems. It is the sponsors intent to enable inmates who participate in the reunification therapy program established under the bill to improve their knowledge and understanding of the impact of incarceration on their children and families and how to respond to their needs; learn strategies to help them focus on parenting and relationships; develop employment skills; and prepare for other challenges these inmates may face when released from incarceration.
