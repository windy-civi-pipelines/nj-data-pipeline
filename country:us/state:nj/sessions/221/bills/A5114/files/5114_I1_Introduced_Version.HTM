<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 3 of P.L.2018,
c.17 (C.48:3-87.9) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  No later than one year
after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), the Board
of Public Utilities shall require each electric public utility and gas public
utility to reduce the use of electricity, or natural gas, as appropriate,
within its territory, by its customers, below what would have otherwise been
used.  For the purposes of this section, a gas public utility shall reduce the
use of natural gas for residential, commercial, and industrial uses, but shall
not be required to include a reduction in natural gas used for distributed
energy resources such as combined heat and power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each electric public utility
shall be required to achieve annual reductions in the use of electricity of two
percent of the average annual usage in the prior three years within five years
of implementation of its electric energy efficiency program.  Each natural gas
public utility shall be required to achieve annual reductions in the use of
natural gas of 0.75 percent of the average annual usage in the prior three
years within five years of implementation of its gas energy efficiency
program.  The amount of reduction mandated by the board that exceeds two
percent of the average annual usage for electricity and 0.75 percent of the
average annual usage for natural gas for the prior three years shall be
determined pursuant to the study conducted pursuant to subsection b. of this
section until the reduction in energy usage reaches the full economic,
cost-effective potential in each service territory, as determined by the board.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    No later than one year
after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), the board
shall conduct and complete a study to determine the energy savings targets for
full economic, cost-effective potential for electricity usage reduction and
natural gas usage reduction as well as the potential for peak demand reduction
by the customers of each electric public utility and gas public utility and the
timeframe for achieving the reductions.  The energy savings targets for each
electric public utility and gas public utility shall be reviewed every three
years to determine if the targets should be adjusted.  The board, in conducting
the study, shall accept comments and suggestions from interested parties.<br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     No later than one year
after the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et al.), the board
shall adopt quantitative performance indicators pursuant to the
&quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.)
for each electric public utility and gas public utility, which shall establish
reasonably achievable targets for energy usage reductions and peak demand
reductions and take into account the public utility's energy efficiency
measures and other non-utility energy efficiency measures including measures to
support the development and implementation of building code changes, appliance
efficiency standards, the Clean Energy program, any other State-sponsored
energy efficiency or peak reduction programs, and public utility energy efficiency
programs that exist on the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8 et
al.).  In establishing quantitative performance indicators, the board shall use
a methodology that incorporates weather, economic factors, customer growth,
outage-adjusted efficiency factors, and any other appropriate factors to ensure
that the public utility's incentives or penalties determined pursuant to
subsection e. of this section and section 13 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.48:3-98.1)
are based upon performance, and take into account the growth in the use of
electric vehicles, microgrids, and distributed energy resources.  In
establishing quantitative performance indicators, the board shall also consider
each public utility's customer class mix and potential for adoption by each of
those customer classes of energy efficiency programs offered by the public
utility or that are otherwise available.  The board shall review each
quantitative performance indicator every three years.  A public utility may
apply all energy savings attributable to programs available to its customers,
including demand side management programs, other measures implemented by the
public utility, non-utility programs, including those available under energy
efficiency programs in existence on the date of enactment of P.L.2018, c.17
(C.48:3-87.8 et al.), building codes, and other efficiency standards in effect,
to achieve the targets established in this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d. (1) Each electric public
utility and gas public utility shall establish energy efficiency programs and
peak demand reduction programs to be approved by the board no later than 30
days prior to the start of the energy year in order to comply with the
requirements of this section.  The energy efficiency programs and peak demand
reduction programs adopted by each public utility shall comply with
quantitative performance indicators adopted by the board pursuant to subsection
c. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The energy efficiency
programs and peak demand reduction programs shall have a benefit-to-cost ratio
greater than or equal to 1.0 at the portfolio level, considering both economic
and environmental factors, and shall be subject to review during the
stakeholder process established by the board pursuant to subsection f. of this

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that an
electric public utility or a gas public utility (collectively, utility) is not
permitted to impose or collect any rate adjustment mechanism that provides
additional revenue to the utility to account for lost revenue from the decrease
in energy usage due to customer participation in certain energy efficiency,
peak demand reduction, conservation, or renewable energy programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a utility
may provide and invest in energy efficiency, peak demand reduction,
conservation and renewable energy programs in its service territory on a
regulated basis and may, if approved by the Board of Public Utilities (board),
be permitted to impose and collect rate adjustment mechanisms that provide
additional revenue to the utility to offset a decrease in consumption for
customers participating in certain programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent to prohibit
a utility from implementing a conservation incentive program rate adjustment in
response to the testimony provided by the Director of the Division of Rate
Counsel during the October 2, 2024 Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities
Committee meeting.  The Division of Rate Counsel testified that a conservation
incentive program rate adjustment enables a utility to make up for a portion of
revenues lost due to customer participation in energy efficiency efforts by
charging that loss back to all consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors belief
that the board needs to work harder for the consumer and less for the utility
company.  There is no logical reason why ratepayers should work to reduce their
power consumption through conservation measures, such as purchasing Energy Star
appliances, increasing weatherization, installing light-emitting diode (LED)
lighting, using smart meters and thermostats, wearing warming clothing or sitting
in the dark, only to have these hard fought savings reduced or eliminated
through rate increases to make up for the utility companies loss of revenue.</p>
