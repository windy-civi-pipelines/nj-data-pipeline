set forth in P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-1 et seq.) who has been convicted of,
adjudicated delinquent or found not guilty by reason of insanity for a sex

municipality may enact an ordinance establishing areas in or around elementary
or secondary schools, playgrounds, or child care centers where a person subject
to limitations may be prohibited from residing, in order to reduce the
likelihood of contact between the person and children who are likely to gather
at such locations, thereby reducing the risk of re-offense by the person
subject to limitations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    Municipal ordinances
establishing areas where a person subject to limitations may be prohibited from
residing shall not establish areas that extend a prohibition beyond 500 feet
from the real property comprising an elementary or secondary school, playground,
or child care center, as the case may be, provided that any ordinance shall not
be formulated in a manner that would prohibit persons subject to limitations
from residing in every residentially-zoned area within the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A municipal ordinance
enacted pursuant to P.L.   , c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as
this bill) shall not be applied to prohibit a person subject to limitations
from residing within 500 feet of the real property comprising an elementary or
secondary school, playground, or child care center if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the person is required to
serve a sentence at a jail, prison, juvenile facility or other correctional
institution or facility or is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric, mental
health or other facility which is located within 500 feet of the real property
comprising an elementary or secondary school, playground, or child care center;</p>

receives services at an institution, mental health or other facility licensed
or permitted by the Department of Human Services which is located within 500
feet of the real property comprising an elementary or secondary school, playground,
or child care center;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  the parole board, after
considering the persons housing options, determines that a needs-based
exception for the person is required; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  a court that discharges
the person from a psychiatric facility with conditions pursuant to section 15
of P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.15) determines that an exception is appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.    The provisions of an
ordinance enacted pursuant to the provisions of this act shall not be applied
to prohibit a person subject to limitations from continuing to reside at a
residence established by that person within the municipality prior to the
enactment of the ordinance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     An ordinance enacted
pursuant to the provisions of this act shall provide that the municipal
engineer shall produce a map for the purpose of depicting the location and
boundaries of the areas where a person subject to limitations is prohibited
from residing pursuant to the ordinance. A true copy of the map shall, upon
proper authentication, be admissible and shall constitute prima facie evidence
of the location and boundaries of those areas, provided that the governing body
of the municipality has adopted an ordinance approving the map an official
finding and record of the location and boundaries of the area. Any map approved
pursuant to this section may be changed from time to time by the governing body
of the municipality. The original of every map approved or revised pursuant to
this section, or a true copy thereof, shall be filed with the clerk of the
municipality and shall be maintained as an official record of the municipality.
Nothing in an ordinance adopted pursuant to this section shall be construed to
preclude the prosecution from introducing or relying upon any other evidence or
testimony to establish any element of an offense; nor shall the ordinance be
construed to preclude the use or admissibility of any map or diagram other than
one which has been approved by the governing body of a municipality, provided
that the map or diagram is otherwise admissible pursuant to the Rules of
Evidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill permits a
municipality to enact an ordinance establishing areas in or around elementary
or secondary schools, playgrounds, or child care centers where certain
registered sex offenders may be prohibited from residing.  It is the
Legislatures intent to enhance the public safety by permitting municipalities
to enact ordinances to prevent convicted sex offenders who have committed
crimes against minors from residing within 500 feet of a school, playground or
child care center, subject to certain statutorily-enumerated exceptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes specific
limitations that the ordinance may impose on sex offenders establishing
residences.  These ordinances would be applicable to a person subject to
limitations, which the bill defines as a person over the age of 21 subject to
the registration requirements set forth in Megans Law who has been convicted
of, adjudicated delinquent or found not guilty by reason of insanity for a sex
offense in which the victim was under 18 years of age, except for those offenders
whose risk of re-offense has been determined to be low.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bills provisions, an
ordinance could be formulated to prohibit a person subject to limitations from
residing within 500 feet of the real property comprising an elementary or
secondary school, playground, or child care center, provided that the ordinance
does not prohibit these persons from residing in every residentially-zoned area
within the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The municipal ordinance is not
to be applied to prohibit a person from residing within 500 feet of an
elementary or secondary school, playground, or child care center if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the person is required to
serve a sentence at a jail, prison, juvenile facility or other correctional
institution or facility or is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric, mental
health or other facility which is located within 500 feet of the elementary or
secondary school, playground, or child care center;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  the person resides and
receives services at an institution, mental health or other facility licensed
or permitted by the Department of Human Services which is located within 500
feet of an elementary or secondary school, playground, or child care center;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  the parole board, after
considering the persons housing options, determines that a needs-based
exception for the person is required; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  a court that discharges
the person from a psychiatric facility determines that an exception is
appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that an
ordinance is not to be applied to prohibit a person from continuing to reside
at a residence established by that person within the municipality prior to the
enactment of the ordinance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, an ordinance
enacted pursuant to the bill is required to provide that the municipal engineer
is required to produce a map for the purpose of depicting the location and
boundaries of the areas.  The original of every map is to be filed with the
clerk of the municipality and be maintained as an official record of the
municipality.</p>
