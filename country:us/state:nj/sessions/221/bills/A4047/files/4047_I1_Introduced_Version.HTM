Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.43:21-3 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43:21-3. Benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   Payment of benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All benefits shall be promptly
paid from the fund in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed
hereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Weekly benefits for
unemployment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With respect to an
individual's benefit year commencing on or after July 1, 1961, such individual,
if eligible and unemployed (as defined in subsection (m) of R.S.43:21-19),
shall be paid an amount (except as to final payment) equal to his weekly
benefit rate less any remuneration, other than remuneration from
self-employment paid to an individual who is receiving a self-employment
assistance allowance, paid or payable to him for such week in excess of 20% of
his weekly benefit rate (fractional part of a dollar omitted) or $5.00,
whichever is the greater; provided that such amount shall be computed to the next
lower multiple of $1.00 if not already a multiple thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Weekly benefit rate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   With respect to an
individual whose benefit year commences after September 30, 1984, his weekly
benefit rate under each determination shall be 60% of his average weekly wage,
subject to a maximum of 56 2/3 % of the Statewide average weekly remuneration
paid to workers by employers subject to this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), as
determined and promulgated by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce
Development; provided, however, that such individual's weekly benefit rate
shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1.00 if not already a multiple
thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Dependency benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (A)  With respect to an
individual whose benefit year commences after September 30, 1984, the
individual's weekly benefit rate as determined in paragraph (1) of this
subsection (c) will be increased by 7% for the first dependent and 4% each for
the next two dependents (up to a maximum of three dependents), computed to the
next lower multiple of $1.00 if not already a multiple thereof, except that the
maximum weekly benefit rate payable for an individual claiming dependency
benefits shall not exceed the maximum amount determined under paragraph (1) of
this subsection (c).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B)  For the purposes of this
paragraph (2), a dependent is defined as an individual's unemployed spouse or
an unemployed unmarried child (including a stepchild or a legally adopted
child) under the age of 19 <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>or<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b><u>,</u> an
unemployed unmarried child, who is attending an educational institution as
defined in subsection (y) of R.S.43:21-19 on a full-time basis and is under the
age of 22<u>, or an unemployed unmarried disabled adult child who has blindness
or a disability which began before the age of 22. The burden of proof shall be
on the claimant to establish that an individual is a dependent, as that term is
defined in this subparagraph (B). For the purpose of this subparagraph (B),
blindness or disability shall be determined using the standard set forth within
20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, which is used by the Social Security
Administration to determine disability and blindness when evaluating
eligibility for Disabled Adult Child benefits under the Social Security Act.
For the purpose of determining under this subparagraph (B) whether an
individual is a dependent, because the individual is an adult child who has
blindness or a disability which began before the age of 22, written proof of a
determination by the Social Security Administration that the individual is
currently eligible for Disabled Adult Child benefits under the Social Security Act
shall be considered conclusive proof of dependent status</u>.  If an
individual's spouse is employed during the week the individual files an initial
claim for benefits, this paragraph (2) shall not apply. If both spouses
establish a claim for benefits in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), only one shall be entitled to dependency
benefits as provided in this paragraph (2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (C)  Any determination
establishing dependency benefits under this paragraph (2) shall remain fixed
for the duration of the individual's benefit year and shall not be increased or
decreased unless it is determined by the division that the individual
wrongfully claimed dependency benefits as a result of false or fraudulent
representation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (D)  Notwithstanding the
provisions of any other law, the division shall use every available
administrative means to insure that dependency benefits are paid only to
individuals who meet the requirements of this paragraph (2).  These
administrative actions may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    All married individuals
claiming dependents under this paragraph (2) shall be required to provide the
social security number of the individual's spouse.  If the individual indicates
that the spouse is unemployed, the division shall match the social security
number of the spouse against available wage records to determine whether
earnings were reported on the last quarterly earnings report filed by employers
under R.S.43:21-14.  If earnings were reported, the division shall contact in

such individual performs such services in the first of such academic years or
terms and there is a reasonable assurance that such individual will perform
such services in the second of such academic years or terms, except that if
benefits are denied to any individual under this paragraph (2) and the
individual was not offered an opportunity to perform these services for the
educational institution for the second of any academic years or terms, the
individual shall be entitled to a retroactive payment of benefits for each week
for which the individual filed a timely claim for benefits and for which
benefits were denied solely by reason of this clause;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   With respect to those
services described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above, benefits shall not be paid
on the basis of such services to any individual for any week which commences
during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if such
individual performs such services in the period immediately before such
vacation period or holiday recess, and there is a reasonable assurance that
such individual will perform such services in the period immediately following
such period or holiday recess;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   With respect to any
services described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above, benefits shall not be paid
as specified in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) above to any individual who
performed those services in an educational institution while in the employ of
an educational service agency, and for this purpose the term &quot;educational
service agency&quot; means a governmental agency or governmental entity which
is established and operated exclusively for the purpose of providing those
services to one or more educational institutions;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   As used in this
subsection (g) in order for there to be a &quot;reasonable assurance&quot; all
of the following requirements shall be met:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (A)  The educational
institution has made an offer of employment in the following academic year or
term that is either written, oral, or implied;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B)  The offer of employment
in the following academic year or term was made by an individual with actual
authority to offer employment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (C)  The employment offered in
the following academic year or term shall be in the same capacity;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (D)  The economic conditions
of the employment offered may not be considerably less in the following
academic year or term than in the then current academic year or term.  For the
purpose of this paragraph, &quot;considerably less&quot; means that the claimant
will earn less than 90 percent of the amount the claimant earned in the then
current academic year or term;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (E)  The offer of employment
in the following academic year or term is not contingent upon a factor or
factors that are within the educational institution's control, including but
not limited to, course programming, decisions on how to allocate available
funding, final course offerings, program changes, and facility availability;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (F)   Based on a totality of
the circumstances, it is highly probable that there is a job available for the
claimant in the following academic year or term.  If a job offer contains a
contingency, primary weight should be given to the contingent nature of the
offer of employment. Contingencies that are not necessarily within the
educational institution's control, such as funding, enrollment and seniority,
may be taken into consideration but the existence of any one contingency should
not determine whether it is highly probable that there is a job available for
the claimant in the following academic year or term. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Determinations by the
department whether claimants have a &quot;reasonable assurance&quot; shall be
done on a case-by-case basis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Each educational
institution shall provide the following to the department, in a form, including
electronic form, prescribed by the commissioner, no less than 10 business days
prior to the end of the academic year or term:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (A)  A list of all employees
who the educational institution has concluded do not have a reasonable
assurance of employment in the following academic year or term, along with
information prescribed by the commissioner regarding each such employee, which
information shall include, but not be limited to, name and social security
number; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B)  For each employee that
the educational institution maintains does have a reasonable assurance of
employment in the following academic year or term, a statement explaining the
manner in which the employee was given a reasonable assurance of employment,
that is, whether it was in writing, oral, or implied, and what information
about the offer, including contingencies, was communicated to the individual.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   The statement required
under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (7) of this subsection (g) may be used by
the department in its analysis under paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection
(g), but it does not conclusively demonstrate that the claimant has a
reasonable assurance of employment in the following academic year or term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   Failure of an
educational institution to provide the statement required under subparagraph
(B) of paragraph (7) of this subsection (g) not less than 10 business days
prior to the end of the academic year or term shall result in a rebuttable
presumption that the claimant does not have a reasonable assurance of employment
in the following academic year or term.  This rebuttable presumption shall give
rise to an inference that the claimant does not have a reasonable assurance of
employment in the following academic year or term, but shall not conclusively
demonstrate that the claimant does not have a reasonable assurance of
employment in the following academic year or term. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10) If any part of P.L.2020,
c.122 is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a
prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the State or the
eligibility of employers in this State for federal unemployment tax credits,
the conflicting part of that act is inoperative solely to the extent of the
conflict, and the finding or determination does not affect the operation of the
remainder of this act.  Rules adopted under this act shall meet federal
requirements that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by
the State or the granting of federal unemployment tax credits to employers in
this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)   Benefits shall not be
paid to any individual on the basis of any services, substantially all of which
consist of participating in sports or athletic events or training or preparing
to so participate, for any week which commences during the period between two
successive sports seasons (or similar periods) if such individual performed
such services in the first of such seasons (or similar periods) and there is a
reasonable assurance that such individual will perform such services in the
later of such seasons (or similar periods).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i) (1) Benefits shall not be
paid on the basis of services performed by an alien unless such alien is an
individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time the

the services or otherwise was permanently residing in the United States under
color of law at the time the services were performed (including an alien who is
lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the
provisions of section 212(d)(5) (8 U.S.C. s.1182 (d)(5)) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. s.1101 et seq.)); provided that any modifications of
the provisions of section 3304(a)(14) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (26
U.S.C. s. 3304 (a) (14)) as provided by Pub.L.94-566, which specify other
conditions or other effective dates than stated herein for the denial of
benefits based on services performed by aliens and which modifications are
required to be implemented under State law as a condition for full tax credit
against the tax imposed by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, shall be deemed
applicable under the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Any data or information
required of individuals applying for benefits to determine whether benefits are
not payable to them because of their alien status shall be uniformly required
from all applicants for benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   In the case of an
individual whose application for benefits would otherwise be approved, no
determination that benefits to such individual are not payable because of alien

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    R.S.43:21-5 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43:21-5.  An individual shall
be disqualified for benefits:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) For the week in which the
individual has left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to such
work, and for each week thereafter until the individual becomes reemployed and
works eight weeks in employment, which may include employment for the federal
government, and has earned in employment at least ten times the individual's
weekly benefit rate, as determined in each case.  This subsection shall apply
to any individual seeking unemployment benefits on the basis of employment in
the production and harvesting of agricultural crops, including any individual
who was employed in the production and harvesting of agricultural crops on a
contract basis and who has refused an offer of continuing work with that
employer following the completion of the minimum period of work required to
fulfill the contract.  This subsection shall not apply to an individual who voluntarily
leaves work with one employer to accept from another employer employment which
commences not more than seven days after the individual leaves employment with
the first employer, if the employment with the second employer has weekly hours
or pay not less than the hours or pay of the employment of the first employer,
except that if the individual gives notice to the first employer that the
individual will leave employment on a specified date and the first employer
terminates the individual before that date, the seven-day period will commence
from the specified date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) For the week in which the
individual has been suspended or discharged for misconduct connected with the
work, and for the five weeks which immediately follow that week, as determined in
each case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Misconduct&quot; means
conduct which is improper, intentional, connected with the individual's work,
within the individual's control, not a good faith error of judgment or
discretion, and is either a deliberate refusal, without good cause, to comply
with the employer's lawful and reasonable rules made known to the employee or a
deliberate disregard of standards of behavior the employer has a reasonable
right to expect, including reasonable safety standards and reasonable standards
for a workplace free of drug and substance use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event the discharge
should be rescinded by the employer voluntarily or as a result of mediation or
arbitration, this subsection (b) shall not apply, provided, however, an
individual who is restored to employment with back pay shall return any
benefits received under this chapter for any week of unemployment for which the
individual is subsequently compensated by the employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the discharge was for gross
misconduct connected with the work because of the commission of an act
punishable as a crime of the first, second, third or fourth degree under the
&quot;New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice,&quot; N.J.S.2C:1-1 et seq., the
individual shall be disqualified in accordance with the disqualification
prescribed in subsection (a) of this section and no benefit rights shall accrue
to any individual based upon wages from that employer for services rendered
prior to the day upon which the individual was discharged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The director shall ensure that
any appeal of a determination holding the individual disqualified for gross
misconduct in connection with the work shall be expeditiously processed by the
appeal tribunal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To sustain disqualification
from benefits because of misconduct under this subsection (b), the burden of
proof is upon the employer, who shall, prior to a determination by the
department of misconduct, provide written documentation demonstrating that the
employee's actions constitute misconduct or gross misconduct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing within this subsection
(b) shall be construed to interfere with the exercise of rights protected under
the &quot;National Labor Relations Act,&quot; (29 U.S.C. s.151 et seq.) or the
&quot;New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act,&quot; P.L.1941, c.100
(C.34:13A-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c) If it is found that the
individual has failed, without good cause, either to apply for available,
suitable work when so directed by the employment office or the director or to
accept suitable work when it is offered, or to return to the individual's
customary self-employment (if any) when so directed by the director.  The
disqualification shall continue for the week in which the failure occurred and
for the three weeks which immediately follow that week, as determined:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) In determining whether or
not any work is suitable for an individual, consideration shall be given to the
degree of risk involved to health, safety, and morals, the individual's
physical fitness and prior training, experience and prior earnings, the
individual's length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in
the individual's customary occupation, and the distance of the available work
from the individual's residence.  In the case of work in the production and
harvesting of agricultural crops, the work shall be deemed to be suitable
without regard to the distance of the available work from the individual's
residence if all costs of transportation are provided to the individual and the
terms and conditions of hire are as favorable or more favorable to the
individual as the terms and conditions of the individual's base year
employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this chapter, no work shall be deemed suitable and benefits shall
not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for
refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions: the position
offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute;
the remuneration, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are
substantially less favorable to the individual than those prevailing for
similar work in the locality; or, the individual, as a condition of being
employed, would be required to join a company union or to resign from or
refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d) If it is found that this
unemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor
dispute at the factory, establishment or other premises at which the individual
is or was last employed, except as otherwise provided by this subsection (d).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) No disqualification under
this subsection (d) shall apply if it is shown that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i) The individual is not
participating in or financing or directly interested in the labor dispute which
caused the stoppage of work; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii) The individual does not
belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the
commencement of the stoppage, there were members employed at the premises at
which the stoppage occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or
directly interested in the dispute; provided that if in any case in which
subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (1) applies, separate branches of
work which are commonly conducted as separate businesses in separate premises
are conducted in separate departments of the same premises, each department
shall, for the purpose of this subsection, be deemed to be a separate factory,
establishment, or other premises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) For any claim for a period
of unemployment commencing on or after December 1, 2004 due to a stoppage of
work which exists because of a labor dispute at the factory, establishment or
other premises at which the individual is or was last employed, no
disqualification under this subsection (d) shall apply if it is shown that the
individual has been prevented from working by the employer, even though the
individual's recognized or certified majority representative has directed the
employees in the individual's collective bargaining unit to work under the
preexisting terms and conditions of employment, and, if the period of
unemployment commenced before January 1, 2022, the employees had not engaged in
a strike immediately before being prevented from working, or if the a period of
unemployment commenced on or after January 1, 2022, whether or not the
employees had engaged in a strike immediately before being prevented from
working.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) For any claim for a period
of unemployment commencing on or after July 1, 2018 due to a stoppage of work
which exists because of a labor dispute at the factory, establishment or other
premises at which the individual is or was last employed, no disqualification under
this subsection (d) shall apply if an issue in the labor dispute is a failure
or refusal of the employer to comply with an agreement or contract between the
employer and the claimant, including a collective bargaining agreement with a
union representing the claimant, or a failure or refusal to comply with a State
or federal law pertaining to hours, wages, or other conditions of work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) For any claim for a period
of unemployment commencing on or after July 1, 2018 and before January 1, 2022,
if the unemployment is caused by a labor dispute, including a strike or other
concerted activities of employees at the claimant's workplace, whether or not
authorized or sanctioned by a union representing the claimant, but not
including a dispute subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) or (3) of this
subsection (d), the claimant shall not be provided benefits for a period of the
first 30 days following the commencement of the unemployment caused by the
labor dispute, except that the period without benefits shall not apply if the
employer hires a permanent replacement worker for the claimant's position.  A
replacement worker shall be presumed to be permanent unless the employer
certifies in writing that the claimant will be permitted to return to his or
her prior position upon conclusion of the dispute.  If the employer does not
permit the return, the claimant shall be entitled to recover any benefits lost
as a result of the 30-day waiting period before receiving benefits, and the
department may impose a penalty upon the employer of up to $750 per employee
per week of benefits lost.  The penalty collected shall be paid into the
unemployment compensation auxiliary fund established pursuant to subsection (g)
of R.S.43:21-14.  For any claim for a period of unemployment commencing on or
after January 1, 2022 due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor
dispute at the factory, establishment or other premises at which the individual
is or was last employed, including a strike or other concerted activities of employees
at the claimant's workplace, whether or not authorized or sanctioned by a union
representing the claimant, but not including a dispute subject to the
provisions of paragraph (2) or (3) of this subsection (d), the claimant shall
not be provided benefits for a period of the first 14 days following the
commencement of the unemployment caused by the labor dispute, except that the
claimant shall be provided benefits during any part of that the 14-day period
in which the employer engages the services of a replacement worker for the
claimant's position, whether that replacement worker is engaged on a permanent
or temporary basis, or is an existing worker reassigned permanently or
temporarily from other duties to perform the duties of the claimant's position. 
For any claim for a period of unemployment commencing on or after January 1,
2022 which exists because of a labor dispute at the factory, establishment or
other premises at which the individual is or was last employed, if the labor
dispute has not resulted in a stoppage of work, no disqualification under this
subsection (d) shall apply, and the 14-day waiting period in this paragraph (4)
shall not apply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e) For any week with respect
to which the individual is receiving or has received remuneration in lieu of
notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f) For any week with respect
to which or a part of which the individual has received or is seeking
unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of any other state
or of the United States; provided that if the appropriate agency of the other
state or of the United States finally determines that the individual is not
entitled to unemployment benefits, this disqualification shall not apply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g) (1) For a period of one
year from the date of the discovery by the division of the illegal receipt or
attempted receipt of benefits contrary to the provisions of this chapter, as
the result of any false or fraudulent representation; provided that any
disqualification may be appealed in the same manner as any other
disqualification imposed hereunder; and provided further that a conviction in
the courts of this State arising out of the illegal receipt or attempted
receipt of these benefits in any proceeding instituted against the individual
under the provisions of this chapter or any other law of this State shall be
conclusive upon the appeals tribunal and the board of review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) A disqualification under
this subsection shall not preclude the prosecution of any civil, criminal or
administrative action or proceeding to enforce other provisions of this chapter
for the assessment and collection of penalties or the refund of any amounts
collected as benefits under the provisions of R.S.43:21-16, or to enforce any
other law, where an individual obtains or attempts to obtain by theft or robbery
or false statements or representations any money from any fund created or
established under this chapter or any negotiable or nonnegotiable instrument
for the payment of money from these funds, or to recover money erroneously or
illegally obtained by an individual from any fund created or established under
this chapter.</p>

other provisions of this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), no otherwise eligible

Pub.L.93-618 (19 U.S.C. s.2296 (a)(1)) nor shall the individual be denied
benefits by reason of leaving work to enter this training, provided the work
left is not suitable employment, or because of the application to any week in
training of provisions in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), or any applicable
federal unemployment compensation law, relating to availability for work,
active search for work, or refusal to accept work.</p>

&quot;Trade Act of 1974,&quot; Pub.L.93-618 (19 U.S.C. s.2101 et seq.) and

the United States Armed Forces, as defined in N.J.S.38A:1-1(g), to a new place
of residence outside the State, due to the armed forces member's transfer to a

required to make payments in lieu of contributions from its responsibility to

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    R.S.43:21-6 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43:21-6. (a) Filing. (1)
Claims for benefits shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the
Director of the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of
the Department of Labor and Workforce Development of the State of New Jersey
may approve.  Each employer shall post and maintain on his premises printed
notices of his subject status, of such design, in such numbers and at such
places as the director of the division may determine to be necessary to give
notice thereof to persons in the employer's service.  Each employer shall give
to each individual at the time he becomes unemployed, for any reason, whether
the unemployment is permanent or temporary, a printed copy of benefit
instructions.  The benefit instructions given to the individual shall include,
but not be limited to, the following information: (A) the date upon which the
individual becomes unemployed, and, in the case that the unemployment is
temporary, to the extent possible, the date upon which the individual is
expected to be recalled to work; and (B) that the individual may lose some or
all of the benefits to which he is entitled if he fails to file a claim in a
timely manner.  Both the aforesaid notices and instructions, including
information detailing the time sensitivity of filing a claim, and directions
provided in advance to all employers regarding what information the division
requires employers to provide to the division by electronic means immediately
upon a separation from employment sufficient to enable the division to make a
benefit determination, including any information relevant to whether the
individual may be disqualified pursuant to subsections (a),(b),(d), or (e) of
R.S.43:21-5, shall be supplied by the division to employers without cost to
them.  The directions provided to all employers in advance shall include that
each employer provide the division with an email address for communications to
and from the division.  When an employer provides benefit instructions to the
individual which disclose the date on which unemployment will commence, the employer
shall immediately and simultaneously provide by electronic means that
disclosure to the division together with the information required by the
division pursuant to the directions provided in advance by the division.  An
employer who fails to make the immediate and simultaneous disclosure to the
department as required by this paragraph shall be liable for the penalties
imposed by subsection (b) of R.S.43:21-16 on employers for willful failure to
furnish reports.  The division shall notify the employer by electronic means
not more than seven calendar days after the department receives the disclosure
of any failure of the employer to provide all of the information needed by the
division to make a benefit determination.  Nothing in this section shall be construed
so as to require an employer to re-hire an individual formerly in the
employer's service.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring
the division to issue a benefit determination solely based on the information
supplied by the employer.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section which
require employers to provide information to the division by electronic means,
and the division to provide notifications to an employer by electronic means,
the commissioner shall have the discretion to establish by rule an alternate
method or methods for employers to provide the required information to the
division and for the division to provide the required notifications to an
employer in circumstances where it is established, to the satisfaction of the
commissioner, that the employer is unable to provide the information to the
division or is unable to receive notifications from the division by electronic
means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Any claimant may choose to
certify, cancel or close his claim for unemployment insurance benefits at any
time, 24 hours a day and seven days a week, via the Internet on a website
developed by the division; however, any claim that is certified, cancelled or
closed after 7:00 PM will not be processed by the division until the next
scheduled posting date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) The division may request
that claimants obtain digital identity credentials, but only if the division
provides opportunities for claimants to verify their identities even if they do
not have the knowledge or access to the equipment needed to obtain the digital
identity credentials.  Any request by the division for a claimant to obtain
digital identity credentials shall include a statement that the claimant may
use alternative procedures to verify identification, and fully describe the alternative
procedures, which shall include personal assistance in person or by phone which
shall be made available by representatives of the division as needed to prevent
any delay in processing claims.  If the division requests that a claimant
obtain digital identity credentials, and the claimant chooses to request a
digital identity credential rather than utilize an alternative procedure, but
is denied the digital identity credential, the division shall issue the
claimant a written appealable determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) Any system that the
division establishes for claimants or recipients of benefits to verify
identity, to apply for, or to make appeals regarding, benefits either by phone
or on-line, shall provide a clearly and prominently expressed option for the claimant
or recipient, if not immediately provided personal assistance, to select from
available appointment times an appointment time to speak with a representative
to obtain assistance in verifying identity, filing a claim or appeal, or
obtaining information regarding the status of a claim or appeal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) (1) Procedure for making
initial determinations with respect to benefit years commencing on or after
January 1, 1953.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A representative or
representatives designated by the director of the division and hereafter
referred to as a &quot;deputy&quot; shall promptly examine any disclosure of
information to the division by an employer required by paragraph (1) of
subsection (a) of this section upon a separation from work and any claim for
benefits, and shall, by electronic means, notify the most recent employing unit
and, successively as necessary, each employer in inverse chronological order
during the base year.  The notification shall be made not later than seven
calendar days after the employer provides to the department the disclosure
required by paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section, or seven calendar
days after the filing of the claim, whichever occurs first, and require said
employing unit and employer to furnish, by electronic means, not more than
seven calendar days after the notification is made, any information to the
deputy which the employer failed to provide as required by paragraph (1) of
subsection (a) of this section as may be necessary to determine the claimant's
eligibility and his benefit rights with respect to the employer in question. 
The claimant shall, at the time the claim is filed, be provided any information
the division has received from the employer upon the separation from work and
an opportunity to respond to that information.  If a claim is filed and the
employer has provided the information required upon separation from work, the
employer shall immediately be notified by electronic means of the opportunity
to provide, by electronic means and in not more than seven calendar days, additional
information in response to the claim for benefits.  If a claim is filed and the
employer has failed to provide the information required upon the separation
from work, the division shall immediately, by electronic means, request the
required information and the employer shall provide the information, by
electronic means and in not more than seven calendar days.  The division shall
provide the claimant any additional information it receives and an opportunity
to respond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If any employer or employing unit
fails to respond to the notification or request within seven calendar days
after a communication by electronic means of the notification or request, the
deputy shall rely entirely on information from other sources, including an
affidavit to the best of the knowledge and belief of the claimant with respect
to his wages and time worked.  Except in the event of a knowing, fraudulent
nondisclosure or misrepresentation by the claimant or his agent, if it is
determined that any information in such affidavit is erroneous, no penalty
shall be imposed on the claimant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The deputy shall make an
initial determination contingent upon the receipt of all necessary information
and notify the claimant no later than three weeks from the date on which the
division received the claim for benefits.  The initial determination shall show
the weekly benefit amount payable, the maximum duration of benefits with
respect to the employer to whom the determination relates, and the ratio of
benefits chargeable to the employer's account for benefit years commencing on
or after July 1, 1986, and also shall show whether the claimant is ineligible
or disqualified for benefits under the initial determination.  The employer
whose account may be charged for benefits payable pursuant to said
determination shall be promptly notified thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever an initial
determination is based upon information other than that supplied by an employer
because such employer failed to provide information as required at the time of
separation from employment, and failed to respond to the deputy's request for
additional information, benefit payments based on the determination shall
commence immediately, and such initial determination and any subsequent
determination thereunder shall be incontestable by the noncomplying employer,
as to any charges to his employer's account because of benefits paid prior to
the close of the calendar week following the receipt of his reply.  Such
initial determination shall be altered if necessary upon receipt of information
from the employer, and any benefits paid or payable with respect to weeks
occurring subsequent to the close of the calendar week following the receipt of
the employer's reply and the determination of the division to alter the initial
determination after providing the claimant the information and an opportunity
to respond shall be paid in accordance with such altered initial determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The deputy shall issue a
separate initial benefit determination with respect to each of the claimant's
base year employers, starting with the most recent employer and continuing as
necessary in the inverse chronological order of the claimant's last date of
employment with each such employer.  If an appeal is taken from an initial
determination, as hereinafter provided, by any employer other than the first
chargeable base year employer or for benefit years commencing on or after July
1, 1986, that employer from whom the individual was most recently separated,
then such appeal shall be limited in scope to include only one or more of the
following matters:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (A) The correctness of the
benefit payments authorized to be made under the determination;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B) Fraud in connection with
the claim pursuant to which the initial determination is issued;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (C) The refusal of suitable
work offered by the chargeable employer filing the appeal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (D) Gross misconduct as
provided in subsection (b) of R.S.43:21-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In his discretion, the
director may appoint special deputies to make initial or subsequent
determinations under subsection (f) of R.S.43:21-4 and subsection (d) of
R.S.43:21-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The amount of benefits payable
under an initial determination may be reduced or canceled if necessary to avoid
payment of benefits for a number of weeks in excess of the maximum specified in
subsection (d) of R.S.43:21-3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Unless the employer, within
seven calendar days after a confirmed receipt of notification of an initial
determination, including by electronic means, or the claimant, within 21
calendar days after the notification was mailed to the claimant's last-known
address and addresses, <u>or after the notification was delivered to the
claimant by electronic means, provided the departmental functionality exists to
deliver the notifications by electronic means and provided, further, that the
claimant has communicated to the division the choice to receive the
notifications by electronic means,</u> files an appeal of the decision, the
decision shall be final and benefits shall immediately be paid or denied in
accordance therewith, except for such determinations as may be altered in
benefit amounts or duration as provided in this paragraph.  An appeal
concerning an initial determination shall not be filed after whichever is
applicable of the seven-day or 21-day period.  Benefits payable for periods
pending an appeal <u>of the initial determination to the appeal tribunal</u>
shall be paid <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>as
such benefits accrue and be paid<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
according to the initial determination<u>, and benefits payable for periods
pending appeal of the determination of the appeal tribunal to the board of
review shall be paid according to the appeal tribunal determination,</u> but
shall be, to the extent that the amount paid exceeds the amount determined in
the appeal, regarded as an overpayment subject to the provisions of
R.S.43:21-16 regarding overpayments, including the requirement of that section
that a claimant who makes knowing, fraudulent nondisclosure or
misrepresentation is liable to repay the full amount of the overpayment;
provided that if the appeal is an appeal of a determination that the claimant
is disqualified under the provisions of R.S.43:21-5, benefits pending
determination of the appeal shall be withheld only for the period of
disqualification as provided for in that section, and while the appeal is
pending, the benefits otherwise provided by this act shall be paid for the
period subsequent to such period of disqualification; provided further that if
it is determined in the appeal that the claimant was not disqualified, the
claimant shall be paid the benefits due for the period of the disqualification,
except that no such benefits shall be paid to the claimant for any week during
which the claimant has failed to provide to the division a weekly certification
evidencing the claimant's eligibility for benefits; and provided, also, that if
there are two determinations of entitlement, benefits for the period covered by
such determinations shall be paid regardless of any appeal which may thereafter
be taken, but no employer's account shall be charged with benefits so paid, if
the decision is finally reversed.  If an employer appeals the charging of
benefits to the employer's account after the seven-day period to appeal the
initial benefit determination, and, as a result of the appeal on the charging
to the employer's account, the division, after the claimant is notified and
given the opportunity to respond, reduces the amount charged to the employer's
account, any resulting reduction in the amount of benefits shall take effect
only after the resolution of the appeal of the charging, and any amount of
benefits paid before the resolution of the appeal of the charging which exceeds
the amount determined in that appeal shall be regarded as an overpayment caused
by employer error <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and
shall be charged to the employer's account, and the claimant shall not be
liable to repay any portion of that overpayment where the overpayment is of
regular Unemployment Compensation.  In the case of the recovery of an
overpayment of benefit under any of the following programs authorized by the
federal &quot;Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act,&quot;
Pub.L.116-136: Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), Pandemic
Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), Mixed Earners Unemployment
Compensation (MEUC), Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), or the first week of
regular Unemployment Compensation that is reimbursed in accordance with Section
2105 of the CARES Act, a recovery shall not be waived unless the division
determines that the claimant is without fault and the repayment would be
contrary to equity and good conscience<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b><u>,
the repayment of which shall be governed by subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4)
of subsection (d) of R.S. 43:21-16</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) Procedure for making
subsequent determinations with respect to benefit years commencing on or after
January 1, 1953.  The deputy shall make determinations with respect to claims
for benefits thereafter in the course of the benefit year, in accordance with
any initial determination allowing benefits, and under which benefits have not
been exhausted, and each notification of a benefit payment shall be a
notification of an affirmative subsequent determination.  Any change in the
allowance, amount, or other characteristic of benefits by the deputy in any
such determination, or the denial of benefits by the deputy in any such
determination, shall be appealable in the same manner and under the same
limitations as is provided in the case of initial determinations, except that,
after an initial determination, the resolution of any appeal of the initial
determination, and the payment of one or more weeks of benefits pursuant to the
initial determination, if a subsequent determination will result in any
termination or reduction of those benefits from the amount or duration of
benefits specified in the initial determination, the claimant shall be provided
notification with a full written explanation of why the reduction or
termination of benefits will occur, and provided, during the seven calendar
days following the notification, an opportunity to file an appeal <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>before the
reduction or termination goes into effect<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>. 
If the claimant files an appeal during the seven-day period, benefits shall
continue to be paid at the rate, and for the duration, stipulated in the
initial determination until the appeal is resolved.  If the claimant does not
file an appeal, or the claimant files an appeal and it is found in the
resolution of the appeal that the amount in benefits paid during the processing
of the appeal exceeded the amount determined in the appeal to be correct, or
the claimant is found in the appeal to be ineligible for benefits, any
resulting excess payment of benefits shall be regarded as an overpayment
subject to the provisions of R.S.43:21-16 regarding overpayments, including the
requirement of that section that a claimant who makes knowing, fraudulent
nondisclosure or misrepresentation is liable to repay the full amount of the
overpayment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c) Appeals.  Unless such
appeal is withdrawn, an appeal tribunal, after affording the parties reasonable
opportunity for fair hearing, shall affirm or modify the findings of fact and
the determination.  The parties shall be duly notified of such tribunal's
decision, together with its reasons therefor, which shall be deemed to be the
final decision of the board of review, unless further appeal is initiated
pursuant to subsection (e) of this section within 20 days after the date of
notification or mailing of such decision for any decision made after December
1, 2010.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d) Appeal tribunals.  To hear
and decide disputed benefit claims, including appeals from determinations with
respect to demands for refunds of benefits under subsection (d) of
R.S.43:21-16, the director with the approval of the Commissioner of Labor and
Workforce Development shall establish impartial appeal tribunals consisting of
a salaried body of examiners under the supervision of a Chief Appeals Examiner,
all of whom shall be appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 11A of the
New Jersey Statutes, Civil Service and other applicable statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e) Board of review.  The
board of review may on its own motion affirm, modify, or set aside any decision
of an appeal tribunal on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in such
case, or direct the taking of additional evidence, or may permit any of the
parties to such decision to initiate further appeals before it.  The board of
review shall permit such further appeal by any of the parties interested in a
decision of an appeal tribunal which is not unanimous and from any
determination which has been overruled or modified by any appeal tribunal.  The
board of review may remove to itself or transfer to another appeal tribunal the
proceedings on any claim pending before an appeal tribunal.  Any proceedings so
removed to the board of review shall be heard by a quorum thereof in accordance
with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.  The board of review
shall promptly notify the interested parties of its findings and decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f) Procedure.  The manner in
which disputed benefit claims, and appeals from determinations with respect to
(1) claims for benefits and (2) demands for refunds of benefits under
subsection (d) of R.S.43:21-16 shall be presented, the reports thereon required
from the claimant and from employers, and the conduct of hearings and appeals
shall be in accordance with rules prescribed by the board of review for
determining the rights of the parties, whether or not such rules conform to
common law or statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of
procedure.  A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in
connection with a disputed claim.  All testimony at any hearing upon a disputed
claim shall be recorded, but need not be transcribed unless the disputed claim
is further appealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g) Witness fees.  Witnesses
subpoenaed pursuant to this section shall be allowed fees at a rate fixed by
the director.  Such fees and all expenses of proceedings involving disputed
claims shall be deemed a part of the expense of administering this chapter
(R.S.43:21-1 et seq.).</p>

mailing of a copy thereof to such party and to the party's attorney, or upon
the mailing of a copy thereof to such party at his last-known address and to
the party's attorney.  The Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability
Insurance and any party to a proceeding before the board of review may secure
judicial review of the final decision of the board of review.  Any party not
joining in the appeal shall be made a defendant; the board of review shall be
deemed to be a party to any judicial action involving the review of, or appeal
from, any of its decisions, and may be represented in any such judicial action
by any qualified attorney, who may be a regular salaried employee of the board
of review or has been designated by it for that purpose, or, at the board of
review's request, by the Attorney General.</p>

relieve any employer's account of any charge by reason of any benefits paid,
unless and until that employer can show to the satisfaction of the director of
the division that the said benefits, in whole or in part, would not have been
charged or chargeable to his account had such notice been given.  Any
determination hereunder by the director shall be subject to court review.</p>

payments made on or after October 22, 2013, an employer's account shall not be
relieved of charges related to a benefit payment that was made erroneously from
the division if it is determined that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) The erroneous benefit

been extended by the controller for not to exceed an additional 60 days;
provided that in no event may such payments which are made later than 120 days

in addition to the required amount of additional payment, liable for a penalty
of 5% thereof or $5.00, whichever is greater, not to exceed $50.00. Any

of the predecessor employer to the successor in interest, including credit for
past years, contributions paid, annual payrolls, benefit charges, et cetera,
applicable to such predecessor employer, pursuant to regulation, if it is
determined that the employment experience of the predecessor employer with
respect to the organization, trade, assets or business which has been
transferred may be considered indicative of the future employment experience of
the successor in interest.  The successor in interest may, within four months
of the date of such transfer of the organization, trade, assets or business, or
thereafter upon good cause shown, request a reconsideration of the transfer of
employment experience of the predecessor employer.  The request for
reconsideration shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the controller, that
the employment experience of the predecessor is not indicative of the future
employment experience of the successor.</p>

employer relating to the portion of the organization, trade, assets or business
transferred to the successor in interest, including credit for past years,
contributions paid, annual payrolls, benefit charges, et cetera, applicable to
such predecessor employer. The transfer of employment experience may be allowed
pursuant to regulation only if it is found that the employment experience of
the predecessor employer with respect to the portion of the organization,
trade, assets or business which has been transferred may be considered
indicative of the future employment experience of the successor in interest.

has thus been transferred.  A successor in interest to whom employment
experience or a part thereof is transferred pursuant to this subsection shall,
as of the date of the transfer of the organization, trade, assets or business,

employment experience, if any, with the employment experience acquired.  If the
successor in interest is not an employer as of the date of acquisition, it
shall be assigned the new employer rate until the effective date of the
transfer of employment experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (F)   Upon the transfer in
whole or in part of the organization, trade, assets or business to a successor
in interest, the employment experience shall not be transferred if the
successor in interest is not an employer at the time of the acquisition and the
controller finds that the successor in interest acquired the business solely or
primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the State law
regarding unemployment insurance (UI) to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Add any disabled,
unmarried adult child of a UI benefit claimant, whose disability began before
the age of 22, to the dependents counted for the purpose of calculating weekly
UI benefit amounts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Provide that an
individual otherwise eligible for UI benefits is not deemed ineligible for the
benefits solely because the individual is a student in full-time attendance, or
on vacation from, at an educational institution, so long as the individual
remains available for work, eliminating the current benefit eligibility
requirement for the individual to have earned sufficient wages while enrolled
in full-time in education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Shift the current
provisions of the UI law that permit the payment of UI benefits to a claimant
who is a participant in a department-approved training program from being an
exception to the disqualification from benefits when enrolled in full-time
education to being a circumstance under which a claimant is eligible, and
specify that the claimants participation in the program is required to be in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4) of subsection (c) of
R.S.43:21-4, which states that a claimant is not disqualified for benefits for
failing or refusing to accept work while attending the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    Permit a claimant to
request that the department make its notification of its initial determination
of the benefit claim by electronic means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    Provide that the current
requirement that benefits paid pending an appeal be paid according to the initial
determination applies only to the period before the appeal tribunal makes a
decision regarding the appeal and provide that the benefits then will be paid
according to the decision of the appeal tribunal, pending any appeal of the
appeal tribunal decision made to the board of review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    Remove the requirement
in the current law that in cases where an appeal made by an employer of a
charge to its UI tax account results in a reduction of benefits to a claimant,
any overpayment of benefits paid before the resolution of the appeal is charged
to the employers UI tax account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.    Require the Department
of Labor and Workforce Development to develop a mechanism for claimants to have
electronic access to their own benefit payment status and history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    Remove the provision of
current law that a claimant is not required to repay any of an overpayment of
UI benefits if the overpayment is not caused by a knowing, fraudulent
nondisclosure or misrepresentation by the claimant or representative of the
claimant, and is not required to repay more than 50 percent of the overpayment
if it was made because of both claimant error and department error or employer
error or nondisclosure, but without knowing, fraudulent nondisclosure or
misrepresentation by the claimant.  Instead, the bill provides that if a
claimant requests a waiver of the repayment, the department is required to
provide a full waiver repayment if the claimant did not withhold or
misrepresent any material fact to obtain benefits and the overpayment is due to
an error of the department or an error of the employer or failure of the
employers to provide information, or also if the claimant has died or become
disabled, or recovery is determined to be contrary to equity and good
conscience.  The bill also requires the department to provide a waiver, even if
the claimant makes no request, for an overpayment caused by department error,
employer error, or employer failure to provide information, if the department
has determined that the claimant did not misrepresent or withhold any material
fact to obtain benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.    Provide that the
calculation of the claimants average weekly wage used to determine a
claimants weekly benefit amount is based on wages with all base year
employers, not just the wages of the most recent employer before the layoff,
but with the total number of base weeks limited to 52.  The bill also prevents
a base-year employers UI tax account from being charged for UI benefits paid
to a claimant while the claimant continues to work for that employer but is
laid off by another base year employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  Remove, in the case of
joint State-federal extended UI benefits, the requirement that a claimant who
has been disqualified because of misconduct or failure to apply for or accept
suitable work not receive benefits until the claimant is reemployed and earns
at least four times the claimants weekly benefit rate, and replace that by
providing that the claimant need only complete the period of regular UI
disqualification to be eligible for the extended benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of sections 4
and 6 of the bill apply retroactively back to July 21, 2023.  Because all of
the provisions of the current law which are removed by section 4 and 6 of the
bill were added by P.L.2022, c.120 which went into effect on that date, having
those sections apply retroactively to that date would make it as if those
provisions had never been allowed to take effect.</p>
