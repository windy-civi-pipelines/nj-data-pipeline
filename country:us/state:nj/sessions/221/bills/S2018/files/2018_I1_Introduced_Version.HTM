Upon the transfer, no additional contributions by the member or a public employer shall be required for the service credited in the system under this subsection. Upon receipt of the remittance, the service credit accrued in the program up to July 30, 2006 shall be credited in the system and shall be used to meet any service credit requirement for benefits under system.
