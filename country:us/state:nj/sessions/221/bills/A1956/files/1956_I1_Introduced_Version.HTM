term only in the same manner as the original appointment.  The director shall
receive an annual salary as provided by law which shall be at an amount not to
exceed the annual salary of the executive director of the commission.</p>

businesses owned by minorities<u>, persons with disabilities,</u> and women
have been small establishments offering products and services and their
participation in the nation's business community has been disproportionate to
their numbers in society as a whole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The opportunity for full
participation in our free enterprise system by minorities<u>, persons with
disabilities,</u> and women is essential if social and economic justice for
them is to be attained, and the functioning of our economy improved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The role of government
at the national, State and local levels in encouraging the development of
businesses owned by minorities<u>, persons with disabilities,</u> and women has
been recognized and is developing at a rapid pace, with technical and financial
assistance, contract procurement, contract set-asides and other programs
designed to encourage development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    As a result, each year
entrepreneurs in New Jersey spend an average of $5,000.00 to demonstrate that
they qualify for these programs designed to foster the growth and development
of their businesses, so that the public agencies administering the programs can
be certain that the businesses which benefit are bona fide minority<u>,
disability-owned,</u> or women's businesses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     A unified procedure for
the certification of businesses owned by minorities<u>, persons with
disabilities,</u> and women, administered by the State, for the purpose of
certifying the eligibility of the businesses for various State programs will
eliminate duplication of effort and improve efficiency, thereby increasing
productivity and reducing costs in the public and the private sectors.</p>
