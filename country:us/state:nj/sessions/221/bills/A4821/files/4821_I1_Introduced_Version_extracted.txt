A4821 ASSEMBLY, No. 4821 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED SEPTEMBER 19, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  JULIO MARENCO District 33 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS Requires OIT to develop NJ generative artificial intelligence program and implement artificial intelligence education courses with county governments; appropriates $1.5 million. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning generative artificial intelligence, supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, and making an appropriation. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    As used in P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill: Artificial intelligence means: a.    any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight or that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets; b. an artificial system developed in computer software, physical hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical action; c.    an artificial system designed to think or act like a human, including cognitive architectures and neural networks; d.    a set of techniques, including machine learning, that is designed to approximate a cognitive task; or e.    an artificial system designed to act rationally, including an intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating, decision making, and acting. Generative artificial intelligence means an artificial intelligence that is capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data in response to prompts. Natural language processing means the use of artificial intelligence to enable computers to interpret and comprehend human language. New Jersey generative artificial intelligence program or program means the generative artificial intelligence program created pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 2.    The Office of Information Technology shall: a. develop a New Jersey generative artificial intelligence program that shall be made available to the public and utilize natural language processing to respond to user prompts; b.    annually subject the program to a safety test that includes, at minimum: (1)  an analysis of potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities; and (2)  descriptions of possible remedies or defensive measures that can be taken by the Office of Information Technology to address all potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities during the conducting of the safety test; and c.    implement appropriate remedies and defensive measures identified pursuant to subsection b. of this section. 3.    The Office of Information Technology shall coordinate with the board of county commissioners, county executive, county manager, or county supervisor, as appropriate, of each county to implement instructional courses that educate residents on artificial intelligence and natural language processing.  Such courses shall be offered in-person and on the county governments Internet websites and include, at a minimum: a.    education on what artificial intelligence is and how generative artificial intelligence is different from other artificial intelligence technologies; and b.    education on methods for identifying and mitigating potential output inaccuracies, fabricated text, and biases of generative artificial intelligence while respecting the privacy of the public and complying with all applicable State and federal laws and policies. 4.    a.  There is appropriated from the General Fund to the Office of Information Technology the sum of $1,000,000 [EA1] to fund the development of the New Jersey generative artificial intelligence program established pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    There is appropriated from the General Fund to the Office of Information Technology the sum of $500,000 for the purpose of providing grants to county governments for the purpose of implementing instructional courses pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the New Jersey Office of Information Technology (OIT) to develop a New Jersey generative artificial intelligence program and coordinate with county governments to implement artificial intelligence education courses.  The bill defines generative artificial intelligence as an artificial intelligence that is capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data in response to prompts.  Under this bill, OIT is required to annually subject the New Jersey generative artificial intelligence program to a safety test that includes, at minimum: (1) an analysis of potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities; and (2) descriptions of possible remedies or defensive measures that can be taken by OIT to address all potential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities during the conducting of the safety test.  The bill requires OIT to implement appropriate remedies and defensive measures identified during the safety test. The bill also requires that the education courses teach residents about artificial intelligence and natural language processing, which is the use of artificial intelligence to enable computers to interpret and comprehend human language.  The courses are to include, at a minimum, education on: (1) what artificial intelligence is and how generative artificial intelligence is different from other artificial intelligence technologies; and (2) methods for identifying and mitigating potential output inaccuracies, fabricated text, and biases of generative artificial intelligence while respecting the privacy of the public and complying with all applicable State and federal laws and policies.
