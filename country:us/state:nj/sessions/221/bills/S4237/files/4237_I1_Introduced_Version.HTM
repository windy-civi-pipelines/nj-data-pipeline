the commencement of such proceeding, the sending of such notice of refusal to answer shall be subject to order of the court in which the proceeding was brought in a manner and on such terms as the court may deem just.  If a proceeding is not brought within ten days, notice of refusal shall thereupon be sent as provided in this subsection. e.     Removal of disqualification of public contractors

STATEMENT This bill includes Jewish persons within the definitions of minority, minority group member, and minority business in laws concerning public contracts and grants. Under current law concerning public contracts and grants, the definitions of minority, minority group member, and minority business include persons who are black, Hispanic, Asian-American, American Indian or Alaskan natives, and, in certain definitions, Portuguese.  This bill would add Jewish persons to such definitions.

the commencement of such proceeding, the sending of such notice of refusal to answer shall be subject to order of the court in which the proceeding was brought in a manner and on such terms as the court may deem just.  If a proceeding is not brought within ten days, notice of refusal shall thereupon be sent as provided in this subsection. e.     Removal of disqualification of public contractors

(2)   Upon the filing of a petition described in paragraph (1) of this subsection the court may stay as to petitioner, pending a decision upon the petition, the cancellation or termination of any contracts resulting from such refusal upon such terms as to notice or otherwise as may be just. (3)   At least two days prior to the return day, the officer who conducted the investigation before the grand jury or other body and the attorney general may file answers to the petition or apply for judgment dismissing the petition as a matter of law.  On or before the return day the petitioner may file a reply to the answer. (4)   Upon the return day the court may, upon the petition and answer and other papers filed, forthwith render such judgment as the case requires, or if a triable issue of fact is duly raised, it shall forthwith be tried before a court sitting without a jury or before a referee.  The provisions of statute or rule governing references in an action shall apply to a reference under this section. (5)   The court shall render judgment dismissing the petition on the merits or discontinuing the disqualification upon the ground that the public interest would be served by its discontinuance, and granting such other relief as to the cancellation or termination of contracts as may be appropriate, but without costs to petitioner. f.     Statement of non-collusion in bids or proposals to the Commission.
