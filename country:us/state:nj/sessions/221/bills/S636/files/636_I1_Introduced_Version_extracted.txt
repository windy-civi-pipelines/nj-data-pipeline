This bill revises these requirements to provide that an applicant is only required to complete at least two years, instead of three, or 3000 hours of supervised full-time counseling experience in a professional counseling setting, one year or 1500 hours of which may be obtained prior to the granting of the master's degree.  The bill also provides that an applicant may eliminate one year or 1500 hours of the required supervised counseling experience by substituting certain graduate semester hours beyond the master's degree; however, an applicant cannot have less than one year or 1500 hours of supervised professional counseling experience after the granting of the master's degree.
