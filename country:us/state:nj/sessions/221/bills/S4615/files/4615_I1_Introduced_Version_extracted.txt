S4615 SENATE, No. 4615 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 19, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  BENJIE E. WIMBERLY District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) Senator  ANGELA V. MCKNIGHT District 31 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS "Protection of Homeownership and Limiting Institutional Investor Acquisition Act"; imposes limitations and establishes certain incentives and disincentives concerning acquisition of single-family residences. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act promoting family homeownership, including through restrictions, assistance, and tax incentives and disincentives related to single-family residences, and supplementing and amending various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the "Protection of Homeownership and Limiting Institutional Investor Acquisition Act." 2.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The Great Recession of 2008-2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to fundamental changes in the real estate market and facilitated a dramatic transfer of wealth from low-, moderate-, and middle-income households to the wealthy, due in substantial part to the surge of institutional investors in the residential real estate market that purchase and convert substantial numbers of single-family homes into rental properties; b.    Single-family homes purchased by institutional investors may be completely taken off the market for individual homebuyers, leading to the concentration of single-family homes, capital, and market power in the hands of large institutional investors; c.     Institutional investors thereby cripple the ability of individual homebuyers to compete with and purchase single-family homes, since institutional investors have a ready supply of capital, high liquidity, and significant bargaining power compared to individual homebuyers; d.    Homeownership, which commonly begins with the purchase of a small- or moderate-sized single-family home, or starter home, is essential for building wealth and for retirement, including through equity, tax deduction incentives, and capital gains exclusions on sales, and therefore provides for generational wealth; e.     The influx of institutional investors in the real estate market has contributed to the increase in the cost of living, which has skyrocketed since 2008, making the American dream of homeownership unattainable for many; f.     While an October 2022 study, entitled "Buying New Jersey: The Rise of Institutional Ownership of Residential Properties," produced by the Office of Policy and External Affairs in the Department of Community Affairs, observed that approximately six percent of residential properties were institutionally owned as of 2020, institutional investors wield a tremendous amount of market power at significantly lower market shares; g.  The unique structure of the housing market enables institutional investors, through their purchasing behavior, to manipulate both supply and demand in the markets for single-family home sales and single-family home rentals; h.    To account for the gross imbalance in market power between institutional investors and individual homebuyers in New Jersey, it is critical for legislative responses to not only place reasonable restrictions on the ability of institutional investors to dominate the residential real estate market, but also to increase the power of individual homebuyers to compete with institutional investors; and i.     Therefore, it is necessary and proper for the Legislature to place reasonable restrictions on institutional investors related to the purchase of single-family homes; impose tax incentives and disincentives on certain acquisitions by institutional investors to help stabilize homeownership opportunities for New Jersey families; provide additional down payment assistance for individual homebuyers for the purchase of starter homes; expedite the production of single-family and starter homes by reducing certain statutory and regulatory impediments; provide tax incentives for the development of single-family and starter homes; and enable individual New Jersey homebuyers to claim certain gross income tax deductions. 3.    (New section)  As used in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): "Affordable housing" means an inclusionary development, as defined pursuant to subsection f. of section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304), and other low- and moderate-income housing.

(2)  A portion of the funding for the loan program shall be allocated to provide down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers to purchase starter homes and affordable starter homes. b.  (1)  The down payment assistance provided pursuant to this section shall be in the form of a zero-interest, forgivable loan award.  The loan award shall be in an amount not to exceed $20,000.  The agency shall be authorized to provide an additional zero-interest, forgivable loan award of up to $5,000 if the first-time homebuyer provides matching down payment funds in an amount to be determined by the executive director. (2)  In addition to a loan award that may be provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, a first-generation homebuyer shall be eligible for a zero-interest, forgivable loan award of an additional award amount of not less than $7,000 and not more than $10,000 to be used for down payment assistance. (3)  Each first-time homebuyer who receives down payment assistance through the loan program shall, prior to the award of down payment assistance, complete a homebuyer counseling course, as directed by the agency pursuant to subsection c. of this section.  The homebuyer counseling course may include, but not be limited to, coursework concerning: (a)  the maintenance of housing costs, including methods for budgeting mortgage payments, utility charges, property taxes, and any other applicable housing cost; (b)  the basics of home finance, property taxes, home warranties, and home inspection; (c)  the legal components of finalizing a home purchase; and (d)  the process of finding an appropriate house, including how to search real estate listings through a real estate agent or other sources. c.  The executive director shall develop program guidelines to effectuate, administer, and accomplish the purposes of the loan program.  The guidelines shall, at a minimum, set forth the requirements for application submissions, the criteria for application selections, the eligible uses of down payment assistance, eligibility as a first-time or first-generation homebuyer, and the curriculum and provision of the homebuyer counseling course. d.  The agency shall permit an individual to establish eligibility for the loan program as a first-generation homebuyer via self-attestation, under penalty of perjury.  However, nothing in this subsection shall preclude the agency from establishing measures to identify and deter fraudulent attestations.  If it is established that an individual has received assistance as a result of a fraudulent attestation, the individual shall reimburse the agency for the assistance. e.  A down payment assistance loan shall be recoverable as a lien on the real property that the loan is used to purchase, and shall have the priority of a mortgage lien. f.  The annual appropriations act for State fiscal year 2024 shall include an appropriation from the General Fund to the loan program, and the annual appropriations acts following State fiscal year 2024 shall appropriate not less than $25 million from the General Fund to the Community Investment Fund in the agency, established pursuant to section 11 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), [during] each State fiscal year [in which the loan program remains in operation,] to effectuate the purposes of the loan program, and defray the costs associated with administering the loan program, except that the agency shall retain not more than five percent of the annual appropriation for administrative costs. Of the total amount of down payment assistance funding awarded each State fiscal year through the loan program, no less than 50 percent shall be awarded to first-generation homebuyers, unless the agency determines that 50 percent of the down payment assistance funding cannot be awarded to first-generation homebuyers, because too few first-generation homebuyers have applied for the loan program, in which case, more than 50 percent of the funding shall be awarded to first-time homebuyers who are not first-generation homebuyers. g.  No later than the 730th day next following the effective date of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104 et al.), the agency shall prepare and submit a report to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature.  The report shall analyze the efficacy of the loan program.  The report shall provide an overview of the total amount of down payment assistance provided by the agency, with information by census tract on the race and ethnicity of the recipients of assistance.  The report also shall analyze: (1)  the impact of the down payment assistance on the total housing costs of the recipients of such assistance; (2)  the impact of the additional loan award for first-generation homebuyers provided pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section, and the other components of the loan program, on first-generation homeownership; and (3)  any other information determined by the agency to be relevant to the costs and benefits of the loan program. (cf: P.L.2024, c.23, s.2) 11.  (New section)  a.  There is created a special fund in the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, which shall be known as the "Community Investment Fund," and shall be administered by the agency as a revolving fund for carrying out the purposes of the loan program established pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-105). b.    Moneys to be deposited into the Community Investment Fund shall include, but shall not be limited to: (1)  all moneys appropriated and made available pursuant to subsection f of section 2 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-105), and otherwise made available by the Legislature for inclusion therein; (2)  any other moneys made available to the agency from any source or sources, which the executive director shall determine to use for the purposes authorized by the loan program; and (3)  moneys earned through investment pursuant to subsection c. of this section. c.     Any moneys held in the Community Investment Fund that are not able to be disbursed immediately may be invested and reinvested.       d.         A portion of the funds expended from the Community Investment Fund for the purposes of the loan program shall be used for the purpose of providing down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers to purchase starter homes and affordable starter homes under P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104 et al.). 12.  Section 6 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-10) is amended to read as follows: 6. Hearings.  a.  The municipal agency shall hold a hearing on each application for development, adoption, revision or amendment of the master plan, each application for approval of an outdoor advertising sign submitted to the municipal agency as required pursuant to an ordinance adopted under subsection g. of section 29.1 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-39) or any review undertaken by a planning board pursuant to section 22 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-31). b.    The municipal agency shall make the rules governing such hearings.  Any maps and documents for which approval is sought at a hearing shall be on file and available for public inspection at least 10 days before the date of the hearing, during normal business hours in the office of the administrative officer.  The applicant may produce other documents, records, or testimony at the hearing to substantiate or clarify or supplement the previously filed maps and documents. c.     The officer presiding at the hearing or such person as he may designate shall have power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant evidence, including witnesses and documents presented by the parties, and the provisions of the "County and Municipal Investigations Law," P.L.1953, c.38 (C.2A:67A-1 et seq.) shall apply. d.    The testimony of all witnesses relating to an application for development shall be taken under oath or affirmation by the presiding officer, and the right of cross-examination shall be permitted to all interested parties through their attorneys, if represented, or directly, if not represented, subject to the discretion of the presiding officer and to reasonable limitations as to time and number of witnesses. e.     Technical rules of evidence shall not be applicable to the hearing, but the agency may exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. f.     The municipal agency shall provide for the verbatim recording of the proceedings by either stenographer, mechanical or electronic means.  The municipal agency shall furnish a transcript, or duplicate recording in lieu thereof, on request to any interested party at his expense; provided that the governing body may provide by ordinance for the municipality to assume the expense of any transcripts necessary for appeal to the governing body, pursuant to section 8 of [this act] P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-17), of decisions by the zoning board of adjustment pursuant to subsection [57d. of this act] d. of section 57 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-70), up to a maximum amount as specified by the ordinance. The municipal agency, in furnishing a transcript or tape of the proceedings to an interested party at his expense, shall not charge such interested party more than the actual cost of preparing the transcript or tape.  Transcripts shall be certified in writing by the transcriber to be accurate. g.    The municipal agency shall include findings of fact and conclusions based thereon in each decision on any application for development and shall reduce the decision to writing.  The municipal agency shall provide the findings and conclusions through: (1)   A resolution adopted at a meeting held within the time period provided in the act for action by the municipal agency on the application for development; or (2)   A memorializing resolution adopted at a meeting held not later than 45 days, or 30 days for an application for development, for which at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, 40 percent of the lots on which residential dwellings are to be constructed, or 40 percent of the total acreage, is to be used for the construction and development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), after the date of the meeting at which the municipal agency voted to grant or deny approval.  Only the members of the municipal agency who voted for the action taken may vote on the memorializing resolution, and the vote of a majority of such members present at the meeting at which the resolution is presented for adoption shall be sufficient to adopt the resolution.  If only one member who voted for the action attends the meeting at which the resolution is presented for adoption, the resolution may be adopted upon the vote of that member.  An action pursuant to section 5 of [the act] P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-9) (resulting from the failure of a motion to approve an application) shall be memorialized by resolution as provided above, with those members voting against the motion for approval being the members eligible to vote on the memorializing resolution. The vote on any such resolution shall be deemed to be a memorialization of the action of the municipal agency and not to be an action of the municipal agency; however, the date of the adoption of the resolution shall constitute the date of the decision for purposes of the mailings, filings and publications required by subsections h. and i. of this section [(C.40:55D-10)].  If the municipal agency fails to adopt a resolution or memorializing resolution as hereinabove specified, any interested party may apply to the Superior Court in a summary manner for an order compelling the municipal agency to reduce its findings and conclusions to writing within a stated time, and the cost of the application, including attorney's fees, shall be assessed against the municipality. h.    A copy of the decision shall be mailed by the municipal agency within 10 days of the date of decision to the applicant or, if represented, then to his attorney, without separate charge, and to all who request a copy of the decision, for a reasonable fee.  A copy of the decision shall also be filed by the municipal agency in the office of the administrative officer.  The administrative officer shall make a copy of such filed decision available to any interested party for a reasonable fee and available for public inspection at his office during reasonable hours i.     A brief notice of the decision shall be published in the official newspaper of the municipality, if there be one, or in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality.  Such publication shall be arranged by the applicant unless a particular municipal officer is so designated by ordinance; provided that nothing contained in [this act] P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) shall be construed as preventing the applicant from arranging such publication if he so desires.  The municipality may make a reasonable charge for its publication.  The period of time in which an appeal of the decision may be made shall run from the first publication of the decision, whether arranged by the municipality or the applicant. (cf: P.L.2004, c.42, s.5) 13.  Section 34 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-46) is amended to read as follows: a. An ordinance requiring site plan review and approval shall require that the developer submit to the administrative officer a site plan and such other information as is reasonably necessary to make an informed decision as to whether the requirements necessary for preliminary site plan approval have been met.  The site plan and any engineering documents to be submitted shall be required in tentative form for discussion purposes for preliminary approval. If any architectural plans are required to be submitted for site plan approval, the preliminary plans and elevations shall be sufficient. b. If the planning board required any substantial amendment in the layout of improvements proposed by the developer that have been the subject of a hearing, an amended application for development shall be submitted and proceeded upon, as in the case of the original application for development.  The planning board shall, if the proposed development complies with the ordinance and [this act] P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.), grant preliminary site plan approval. c. Upon the submission to the administrative officer of a complete application for a site plan which involves 10 acres of land or less, and 10 dwelling units or less, the planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within 45 days, or 30 days for such an application, for which at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, 40 percent of the lots on which residential dwellings are to be constructed, or 40 percent of the total acreage, is to be used for the construction and development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), of the date of such submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer.  Upon the submission of a complete application for a site plan which involves more than 10 acres, or more than 10 dwelling units, the planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within 95 days, or 60 days for such an application, for which at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, 40 percent of the lots on which residential dwellings are to be constructed, or 40 percent of the total acreage, is to be used for the construction and development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), of the date of such submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer.  Otherwise, the planning board shall be deemed to have granted preliminary approval of the site plan. (cf: P.L.1984, c.20, s.8) 14.  Section 14 of P.L.1979, c.216 (C.40:55D-46.1) is amended to read as follows: 14. An ordinance requiring, pursuant to section 7.1 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-12), notice of hearings on applications for development for conventional site plans, may authorize the planning board to waive notice and public hearing for an application for development, if the planning board or site plan subcommittee of the board appointed by the chairman finds that the application for development conforms to the definition of "minor site plan." Minor site plan approval shall be deemed to be final approval of the site plan by the board, provided that the board or said subcommittee may condition such approval on terms ensuring the provision of improvements pursuant to sections 29, 29.1, 29.3 and 41 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-38, 40:55D-39, 40:55D-41 and 40:55D-53). a. Minor site plan approval shall be granted or denied within 45 days of the date of submission of a complete application to the administrative officer, within 30 days for such an application, for which at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, 40 percent of the lots on which residential dwellings are to be constructed, or 40 percent of the total acreage, is to be used for the construction and development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), or within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.  Failure of the planning board to act within the period prescribed shall constitute minor site plan approval. b. Whenever review or approval of the application by the county planning board is required by section 8 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.6), the municipal planning board shall condition any approval that it grants upon timely receipt of a favorable report on the application by the county planning board or approval by the county planning board by its failure to report thereon within the required time period. c. The zoning requirements and general terms and conditions, whether conditional or otherwise, upon which minor site plan approval was granted, shall not be changed for a period of two years after the date of minor site plan approval. The planning board shall grant an extension of this period for a period determined by the board but not exceeding one year from what would otherwise be the expiration date, if the developer proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the board that the developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with the development because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other governmental entities and that the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued the approvals.  A developer shall apply for this extension before: (1) what would otherwise be the expiration date, or (2) the 91st day after the date on which the developer receives the last of the legally required approvals from the other governmental entities, whichever occurs later. (cf: P.L.1991, c.256, s.8) 15.  Section 36 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-48) is amended to read as follows: a.     An ordinance requiring subdivision approval by the planning board shall require that the developer submit to the administrative officer a plat and such other information as is reasonably necessary to make an informed decision as to whether the requirements necessary for preliminary approval have been met; provided that minor subdivisions pursuant to section 35 of [this act] P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-47) shall not be subject to this section.  The plat and any other engineering documents to be submitted shall be required in tentative form for discussion purposes for preliminary approval. b.    If the planning board required any substantial amendment in the layout of improvements proposed by the developer that have been the subject of a hearing, an amended application shall be submitted and proceeded upon, as in the case of the original application for development.  The planning board shall, if the proposed subdivision complies with the ordinance and [this act] P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.), grant preliminary approval to the subdivision. c.     Upon the submission to the administrative officer of a complete application for a subdivision of 10 or fewer lots, the planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within 45 days, or 30 days for a complete application for a subdivision of 10 or fewer lots for which at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, 40 percent of the lots on which residential dwellings are to be constructed, or 40 percent of the total acreage, is to be used for the construction and development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), of the date of such submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer.  Upon the submission of a complete application for a subdivision of more than 10 lots, the planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within 95 days, or 60 days for a complete application for a subdivision of more than 10 lots for which at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, 40 percent of the lots on which residential dwellings are to be constructed, or 40 percent of the total acreage, is to be used for the construction and development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), of the date of such submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer.  Otherwise, the planning board shall be deemed to have granted preliminary approval to the subdivision. (cf: P.L.1984, c.20, s.9) 16.  Section 14 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-132) is amended to read as follows: 14. a.  The enforcing agency shall periodically inspect all construction undertaken pursuant to a construction permit issued by it to ensure that the construction or alteration is performed in accordance with the conditions of the construction permit and consistent with the requirements of the code and any ordinance implementing said code. b.    The owner of any premises upon which a building or structure is being constructed shall be deemed to have consented to the inspection by the enforcing agency and the department, of the entire premises and of any and all construction being performed on it until a certificate of occupancy has been issued.  An inspector, or team of inspectors, on presentation of proper credentials, shall have the right to enter and inspect such premises, and any and all construction thereon, for purposes of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the applicable construction permit, the code, and other applicable laws and regulations.  All inspection pursuant to P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.) shall be between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on business days or at another time that has been agreed upon by the owner and the relevant inspecting entity, whether the enforcing agency, department, or private on-site inspection agency, or when construction is actually being undertaken, provided, however, that inspections may be conducted at other times if the enforcing agency has reasonable cause to believe that an immediate danger to life, limb or property exists, or if permission is given by an owner, or the owner's agent, architect, engineer or builder.  No person shall accompany an inspector or team of inspectors on any inspection pursuant to P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), unless the person's presence is necessary for the enforcement of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), or the code, or unless consent is given by an owner or the owner's agent, architect, engineer or builder. c.     If the construction of a structure or building is being undertaken contrary to the provisions of a construction permit, P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), the code, or other applicable laws or ordinances, the enforcing agency may issue a stop construction order in writing which shall state the conditions upon which construction may be resumed and which shall be given to the owner or the holder of the construction permit or to the person performing the construction.  If the person doing the construction is not known, or cannot be located with reasonable effort, the notice may be delivered to the person in charge of, or apparently in charge of, the construction.  No person shall continue, or cause or allow to be continued, the construction of a building or structure in violation of a stop construction order, except with the permission of the enforcing agency to abate a dangerous condition or remove a violation, or except by court order.  If an order to stop construction is not obeyed, the enforcing agency may apply to the appropriate court as otherwise established by law for an order enjoining the violation of the stop construction order.  The remedy for violation of such an order provided in this subsection shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedies provided by law or ordinance. d.    When an inspector or team of inspectors finds a violation of the provisions of a construction permit, the code, or other applicable laws and regulations at an owner-occupied single-family residence, and issues a notice of violation and an order to terminate the violation, the enforcing agency shall require the same inspector or team of inspectors who found the violation to undertake any subsequent reinspection thereof at the premises.  When the same inspector or team of inspectors cannot be assigned to undertake the reinspection, the enforcing agency may assign an available inspector provided the scope of the reinspection shall be limited to the violation for which the reinspection is required.  The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to violations of the plumbing or electrical subcodes, or to fire safety code violations, or to any violation of any other subcode that the Department of Community Affairs determines to be a health or safety violation.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to infringe upon the right of a property owner to request a different inspector, team of inspectors, or supervisor, to perform any required reinspection. e.     The owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work shall notify the enforcing agency when the work is ready for any required inspection under the code.  This notice shall be given in writing at least 24 hours prior to the date and time requested for the inspection.  The enforcing agency shall perform an inspection within three business days of the date for which the inspection is requested.  The owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work may provide oral notice for inspections of minor work projects, as defined by the code. (1)   The owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work shall be present and prepared at the time of any inspection that has been scheduled upon the owner, agent, or other responsible person's request.  A failure by the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work to be present and prepared for inspection shall be considered a failed inspection. (2)   If the enforcing agency is unable to perform a requested inspection within three business days of the date for which the inspection is requested, the enforcing agency shall inform the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work in writing within 24 hours of receiving the request, at which time the enforcing agency and the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work may agree to a different date and time for inspection.  The enforcing agency shall commit the agreed upon inspection date to writing and provide a copy to the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work. (3)   If the enforcing agency is unable to perform the requested inspection within three business days of the date for which the inspection is requested and the enforcing agency and the owner, agent, or responsible person in charge of work are unable to come to an agreement pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work may choose to contract with a private on-site inspection agency authorized by the department to conduct on-site inspections pursuant to paragraph i. of section 6 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-124) to perform the requested inspection or inspections. (a)   The owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work shall notify the enforcing agency in writing of any choice to utilize an authorized private on-site inspection agency to conduct the requested inspection or inspections. (b)   The owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work may elect to utilize the private on-site inspection agency to conduct all subsequent associated inspections.  In the event of a project with multiple units in one building, this provision shall apply to the specific unit or units affected by the inspection delay. (c)   The use of a private on-site inspection agency by an owner, agent, or other responsible person for on-site inspections shall be subject to the conflict-of-interest provisions in the code.  In addition to those requirements, no private on-site inspection agency shall perform an inspection for any owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work, if an owner, agent, or other responsible person is currently employed by or affiliated with any individual affiliated with the private on-site inspection agency or has employed or was associated with an individual affiliated with the private on-site inspection agency within a timeframe established by the commissioner by regulation. (d)   The enforcing agency shall, if warranted, provide a fee reconciliation to the owner for an inspection completed by a private on-site inspection agency as a result of a missed inspection.  The enforcing agency shall perform the reconciliation at the conclusion of the project.  This reconciliation shall be based on the fees already paid less administrative costs for the enforcing agency and shall not exceed the amount already paid for the project, nor shall it exceed the amount that the enforcing agency is authorized to impose for inspections, and shall take into account the administrative costs of the enforcing agency. (4)   If the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work believes an enforcing agency has demonstrated a repeated inability to conduct inspections for a construction project within the timelines required by this section, as established by the commissioner by regulation, the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work may notify the department in writing to request authorization to utilize an authorized private on-site inspection agency.  Within 15 business days of receiving a notification under this paragraph, the department shall determine whether the enforcing agency has demonstrated repeated inability, and, if the department determines, shall authorize the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work to utilize an authorized private on-site inspection agency for all or a portion of the necessary inspections for the remainder of the project. f.     Each enforcing agency shall establish a process for ensuring inspections are performed within three business days of a requested inspection date, as required by subsection e. of this section.  Authorized processes include, but are not limited to, the use of supplemental shared services agreements with other municipalities or enforcing agencies or the use of contracted private on-site inspection agencies, including supplemental private on-site inspection agencies. g. (1)  At timeframes established by the commissioner by regulation, adopted in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the municipal construction official shall submit an annual report detailing compliance with the code.  The report shall include, at a minimum information related to the staffing, staff titles, and expenses of the enforcing agency, in addition to any other information required by the commissioner.  The annual report shall take into account projected work and agency resource needs for the next budget year. (2)   A municipality that enters into a contract for supplemental services pursuant to subsection f. of this section shall provide a copy of the contract to the department upon entering into the contract. (3)   The information required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, in addition to the inspection log, the municipal monthly activity reports, and the fee schedule shall be maintained by the municipal construction official or enforcing agency, and the municipal construction official or enforcing agency shall make the information and documents described in this paragraph available to the department upon request.

STATEMENT This bill, the "Protection of Homeownership and Limiting Institutional Investor Acquisition Act": (1) restricts institutional investor acquisition of single-family homes and imposes certain tax penalties on acquisition of single-family homes by institutional investors; (2) provides down payment assistance and funding for certain homebuyers and developers for the purchase and development of starter homes; (3) reduces the timeframe for the approval of development applications to certain municipal government entities, and expedites starter home inspections; (4) requires the creation of a buyers home purchasing guide and establishment of a public awareness campaign concerning the impact of institutional investors on the housing market; (5) permits resident taxpayers who are first-time homebuyers to claim certain gross income tax deductions; and (6) establishes the "Starter Home Development Incentive Program" within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. Restrictions on Institutional Investor Acquisition of Single-Family Homes and Imposition of Certain Tax Penalties: Sections 3 through 6 of the bill prohibit certain institutional investors from placing a bid on or purchasing a single-family home during the first 90 days that the home is available, and subject an institutional investor who owns or acquires a single-family home to certain taxes. Specifically, the bill prohibits an institutional investor, as defined in the bill, from contacting the owner of a single-family home, or the owners agent, with respect to the single-family home, or soliciting, placing a bid on, or inducing an offer for, a single-family home during the first 90 days that the single-family home is "on the market and available for purchase," as the term is defined in the bill.  To discourage circumvention of the bill by institutional investors, the bill provides that an institutional investor that places a bid on, acquires, or purchases a single-family home outside of the 90-day period set forth in the bill is to be subject to an annual State tax in an amount equal to the product of $25,000, and the number of single-family homes owned by the institutional investor as of the last day of the tax year.  The State tax revenue collected through the tax is to be credited to the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency to establish new programs or supplement existing programs that award grants to provide down payment assistance to families purchasing single-family homes in the State.  The bill authorizes the Director of the Division of Taxation (director) and the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) to require institutional investors to report certain information provided in the bill.  The bill also prohibits an institutional investor from leasing a single-family home acquired or purchased by the institutional investor for a period of five years following the date of acquisition or purchase. The bill would not apply to certain nonprofit organizations; small institutional investors, as defined in the bill; financial institutions owning or acquiring a single-family home through foreclosure or through a secured transaction; institutional investors acting as condemnors; governmental authorities; or other institutional investors excepted from the requirements of the bill by the commissioner.  An institutional investor that violates the bill is to be required to alienate the single-family home within six months of acquisition, and any profit received is to be payable to the Attorney General.  A violation of the bill is to also constitute an unlawful practice in violation of the New Jersey consumer fraud act.   Further, notwithstanding a penalty collected by the Attorney General pursuant to the bill, the bill permits any person or entity directly and adversely affected by a violation to file a complaint against an institutional investor in violation of the bill.  The complainant would be permitted to recover $20,000, which is required to be proportionately divided amongst any person or entity, including a small institutional investor, directly and adversely affected by a violation who filed a complaint within 24 months of the date that the violation occurred, in addition to certain fees and expenses incurred in proving a violation of the bill. This portion of the bill would take effect on the first day of the sixth month next following the date of enactment, and sections 5 and 6 of the bill would apply to the tax year beginning on or after January 1 following the date of enactment. Down Payment Assistance, Developer Funding, and the Community Investment Fund: Sections 7 through 11 of the bill provide down payment assistance and developer funding for the purchase and development of starter homes and affordable starter homes. The bill modifies a down payment assistance loan program (loan program), established for the benefit of first-time homebuyers pursuant to a recently enacted statute, P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104 et seq.).  The bill also modifies the Resilient Home Construction Pilot Program (construction program), established to provide funding for developers to rehabilitate existing homes and construct new affordable homes for sale, changing it from a pilot program to a permanent program in the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (agency).  The bill ensures that a portion of the funding for the loan program and construction program, respectively, is to be allocated to provide down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers to purchase starter homes and affordable starter homes, and funding for developers to construct starter homes and affordable starter homes, as those terms are defined in the bill by size and formal price control. In addition to the loan awards already offered through the loan program, the bill authorizes the agency to provide an additional zero-interest, forgivable loan award of up to $5,000 if the first-time homebuyer provides matching down payment funds in an amount to be determined by the Executive Director of the agency. The bill also establishes a revolving fund in the agency, to be known as the Community Investment Fund, for carrying out the purposes of the loan program (fund), and permits moneys held in the fund that are not able to be disbursed immediately to be invested and reinvested.  The bill requires that a portion of the money expended from the fund for the loan program be used for down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers to purchase starter homes and affordable starter homes. Sections 7 through 11 of the bill would take effect immediately. Shortened Timeframe for Land Use Applications for Development and Expedited Inspections for Starter Homes: Sections 12 through 16 of the bill reduce certain allowed timeframes under the "Municipal Land Use Law," P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) related to the approval of an application for development, an application for certain site plans, or for an application for certain subdivisions, if at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, total acreage, or lots on which residential dwellings are constructed, are to be used for starter homes. Further, for the inspection of any work related to the construction or development of a starter home, the bill permits an owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work to contract with and utilize a private on-site inspection agency authorized by the department to conduct on-site inspections, and further permits the private on-site inspection agency to perform any requested inspections related to the development of a starter home, regardless of whether the enforcing agency is able to perform a requested inspection within three business days of the date for which the inspection is requested.  Sections 12 through 16 of the bill would take effect immediately. Buyers Home Purchasing Guide and Institutional Investment Impacts Public Awareness Campaign: Sections 17 and 18 of the bill require the Department of Banking and Insurance, in consultation with the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency and the Department of Community Affairs, to: (1)   publish and disseminate a buyers guide for individuals who are purchasing a home; and (2)   undertake a public awareness campaign concerning the impacts of institutional investment in the State housing market and to promote resources available for homebuyers. Sections 17 and 18 of the bill would take effect immediately. Tax Incentives for Individual Homebuyers: Sections 19 through 22 of the bill permit resident taxpayers of this State who are first-time home buyers to claim a gross income tax deduction for certain expenses. Specifically, the bill allows a resident taxpayer who is a first-time home buyer, as defined in the bill, to claim a gross income tax deduction for the amount paid by the taxpayer as a down payment for the purchase of a single-family residence during the taxable year.  The bill also allows a first-time home buyer to claim a gross income tax deduction for the amount of mortgage interest paid by the taxpayer to an eligible lender during the taxable year, up to amounts allowable under the federal Internal Revenue Code, on a single-family residence that is purchased and occupied as the owners primary residence.  If applicable, a first-time home buyer would also be allowed to claim a gross income tax deduction for any mortgage insurance payments paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year, up to $3,000. Sections 19 through 22 of the bill would take effect immediately, and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of the year next following enactment. Tax Disincentives for Business Entities Owning Single-Family Residences: Sections 23 and 24 of the bill prohibit certain business entities from claiming deductions or expenses under the corporation business tax and gross income tax for depreciation allowances and business interest expenses related to single family residences owned by the business. Under the bill, a corporation business taxpayer that owns more than 20 single-family residences, as defined in the bill, during the privilege period would be required to include the amounts of certain deductions specified in the bill, if claimed for federal income tax purposes in connection with a single-family residence owned by the taxpayer, to the taxpayers entire net income for the privilege period.  The bill also prohibits the taxpayer from claiming a deduction for depreciation in relation to single-family residence ownership. Additionally, business interest expenses and depreciation deductions related to single family residences owned by certain pass-through business entities, which own more than 20 single-family residences, are not to be included in the calculation of the various categories of business income, which are calculated net of expenses. As a result, the taxable income generated by these business entities would not be reduced based on these expenses and deductions. Sections 23 and 24 of the bill would take effect immediately, and apply to privilege periods and taxable years beginning on or after the January 1 following the date of enactment. Starter Home Development Incentive Program: Sections 25 through 28 of the bill establish the "Starter Home Development Incentive Program" (incentive program) within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA). The purpose of the incentive program is to attract developer investment in the development of starter homes in the State.  Under the bill, "starter home" means a unit of single-family housing that consists of not more than 1,800 square feet of floor area.  The bill defines a "single-family home" as a one- to four-family residence, a condominium unit, or a cooperative unit. Under the program, the EDA would provide tax credits to eligible developers, following the approval of an application by the EDA.  Eligible projects would include projects that primarily include the construction or rehabilitation of one or more starter homes.  Under the bill, projects that include at least 10 starter homes would receive a tax credit in the amount of 30 percent of the developers eligible project costs, whereas projects that include less than 10 starter homes would receive a tax credit in the amount of 20 percent of the developers eligible project costs.  Under the bill, "eligible project costs" means the costs to complete the development of an eligible project, which costs are eligible for subsidy pursuant to the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, and which costs are incurred by a developer before the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy for the eligible project, or before such other time specified by the EDA. The bill provides that an eligible developer that executes an incentive award agreement with the EDA may receive tax credits as authorized under the agreement, subject to the approval of annual compliance reports submitted by the developer to the EDA. After issuance of the certificate of compliance by the EDA, the taxpayer would be permitted to claim the tax credit.  Any amount of tax credit that cannot be used on a tax period may be carried forward for use in the seven tax periods following the period for which the credit was issued.  The bill also allows a taxpayer to apply for a tax credit transfer certificate so that all or part of the credit awarded may be sold or assigned to a third-party purchaser, as provided for in the bill. Sections 25 through 28 of the bill would take effect immediately.

S4615 SENATE, No. 4615 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 19, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  BENJIE E. WIMBERLY District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) Senator  ANGELA V. MCKNIGHT District 31 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS "Protection of Homeownership and Limiting Institutional Investor Acquisition Act"; imposes limitations and establishes certain incentives and disincentives concerning acquisition of single-family residences. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act promoting family homeownership, including through restrictions, assistance, and tax incentives and disincentives related to single-family residences, and supplementing and amending various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the "Protection of Homeownership and Limiting Institutional Investor Acquisition Act." 2.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The Great Recession of 2008-2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to fundamental changes in the real estate market and facilitated a dramatic transfer of wealth from low-, moderate-, and middle-income households to the wealthy, due in substantial part to the surge of institutional investors in the residential real estate market that purchase and convert substantial numbers of single-family homes into rental properties; b.    Single-family homes purchased by institutional investors may be completely taken off the market for individual homebuyers, leading to the concentration of single-family homes, capital, and market power in the hands of large institutional investors; c.     Institutional investors thereby cripple the ability of individual homebuyers to compete with and purchase single-family homes, since institutional investors have a ready supply of capital, high liquidity, and significant bargaining power compared to individual homebuyers; d.    Homeownership, which commonly begins with the purchase of a small- or moderate-sized single-family home, or starter home, is essential for building wealth and for retirement, including through equity, tax deduction incentives, and capital gains exclusions on sales, and therefore provides for generational wealth; e.     The influx of institutional investors in the real estate market has contributed to the increase in the cost of living, which has skyrocketed since 2008, making the American dream of homeownership unattainable for many; f.     While an October 2022 study, entitled "Buying New Jersey: The Rise of Institutional Ownership of Residential Properties," produced by the Office of Policy and External Affairs in the Department of Community Affairs, observed that approximately six percent of residential properties were institutionally owned as of 2020, institutional investors wield a tremendous amount of market power at significantly lower market shares; g.  The unique structure of the housing market enables institutional investors, through their purchasing behavior, to manipulate both supply and demand in the markets for single-family home sales and single-family home rentals; h.    To account for the gross imbalance in market power between institutional investors and individual homebuyers in New Jersey, it is critical for legislative responses to not only place reasonable restrictions on the ability of institutional investors to dominate the residential real estate market, but also to increase the power of individual homebuyers to compete with institutional investors; and i.     Therefore, it is necessary and proper for the Legislature to place reasonable restrictions on institutional investors related to the purchase of single-family homes; impose tax incentives and disincentives on certain acquisitions by institutional investors to help stabilize homeownership opportunities for New Jersey families; provide additional down payment assistance for individual homebuyers for the purchase of starter homes; expedite the production of single-family and starter homes by reducing certain statutory and regulatory impediments; provide tax incentives for the development of single-family and starter homes; and enable individual New Jersey homebuyers to claim certain gross income tax deductions. 3.    (New section)  As used in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): "Affordable housing" means an inclusionary development, as defined pursuant to subsection f. of section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304), and other low- and moderate-income housing.

Of the total amount of down payment assistance funding awarded each State fiscal year through the loan program, no less than 50 percent shall be awarded to first-generation homebuyers, unless the agency determines that 50 percent of the down payment assistance funding cannot be awarded to first-generation homebuyers, because too few first-generation homebuyers have applied for the loan program, in which case, more than 50 percent of the funding shall be awarded to first-time homebuyers who are not first-generation homebuyers. g.  No later than the 730th day next following the effective date of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104 et al.), the agency shall prepare and submit a report to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature.  The report shall analyze the efficacy of the loan program.  The report shall provide an overview of the total amount of down payment assistance provided by the agency, with information by census tract on the race and ethnicity of the recipients of assistance.  The report also shall analyze: (1)  the impact of the down payment assistance on the total housing costs of the recipients of such assistance; (2)  the impact of the additional loan award for first-generation homebuyers provided pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section, and the other components of the loan program, on first-generation homeownership; and (3)  any other information determined by the agency to be relevant to the costs and benefits of the loan program.

The vote on any such resolution shall be deemed to be a memorialization of the action of the municipal agency and not to be an action of the municipal agency; however, the date of the adoption of the resolution shall constitute the date of the decision for purposes of the mailings, filings and publications required by subsections h. and i. of this section [(C.40:55D-10)].  If the municipal agency fails to adopt a resolution or memorializing resolution as hereinabove specified, any interested party may apply to the Superior Court in a summary manner for an order compelling the municipal agency to reduce its findings and conclusions to writing within a stated time, and the cost of the application, including attorney's fees, shall be assessed against the municipality. h.    A copy of the decision shall be mailed by the municipal agency within 10 days of the date of decision to the applicant or, if represented, then to his attorney, without separate charge, and to all who request a copy of the decision, for a reasonable fee.  A copy of the decision shall also be filed by the municipal agency in the office of the administrative officer.  The administrative officer shall make a copy of such filed decision available to any interested party for a reasonable fee and available for public inspection at his office during reasonable hours i.     A brief notice of the decision shall be published in the official newspaper of the municipality, if there be one, or in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality.  Such publication shall be arranged by the applicant unless a particular municipal officer is so designated by ordinance; provided that nothing contained in [this act] P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) shall be construed as preventing the applicant from arranging such publication if he so desires.  The municipality may make a reasonable charge for its publication.  The period of time in which an appeal of the decision may be made shall run from the first publication of the decision, whether arranged by the municipality or the applicant. (cf: P.L.2004, c.42, s.5) 13.  Section 34 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-46) is amended to read as follows: a.

If any architectural plans are required to be submitted for site plan approval, the preliminary plans and elevations shall be sufficient. b. If the planning board required any substantial amendment in the layout of improvements proposed by the developer that have been the subject of a hearing, an amended application for development shall be submitted and proceeded upon, as in the case of the original application for development.  The planning board shall, if the proposed development complies with the ordinance and [this act] P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.), grant preliminary site plan approval. c. Upon the submission to the administrative officer of a complete application for a site plan which involves 10 acres of land or less, and 10 dwelling units or less, the planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within 45 days, or 30 days for such an application, for which at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, 40 percent of the lots on which residential dwellings are to be constructed, or 40 percent of the total acreage, is to be used for the construction and development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), of the date of such submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer.  Upon the submission of a complete application for a site plan which involves more than 10 acres, or more than 10 dwelling units, the planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within 95 days, or 60 days for such an application, for which at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, 40 percent of the lots on which residential dwellings are to be constructed, or 40 percent of the total acreage, is to be used for the construction and development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), of the date of such submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer.  Otherwise, the planning board shall be deemed to have granted preliminary approval of the site plan.

Minor site plan approval shall be deemed to be final approval of the site plan by the board, provided that the board or said subcommittee may condition such approval on terms ensuring the provision of improvements pursuant to sections 29, 29.1, 29.3 and 41 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-38, 40:55D-39, 40:55D-41 and 40:55D-53). a.

Whenever review or approval of the application by the county planning board is required by section 8 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.6), the municipal planning board shall condition any approval that it grants upon timely receipt of a favorable report on the application by the county planning board or approval by the county planning board by its failure to report thereon within the required time period. c. The zoning requirements and general terms and conditions, whether conditional or otherwise, upon which minor site plan approval was granted, shall not be changed for a period of two years after the date of minor site plan approval. The planning board shall grant an extension of this period for a period determined by the board but not exceeding one year from what would otherwise be the expiration date, if the developer proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the board that the developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with the development because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other governmental entities and that the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued the approvals.  A developer shall apply for this extension before: (1) what would otherwise be the expiration date, or (2) the 91st day after the date on which the developer receives the last of the legally required approvals from the other governmental entities, whichever occurs later. (cf: P.L.1991, c.256, s.8) 15.  Section 36 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-48) is amended to read as follows: a.     An ordinance requiring subdivision approval by the planning board shall require that the developer submit to the administrative officer a plat and such other information as is reasonably necessary to make an informed decision as to whether the requirements necessary for preliminary approval have been met; provided that minor subdivisions pursuant to section 35 of [this act] P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-47) shall not be subject to this section.  The plat and any other engineering documents to be submitted shall be required in tentative form for discussion purposes for preliminary approval. b.    If the planning board required any substantial amendment in the layout of improvements proposed by the developer that have been the subject of a hearing, an amended application shall be submitted and proceeded upon, as in the case of the original application for development.  The planning board shall, if the proposed subdivision complies with the ordinance and [this act] P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.), grant preliminary approval to the subdivision. c.     Upon the submission to the administrative officer of a complete application for a subdivision of 10 or fewer lots, the planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within 45 days, or 30 days for a complete application for a subdivision of 10 or fewer lots for which at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, 40 percent of the lots on which residential dwellings are to be constructed, or 40 percent of the total acreage, is to be used for the construction and development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), of the date of such submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer.  Upon the submission of a complete application for a subdivision of more than 10 lots, the planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within 95 days, or 60 days for a complete application for a subdivision of more than 10 lots for which at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, 40 percent of the lots on which residential dwellings are to be constructed, or 40 percent of the total acreage, is to be used for the construction and development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), of the date of such submission or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer.  Otherwise, the planning board shall be deemed to have granted preliminary approval to the subdivision.

enforcing agency and the department, of the entire premises and of any and all construction being performed on it until a certificate of occupancy has been issued.  An inspector, or team of inspectors, on presentation of proper credentials, shall have the right to enter and inspect such premises, and any and all construction thereon, for purposes of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the applicable construction permit, the code, and other applicable laws and regulations.  All inspection pursuant to P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.) shall be between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on business days or at another time that has been agreed upon by the owner and the relevant inspecting entity, whether the enforcing agency, department, or private on-site inspection agency, or when construction is actually being undertaken, provided, however, that inspections may be conducted at other times if the enforcing agency has reasonable cause to believe that an immediate danger to life, limb or property exists, or if permission is given by an owner, or the owner's agent, architect, engineer or builder.  No person shall accompany an inspector or team of inspectors on any inspection pursuant to P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), unless the person's presence is necessary for the enforcement of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), or the code, or unless consent is given by an owner or the owner's agent, architect, engineer or builder. c.     If the construction of a structure or building is being undertaken contrary to the provisions of a construction permit, P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), the code, or other applicable laws or ordinances, the enforcing agency may issue a stop construction order in writing which shall state the

construction is not known, or cannot be located with reasonable effort, the notice may be delivered to the person in charge of, or apparently in charge of, the construction.  No person shall continue, or cause or allow to be continued, the construction of a building or structure in violation of a stop construction order, except with the permission of the enforcing agency to abate a dangerous condition or remove a violation, or except by court order.  If an order to stop construction is not obeyed, the enforcing agency may apply to the appropriate court as otherwise established by law for an order enjoining the violation of the stop construction order.  The remedy for violation of such an order provided in this subsection shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedies provided by law or ordinance. d.    When an inspector or team of inspectors finds a violation of the provisions of a construction permit, the code, or other applicable laws and regulations at an owner-occupied single-family residence, and issues a notice of violation and an order to terminate the violation, the enforcing agency shall require the same inspector or team of inspectors who found the violation to undertake any subsequent reinspection thereof at the premises.  When the same inspector or team of inspectors cannot be assigned to undertake the reinspection, the enforcing agency may assign an available inspector provided the scope of the reinspection shall be limited to the violation for which the reinspection is required.  The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to violations of the plumbing or electrical subcodes, or to fire safety code violations, or to any violation of any other subcode that the Department of Community Affairs determines to be a health or safety violation.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to infringe upon the right of a property owner to request a different inspector, team of inspectors, or supervisor, to perform any required reinspection. e.     The owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work shall notify the enforcing agency when the work is ready for any required inspection under the code.  This notice shall be given in writing at least 24 hours prior to the date and time requested for the inspection.  The enforcing agency shall perform an inspection within three business days of the date for which the inspection is requested.  The owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work may provide oral notice for inspections of minor work projects, as defined by the code. (1)   The owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work shall be present and prepared at the time of any inspection that has been scheduled upon the owner, agent, or other responsible person's request.  A failure by the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work to be present and prepared for inspection shall be considered a failed inspection. (2)   If the enforcing agency is unable to perform a requested inspection within three business days of the date for which the inspection is requested, the enforcing agency shall inform the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work in writing within 24 hours of receiving the request, at which time the enforcing agency and the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work may agree to a different date and time for inspection.  The enforcing agency shall commit the agreed upon inspection date to writing and provide a copy to the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work. (3)   If the enforcing agency is unable to perform the requested inspection within three business days of the date for which the inspection is requested and the enforcing agency and the owner, agent, or responsible person in charge of work are unable to come to an agreement pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work may choose to contract with a private on-site inspection agency authorized by the department to conduct on-site inspections pursuant to paragraph i. of section 6 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-124) to perform the requested inspection or inspections. (a)   The owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work shall notify the enforcing agency in writing of any choice to utilize an authorized private on-site inspection agency to conduct the requested inspection or inspections. (b)   The owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work may elect to utilize the private on-site inspection agency to conduct all subsequent associated inspections.  In the event of a project with multiple units in one building, this provision shall apply to the specific unit or units affected by the inspection delay. (c)   The use of a private on-site inspection agency by an owner, agent, or other responsible person for on-site inspections shall be subject to the conflict-of-interest provisions in the code.  In addition to those requirements, no private on-site inspection agency shall perform an inspection for any owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work, if an owner, agent, or other responsible person is currently employed by or affiliated with any individual affiliated with the private on-site inspection agency or has employed or was associated with an individual affiliated with the private on-site inspection agency within a timeframe established by the commissioner by regulation. (d)   The enforcing agency shall, if warranted, provide a fee reconciliation to the owner for an inspection completed by a private on-site inspection agency as a result of a missed inspection.  The enforcing agency shall perform the reconciliation at the conclusion of the project.  This reconciliation shall be based on the fees already paid less administrative costs for the enforcing agency and shall not exceed the amount already paid for the project, nor shall it exceed the amount that the enforcing agency is authorized to impose for inspections, and shall take into account the administrative costs of the enforcing agency. (4)   If the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work believes an enforcing agency has demonstrated a repeated inability to conduct inspections for a construction project within the timelines required by this section, as established by the commissioner by regulation, the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work may notify the department in writing to request authorization to utilize an authorized private on-site inspection agency.  Within 15 business days of receiving a notification under this paragraph, the department shall determine whether the enforcing agency has demonstrated repeated inability, and, if the department determines, shall authorize the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work to utilize an authorized private on-site inspection agency for all or a portion of the necessary inspections for the remainder of the project. f.     Each enforcing agency shall establish a process for ensuring inspections are performed within three business days of a requested inspection date, as required by subsection e. of this section.  Authorized processes include, but are not limited to, the use of supplemental shared services agreements with other municipalities or enforcing agencies or the use of contracted private on-site inspection agencies, including supplemental private on-site inspection agencies. g. (1)  At timeframes established by the commissioner by regulation, adopted in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the municipal construction official shall submit an annual report detailing compliance with the code.  The report shall include, at a minimum information related to the staffing, staff titles, and expenses of the enforcing agency, in addition to any other information required by the commissioner.  The annual report shall take into account projected work and agency resource needs for the next budget year. (2)   A municipality that enters into a contract for supplemental services pursuant to subsection f. of this section shall provide a copy of the contract to the department upon entering into the contract. (3)   The information required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, in addition to the inspection log, the municipal monthly activity reports, and the fee schedule shall be maintained by the municipal construction official or enforcing agency, and the municipal construction official or enforcing agency shall make the information and documents described in this paragraph available to the department upon request. (4)   The department may utilize the information provided pursuant to this subsection to determine appropriate staffing levels for the enforcing agency.  If the department determines that an enforcing agency has not maintained appropriate staffing levels, the department may require the municipality to take corrective actions to ensure that the enforcing agency's staffing needs are met. (5)   The department may take corrective action, including the issuance of penalties, pursuant to subsection k. of section 6 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-124), if an enforcing agency fails to maintain or provide the information required by this subsection or maintain appropriate staffing levels, as determined by the department pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection. h.    If an enforcing agency is unable to meet its obligations under P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), the enforcing agency shall promptly notify the department within 15 business days.  The department may take corrective action, including the issuance of penalties, pursuant to subsection k. of section 6 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-124) if an enforcing agency fails to meet its obligations under P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.). i.     Notwithstanding any provision of subsection e. of this section to the contrary, the owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work, for an inspection of any work related to the construction or development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), may elect to contract with and utilize a private on-site inspection agency authorized by the department to conduct on-site inspections pursuant to subsection i. of section 6 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-124) to perform any requested inspection or inspections related to the construction or development of a starter home, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104), regardless of whether the enforcing agency is able to perform a requested inspection within three business days of the date for which the inspection is requested.

(2)   The tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by the developer from the director and the chief executive officer of the authority, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part in an amount not less than $25,000, in the tax period during which the developer receives the tax credit transfer certificate from the director, to another person, who may apply the credit against a tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5.  The certificate provided to the developer shall include a statement waiving the developer's right to claim the amount of the credit that the developer has elected to sell or assign against the developer's tax liability. e.     (1)  The developer shall not sell or assign, including a collateral assignment, a tax credit transfer certificate allowed under this section for consideration received by the developer of less than 85 percent of the transferred credit amount before considering any further discounting to present value which shall be permitted. The tax credit transfer certificate issued to a developer by the director shall be subject to any limitations and conditions imposed on the application of State tax credits pursuant to sections 25 through 28 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        through ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and any other terms and conditions that the director may prescribe, provided, however, that the holder of a tax credit certificate may transfer all or part of the tax credit amount, on or after the date of issuance of the tax credit transfer certificate, for use by the transferee in the tax period for which it was issued, in the tax period in which it was issued, or in any of the next three successive tax periods.  The tax certificate holder or transferee may first use the credit against tax liabilities in the tax period in which it was issued or in a succeeding tax period, as authorized in this subsection, without the need to amend the tax return for the tax period for which the credit was issued, subject to the provisions of this section.  A transferee may carry forward an unused credit for use in any of the next five successive tax periods, and the unused credit shall expire thereafter.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the amount of tax credits that may be claimed by the transferee in any tax period shall not exceed the total tax credit amount divided by the duration of the eligibility period in years. (2)   A purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate pursuant to this section shall not make any subsequent transfers, assignments, or sales of the tax credit transfer certificate. (3)   The authority shall publish on its Internet website the following information concerning each tax credit transfer certificate approved by the authority and the director pursuant to this section: (a)   the name of the transferor; (b)   the name of the transferee; (c)   the value of the tax credit transfer certificate; and (d)   the consideration received by the transferor. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the chief executive officer of the authority, in consultation with the executive director and the commissioner, shall adopt, immediately, upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, such rules and regulations as the chief executive officer deems necessary to implement the provisions of sections 25 through 28 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        through ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which rules and regulations shall be effective for a period not to exceed 365 days after the date of the filing.  Before the expiration of the rules and regulations, the chief executive officer, in consultation with the executive director and the commissioner, shall amend, adopt, or readopt the rules and regulations in accordance with the requirements of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 29.  a.  Sections 1 through 6 of P.L.    , c.

STATEMENT This bill, the "Protection of Homeownership and Limiting Institutional Investor Acquisition Act": (1) restricts institutional investor acquisition of single-family homes and imposes certain tax penalties on acquisition of single-family homes by institutional investors; (2) provides down payment assistance and funding for certain homebuyers and developers for the purchase and development of starter homes; (3) reduces the timeframe for the approval of development applications to certain municipal government entities, and expedites starter home inspections; (4) requires the creation of a buyers home purchasing guide and establishment of a public awareness campaign concerning the impact of institutional investors on the housing market; (5) permits resident taxpayers who are first-time homebuyers to claim certain gross income tax deductions; and (6) establishes the "Starter Home Development Incentive Program" within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. Restrictions on Institutional Investor Acquisition of Single-Family Homes and Imposition of Certain Tax Penalties: Sections 3 through 6 of the bill prohibit certain institutional investors from placing a bid on or purchasing a single-family home during the first 90 days that the home is available, and subject an institutional investor who owns or acquires a single-family home to certain taxes. Specifically, the bill prohibits an institutional investor, as defined in the bill, from contacting the owner of a single-family home, or the owners agent, with respect to the single-family home, or soliciting, placing a bid on, or inducing an offer for, a single-family home during the first 90 days that the single-family home is "on the market and available for purchase," as the term is defined in the bill.  To discourage circumvention of the bill by institutional investors, the bill provides that an institutional investor that places a bid on, acquires, or purchases a single-family home outside of the 90-day period set forth in the bill is to be subject to an annual State tax in an amount equal to the product of $25,000, and the number of single-family homes owned by the institutional investor as of the last day of the tax year.  The State tax revenue collected through the tax is to be credited to the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency to establish new programs or supplement existing programs that award grants to provide down payment assistance to families purchasing single-family homes in the State.  The bill authorizes the Director of the Division of Taxation (director) and the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) to require institutional investors to report certain information provided in the bill.  The bill also prohibits an institutional investor from leasing a single-family home acquired or purchased by the institutional investor for a period of five years following the date of acquisition or purchase. The bill would not apply to certain nonprofit organizations; small institutional investors, as defined in the bill; financial institutions owning or acquiring a single-family home through foreclosure or through a secured transaction; institutional investors acting as condemnors; governmental authorities; or other institutional investors excepted from the requirements of the bill by the commissioner.  An institutional investor that violates the bill is to be required to alienate the single-family home within six months of acquisition, and any profit received is to be payable to the Attorney General.  A violation of the bill is to also constitute an unlawful practice in violation of the New Jersey consumer fraud act.   Further, notwithstanding a penalty collected by the Attorney General pursuant to the bill, the bill permits any person or entity directly and adversely affected by a violation to file a complaint against an institutional investor in violation of the bill.  The complainant would be permitted to recover $20,000, which is required to be proportionately divided amongst any person or entity, including a small institutional investor, directly and adversely affected by a violation who filed a complaint within 24 months of the date that the violation occurred, in addition to certain fees and expenses incurred in proving a violation of the bill. This portion of the bill would take effect on the first day of the sixth month next following the date of enactment, and sections 5 and 6 of the bill would apply to the tax year beginning on or after January 1 following the date of enactment. Down Payment Assistance, Developer Funding, and the Community Investment Fund: Sections 7 through 11 of the bill provide down payment assistance and developer funding for the purchase and development of starter homes and affordable starter homes. The bill modifies a down payment assistance loan program (loan program), established for the benefit of first-time homebuyers pursuant to a recently enacted statute, P.L.2023, c.78 (C.55:14K-104 et seq.).  The bill also modifies the Resilient Home Construction Pilot Program (construction program), established to provide funding for developers to rehabilitate existing homes and construct new affordable homes for sale, changing it from a pilot program to a permanent program in the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (agency).  The bill ensures that a portion of the funding for the loan program and construction program, respectively, is to be allocated to provide down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers to purchase starter homes and affordable starter homes, and funding for developers to construct starter homes and affordable starter homes, as those terms are defined in the bill by size and formal price control. In addition to the loan awards already offered through the loan program, the bill authorizes the agency to provide an additional zero-interest, forgivable loan award of up to $5,000 if the first-time homebuyer provides matching down payment funds in an amount to be determined by the Executive Director of the agency. The bill also establishes a revolving fund in the agency, to be known as the Community Investment Fund, for carrying out the purposes of the loan program (fund), and permits moneys held in the fund that are not able to be disbursed immediately to be invested and reinvested.  The bill requires that a portion of the money expended from the fund for the loan program be used for down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers to purchase starter homes and affordable starter homes. Sections 7 through 11 of the bill would take effect immediately. Shortened Timeframe for Land Use Applications for Development and Expedited Inspections for Starter Homes: Sections 12 through 16 of the bill reduce certain allowed timeframes under the "Municipal Land Use Law," P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) related to the approval of an application for development, an application for certain site plans, or for an application for certain subdivisions, if at least 40 percent of the units to be developed, total acreage, or lots on which residential dwellings are constructed, are to be used for starter homes. Further, for the inspection of any work related to the construction or development of a starter home, the bill permits an owner, agent, or other responsible person in charge of work to contract with and utilize a private on-site inspection agency authorized by the department to conduct on-site inspections, and further permits the private on-site inspection agency to perform any requested inspections related to the development of a starter home, regardless of whether the enforcing agency is able to perform a requested inspection within three business days of the date for which the inspection is requested.  Sections 12 through 16 of the bill would take effect immediately. Buyers Home Purchasing Guide and Institutional Investment Impacts Public Awareness Campaign: Sections 17 and 18 of the bill require the Department of Banking and Insurance, in consultation with the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency and the Department of Community Affairs, to: (1)   publish and disseminate a buyers guide for individuals who are purchasing a home; and (2)   undertake a public awareness campaign concerning the impacts of institutional investment in the State housing market and to promote resources available for homebuyers. Sections 17 and 18 of the bill would take effect immediately. Tax Incentives for Individual Homebuyers: Sections 19 through 22 of the bill permit resident taxpayers of this State who are first-time home buyers to claim a gross income tax deduction for certain expenses. Specifically, the bill allows a resident taxpayer who is a first-time home buyer, as defined in the bill, to claim a gross income tax deduction for the amount paid by the taxpayer as a down payment for the purchase of a single-family residence during the taxable year.  The bill also allows a first-time home buyer to claim a gross income tax deduction for the amount of mortgage interest paid by the taxpayer to an eligible lender during the taxable year, up to amounts allowable under the federal Internal Revenue Code, on a single-family residence that is purchased and occupied as the owners primary residence.  If applicable, a first-time home buyer would also be allowed to claim a gross income tax deduction for any mortgage insurance payments paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year, up to $3,000. Sections 19 through 22 of the bill would take effect immediately, and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of the year next following enactment. Tax Disincentives for Business Entities Owning Single-Family Residences: Sections 23 and 24 of the bill prohibit certain business entities from claiming deductions or expenses under the corporation business tax and gross income tax for depreciation allowances and business interest expenses related to single family residences owned by the business. Under the bill, a corporation business taxpayer that owns more than 20 single-family residences, as defined in the bill, during the privilege period would be required to include the amounts of certain deductions specified in the bill, if claimed for federal income tax purposes in connection with a single-family residence owned by the taxpayer, to the taxpayers entire net income for the privilege period.  The bill also prohibits the taxpayer from claiming a deduction for depreciation in relation to single-family residence ownership. Additionally, business interest expenses and depreciation deductions related to single family residences owned by certain pass-through business entities, which own more than 20 single-family residences, are not to be included in the calculation of the various categories of business income, which are calculated net of expenses. As a result, the taxable income generated by these business entities would not be reduced based on these expenses and deductions. Sections 23 and 24 of the bill would take effect immediately, and apply to privilege periods and taxable years beginning on or after the January 1 following the date of enactment. Starter Home Development Incentive Program: Sections 25 through 28 of the bill establish the "Starter Home Development Incentive Program" (incentive program) within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA). The purpose of the incentive program is to attract developer investment in the development of starter homes in the State.  Under the bill, "starter home" means a unit of single-family housing that consists of not more than 1,800 square feet of floor area.  The bill defines a "single-family home" as a one- to four-family residence, a condominium unit, or a cooperative unit. Under the program, the EDA would provide tax credits to eligible developers, following the approval of an application by the EDA.  Eligible projects would include projects that primarily include the construction or rehabilitation of one or more starter homes.  Under the bill, projects that include at least 10 starter homes would receive a tax credit in the amount of 30 percent of the developers eligible project costs, whereas projects that include less than 10 starter homes would receive a tax credit in the amount of 20 percent of the developers eligible project costs.  Under the bill, "eligible project costs" means the costs to complete the development of an eligible project, which costs are eligible for subsidy pursuant to the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, and which costs are incurred by a developer before the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy for the eligible project, or before such other time specified by the EDA. The bill provides that an eligible developer that executes an incentive award agreement with the EDA may receive tax credits as authorized under the agreement, subject to the approval of annual compliance reports submitted by the developer to the EDA. After issuance of the certificate of compliance by the EDA, the taxpayer would be permitted to claim the tax credit.  Any amount of tax credit that cannot be used on a tax period may be carried forward for use in the seven tax periods following the period for which the credit was issued.  The bill also allows a taxpayer to apply for a tax credit transfer certificate so that all or part of the credit awarded may be sold or assigned to a third-party purchaser, as provided for in the bill. Sections 25 through 28 of the bill would take effect immediately.
