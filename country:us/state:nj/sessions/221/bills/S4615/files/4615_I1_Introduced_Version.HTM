section)  P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this
bill) shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;Protection of Homeownership
and Limiting Institutional Investor Acquisition Act.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     2.    (New
section)  The Legislature finds and declares that:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     a.     The
Great Recession of 2008-2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to
fundamental changes in the real estate market and facilitated a dramatic
transfer of wealth from low-, moderate-, and middle-income households to the
wealthy, due in substantial part to the surge of institutional investors in the
residential real estate market that purchase and convert substantial numbers of
single-family homes into rental properties;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     b.    Single-family
homes purchased by institutional investors may be completely taken off the
market for individual homebuyers, leading to the concentration of single-family
homes, capital, and market power in the hands of large institutional investors;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     c.     Institutional
investors thereby cripple the ability of individual homebuyers to compete with
and purchase single-family homes, since institutional investors have a ready
supply of capital, high liquidity, and significant bargaining power compared to
individual homebuyers;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     d.    Homeownership,
which commonly begins with the purchase of a small- or moderate-sized
single-family home, or starter home, is essential for building wealth and for
retirement, including through equity, tax deduction incentives, and capital
gains exclusions on sales, and therefore provides for generational wealth;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     e.     The
influx of institutional investors in the real estate market has contributed to
the increase in the cost of living, which has skyrocketed since 2008, making
the American dream of homeownership unattainable for many;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     f.     </span>While
an October 2022 study, entitled <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>&quot;</span>Buying
New Jersey: The Rise of Institutional Ownership of Residential Properties,<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>&quot;</span> produced by the Office of Policy and
External Affairs in the Department of Community Affairs, observed that
approximately six percent of residential properties were institutionally owned
as of 2020, institutional investors wield a tremendous amount of market power
at significantly lower market shares; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  The unique structure of
the housing market enables institutional investors, through their purchasing
behavior, to manipulate both supply and demand in the markets for single-family
home sales and single-family home rentals; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    To account for the gross
imbalance in market power between institutional investors and individual
homebuyers in New Jersey, it is critical for legislative responses to not only
place reasonable restrictions on the ability of institutional investors to
dominate the residential real estate market, but also to increase the power of
individual homebuyers to compete with institutional investors; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Therefore, it is
necessary and proper for the Legislature to place reasonable restrictions on
institutional investors related to the purchase of single-family homes; impose
tax incentives and disincentives on certain acquisitions by institutional
investors to help stabilize homeownership opportunities for New Jersey
families; provide additional down payment assistance for individual homebuyers
for the purchase of starter homes; expedite the production of single-family and
starter homes by reducing certain statutory and regulatory impediments; provide
tax incentives for the development of single-family and starter homes; and
enable individual New Jersey homebuyers to claim certain gross income tax
deductions.</p>

the owner of a single-family home, or the owners agent, with respect to the
single-family home, or soliciting, placing a bid on, or inducing an offer for,
a single-family home <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>during the first 90 days
that the single-family home is &quot;on the market and available for
purchase,&quot; as the term is defined in the bill.  To discourage
circumvention of the bill by institutional investors, the bill provides that an
institutional investor that places a bid on, acquires, or purchases a
single-family home outside of the 90-day period set forth in the bill is to be
subject to </span>an annual State tax in an amount equal to the product of
$25,000, and the number of single-family homes owned by the institutional
investor as of the last day of the tax year.  The State tax revenue collected
through the tax is to be credited to the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage
Finance Agency to establish new programs or supplement existing programs that
award grants to provide down payment assistance to families purchasing
single-family homes in the State.  The bill authorizes the Director of the
Division of Taxation (director) and the Commissioner of Community Affairs
(commissioner) to require institutional investors to report certain information
provided in the bill.  <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The bill also prohibits
an institutional investor from leasing a single-family home acquired or

other institutional investors excepted from the requirements of the bill by the
commissioner.  </span>An <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>institutional
investor that violates the bill is to be required to alienate the single-family
home within six months of acquisition, and any profit received is to be payable
to the Attorney General.  A violation of the bill is to also constitute an
unlawful practice in violation of the New Jersey consumer fraud act.   Further,
notwithstanding a penalty collected by the Attorney General pursuant to the
bill, the bill permits any person or entity directly and adversely affected by
a violation to file a complaint against an institutional investor in violation
of the bill.  The complainant would be permitted to recover $20,000, which is
required to be proportionately divided amongst any person or entity, including
a small institutional investor, directly and adversely affected by a violation
who filed a complaint within 24 months of the date that the violation occurred,

Pilot Program (construction program), established to provide funding for
developers to rehabilitate existing homes and construct new affordable homes
for sale, changing it from a pilot program to a permanent program in the New
Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (agency).  The bill ensures that a
portion of the funding for the loan program and construction program,
respectively, is to be allocated to provide down payment assistance for
first-time homebuyers to purchase starter homes and affordable starter homes,

homes.  Under the bill, projects that include at least 10 starter homes would receive
a tax credit in the amount of 30 percent of the developers eligible project
costs, whereas projects that include less than 10 starter homes would receive a
tax credit in the amount of 20 percent of the developers eligible project
costs.  Under the bill, &quot;eligible project costs&quot; means the costs to
complete the development of an eligible project, which costs are eligible for
subsidy pursuant to the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, and
which costs are incurred by a developer before the issuance of a permanent
certificate of occupancy for the eligible project, or before such other time
specified by the EDA.</p>

certificate of compliance by the EDA, the taxpayer would be permitted to claim
the tax credit.  Any amount of tax credit that cannot be used on a tax period
may be carried forward for use in the seven tax periods following the period
for which the credit was issued.  The bill also allows a taxpayer to apply for
a tax credit transfer certificate so that all or part of the credit awarded may
be sold or assigned to a third-party purchaser, as provided for in the bill.</p>
