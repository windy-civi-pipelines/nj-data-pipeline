to thereby ensure that New Jersey remains economically competitive on a
regional, national and international basis; to implement programs which
effectuate the economic development goals of attracting and retaining business,
maintaining and creating jobs and enhancing the economic vitality of the State;
to achieve federal and State environmental objectives in a cost effective
manner; to promote secure energy supplies and service to end users, and the

to the traditional form of regulation and that no cross-subsidization exists
between or among classes of customers; and that the Board of Public Utilities

pursuant to the utility's levelized energy adjustment clause, levelized gas
adjustment clause, or both, as determined both upon the effective date of the
rate changes authorized by this act and as revised prospectively in accordance
with the utility's tariff filed with and approved by the board, and the
transitional energy facility assessment unit rate surcharges, hereinafter, TEFA
unit rate surcharges, determined in accordance with subsection d. of this
section, shall be increased by an amount determined by multiplying such charges
by the sales and use tax rate imposed under P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.). 
In addition to the utility's rates for service included in its tariff, for
informational purposes the tariff shall include such rates after application of
the sales and use tax authorized by this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  The utility's filing with
the board to implement the rate changes provided for by this act shall include
an analysis, description, and quantification of the effect of the changes in
rates and tax payments implemented pursuant to this act on the utility's
requirement for cash working capital, and if such requirement is less than the
cash working capital allowed for the collection and payment of unit-based
energy taxes formerly imposed pursuant to P.L.1940, c.5 (C.54:30A-49 et seq.)
in determining the utility's base rates in effect prior to the rate changes
implemented pursuant to this act, and to the extent the working capital
reduction is not offset by a reduction in net deferred taxes as provided for
below, such base rates shall be reduced by the reduction in the utility's
revenue requirement associated with the remaining reduction in the working
capital requirement not so offset, if any.  The reduction in working capital
shall be determined by using the same methodology employed in establishing the
working capital allowance related to unit-based energy taxes reflected in the
utility's base rates in effect prior to the rate changes implemented pursuant
to this act.  The reduction in the utility's revenue requirement associated
with the reduced working capital requirement shall be calculated using the
utility's last overall rate of return allowed by the board, including provision
for federal income taxes and the corporation business tax implemented pursuant
to this act payable on the equity portion of the return, and shall be
implemented on the effective date of the rate changes provided for, and in the
manner set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the utility's requirement
for cash working capital is increased as a result of the changes in rates and
tax payments implemented pursuant to this act, the utility may accrue carrying
costs, calculated at its last overall rate of return allowed by the board and
applied on a simple annual interest basis without compounding, on the increased
working capital requirement and request recovery of such carrying costs in a
rate proceeding before the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The working capital-related
base rate changes and carrying cost accruals shall be subject to the board's
approval, and shall not be included in the determination of the TEFA unit tax
surcharges provided for in subsection d. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The utility's filing with the
board to implement the rate changes provided for by this act shall also include
an analysis, description and quantification of net deferred taxes.  For the
purposes of this section, net deferred taxes means deferred corporation
business taxes, net of federal deferred income taxes, associated with the tax
and rate changes implemented pursuant to this act, including deferred
corporation business tax recorded in accordance with section 4 of P.L.1945,
c.162 (C.54:10A-4), projected for the calendar year in which this act takes
effect and for each year of the tax life of the asset giving rise to the
deferred corporation business taxes pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1945, c.162
(C.54:10A-4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the change in such net
deferred taxes projected for the calendar year in which the rate changes
implemented pursuant to this act take effect is negative and if the utility's
requirement for working capital is reduced as a result of the changes in rates and
tax payments implemented pursuant to this act, the working capital-related rate
reduction that otherwise would have been implemented pursuant to this
subsection shall be treated as set forth in subparagraph (a) or (b) of this
paragraph.  For the purposes of this act, a change in net deferred taxes is
considered negative when it reduces an existing deferred tax liability or
creates a deferred tax asset on the utility's balance sheet.  An appropriate
rate adjustment for the working capital impacts of this act, reflecting all
relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the adjustment, shall be made
in the year when the earlier of the following events occur:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The year in which the
reduction in carrying costs assumed for the rate reduction for working capital
that would have been made but for this paragraph is no longer required to
offset, on a present value basis, the annual carrying costs calculated on the
accumulated balance of negative net deferred taxes projected to be recorded by
the utility, its successors and assigns, over the tax life of the single asset
account giving rise to such net deferred taxes pursuant to section 4 of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-4).  For the purposes of this subparagraph (a):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)   Carrying costs and
present values are to be computed using the weighted average after-tax rate of
return approved by the board in the utility's last base rate proceeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii) The accumulated balance
of such negative net deferred taxes shall include net deferred taxes associated
with all assets and liabilities originally placed in service by the utility and
held by the utility or a company affiliated with the utility regardless of
whether or not such assets continue to be subject to regulation by the New
Jersey Board of Public Utilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  The year in which both an
appropriate working capital adjustment and the accumulated balance of negative
deferred taxes, as described in sub-subparagraph (ii) of subparagraph (a) of
this paragraph (4), are reflected in the utility's rate base in a rate proceeding
before the board.  It is the intent of this section to fully compensate
utilities on a present value basis, for the carrying costs associated with
negative net deferred taxes arising as a result of this act, and to remit to
ratepayers any credit due them as a result of any overcompensation as may have
occurred due to the treatment of working capital and deferred taxes as set
forth herein or in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph (4). At the time the
above base rate adjustment is made, an analysis shall be made to determine if
such carrying costs have been or will be fully recovered pursuant to the intent
of this provision and any additional credit or charge to ratepayers to adjust
for ratepayer overpayments or underpayments, if any shall be addressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the change in net deferred
taxes is positive, the increase shall be added to, or increase, the reduction
in the utility's requirement for working capital if the requirement is reduced
as a result of the rate and tax payment changes implemented pursuant to this
act, or subtracted from the working capital requirement if it is increased, and
the resultant net working capital requirement shall be reflected in rates or
accrue carrying costs in the same manner as prescribed for changes in the
utility's requirement for working capital above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The deferred tax-related rate
changes or carrying cost accruals shall be subject to the board's approval and
shall not be included in the determination of the TEFA unit rate surcharges
provided for in subsection d. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d. (1) Electric and gas
utilities shall file, for the board's review and approval, initial TEFA unit
rate surcharges determined by deducting from each unit-based energy tax unit
tax rate effective January 1, 1997 the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   An amount per kilowatthour
or per therm determined by multiplying the total revenue received in the base
year from sales to which that unit tax rate would have been applicable by the
factor Ru/(1 + Ru), where Ru is the sales and use tax rate imposed under
P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) expressed as a decimal, and dividing the
result by the kilowatthours or therms billed in that unit tax rate class in the
base year; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  An amount per
kilowatthour or per therm determined by dividing the revenue that would have
been received in the base year from the inclusion, in the manner prescribed in
paragraph (2) of subsection c. of this section, of the corporation business tax
in the rates applicable to sales billed in that unit tax rate class by the
kilowatthours or therms billed in that rate class. In each case, the
determination shall reflect the effect of adjustments that affect the level of
sales and revenue, if any, as provided in subsection c. of this section.  Of
the resultant rate per kilowatthour or per therm, the portion for recovery of
the utility's transitional energy facilities assessment liability shall be
determined by multiplying such rate by the factor (1 - Rs), where Rs is the
corporation business tax rate expressed as a decimal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The TEFA unit rate surcharges
shall constitute non-bypassable wires and/or mains charges of the utility, and
shall be applied to all sales within the customer classes to which they apply,

manufacturing facility or the postconsumer material manufacturing facility and
the owner shall be refunded an amount equal to the TEFA unit rate surcharge
paid by the filing, within 30 days following the close of a calendar quarter in
which the exemption applies, of a claim with the  Director of the Division of
Taxation in the Department of the Treasury for a refund of the TEFA unit rate
surcharge paid, which refund shall be paid within  60 days of the refund claim
being filed.  Proof of claim for refund shall be made by the submission of such

sub-subparagraph (iii) of subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of subsection d. of
this section relocates the manufacturing facility to a location outside of this
State, the owner shall pay to the  director the amount of TEFA unit rate
surcharge for which an exemption shall have been allowed and refund obtained
under this section.  The State Treasurer shall notify the director of the
relocation of a manufacturing facility or a postconsumer material manufacturing
facility to a location outside of this State, and the director shall issue a
tax assessment for the recapture of tax, equal to the amount of TEFA unit rate
surcharge for which an exemption shall have been allowed and refund obtained
under this section.  The recapture of tax shall be a State tax subject to the
State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et seq., and shall be deposited in
the General Fund.</p>

wheeling service.  The TEFA components of the unit rate surcharges determined
pursuant to this subsection (the components of the surcharges remaining after
deducting the provision for corporation business tax included therein) shall be
used to determine the transitional energy facility assessment liability

or on property owned by the customer, provided that any such customer is a
State entity, school district, county, county agency, county authority,
municipality, municipal agency, or municipal authority.  The standards shall
provide that, in order to qualify for net metering aggregation, the customer
must operate a solar electric power generation system using a net metering
billing account, which system is located on property owned by the customer,
provided that: (a) the property is not land that has been actively devoted to
agricultural or horticultural use and that is valued, assessed, and taxed
pursuant to the &quot;Farmland Assessment Act of 1964,&quot; P.L.1964, c.48

planning board of a municipality in which a solar electric power generation
system is located may waive the requirement of this subparagraph (a), (b) the
system is not an on-site generation facility, (c) all of the facilities of the
single customer combined for the purpose of net metering aggregation are
facilities owned or operated by the single customer and are located within its
territorial jurisdiction except that all of the facilities of a State entity
engaged in net metering aggregation shall be located within five miles of one
another, and (d) all of those facilities are within the service territory of a
single electric public utility and are all served by the same basic generation
service provider or by the same electric power supplier.  The standards shall
provide that, in order to qualify for net metering aggregation, the customer's
solar electric power generation system shall be sized so that its annual
generation does not exceed the combined metered annual energy usage of the
qualified customer facilities, and the qualified customer facilities shall all
be in the same customer rate class under the applicable electric public utility
tariff.  For the customer's facility or property on which the solar electric
generation system is installed, the electricity generated from the customer's
solar electric generation system shall be accounted for pursuant to the
provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection to provide that the electricity
generated in excess of the electricity supplied by the electric power supplier
or the basic generation service provider, as the case may be, for the
customer's facility on which the solar electric generation system is installed,
over the annualized period, is credited at the electric power supplier's or the
basic generation service provider's avoided cost of wholesale power or the PJM
electric power pool real-time locational marginal pricing rate.  All
electricity used by the customer's qualified facilities, with the exception of
the facility or property on which the solar electric power generation system is
installed, shall be billed at the full retail rate pursuant to the electric
public utility tariff applicable to the customer class of the customer using
the electricity.  A customer may contract with a third party to operate a solar
electric power generation system, for the purpose of net metering aggregation. 
Any contractual relationship entered into for operation of a solar electric
power generation system related to net metering aggregation shall include
contractual protections that provide for adequate performance and provision for
construction and operation for the term of the contract, including any
appropriate bonding or escrow requirements.  Any incremental cost to an
electric public utility for net metering aggregation shall be fully and timely
recovered in a manner to be determined by the board.  The board shall adopt net
metering aggregation standards within 270 days after the effective date of
P.L.2012, c.24. </p>

Legislative findings and declarations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature finds and
declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    There is a great need
for consumer protection and advocacy on behalf of the indigent, the elderly,
children, and other persons unable to protect themselves as individuals or a
class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Consolidating the
diffuse functions of ombudspersons, Rate Counsel, and other functions within a
single Department of the Public Advocate will produce cost savings and more
effective protection of the public interest and empower the Public Advocate to
coordinate an efficient and timely process for evaluation and resolution of
problems and disputes that affect consumers and other interested parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The abolition of the
Public Advocate by P.L.2010, c.34 and the transfer of some of its functions to
various departments has resulted in diffuse, ineffective representation of the
rights of those unable to effectively advocate for themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    It is essential that the
State of New Jersey marshal existing resources scattered throughout State
government and create economies of scale that will aid in the effective
delivery of public services and the appropriate allocation of public resources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.    The Legislature must
protect the public and restore confidence in government through effective
advocacy, provided by the Department of the Public Advocate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Litigation is a costly
and oftentimes ineffective means of resolving disputes, and State government
must provide leadership and foster an environment for alternative dispute
resolution.  The public will benefit greatly from a Public Advocate devoted to
a cost-effective means to avoid expensive litigation and an amicable way to
resolve disputes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Children have special
advocacy needs that require familiarity and expertise regarding the issues that
affect them and the Office of the Child Advocate allocated within the
Department of the Public Advocate can effectively fulfill those needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The elderly represent an
ever-increasing portion of the population that requires special attention, and
a Division of Elder Advocacy can effectively meet those needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     There must be a
transfer of funding to fund the operations of the Department of the Public
