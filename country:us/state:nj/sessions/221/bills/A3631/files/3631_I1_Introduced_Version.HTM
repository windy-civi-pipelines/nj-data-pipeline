STATEMENT This bill would provide that any person with a physical, intellectual, or developmental disability who is between 18 and 21 years of age or older is eligible to receive direct support professional services from the Department of Human Services.  A direct support professional provides direct, non-medical supportive assistance, on a daily basis, to a person who has a physical, intellectual, or developmental disability, with the aim of helping the person to:  become better integrated into the community or the least restrictive environment; more effectively understand, communicate, and advocate for, the persons individual needs and desires; identify and participate in positive employment, job coaching, and training opportunities; make informed choices, and better understand the options and possible consequences of choices relating to physical health, safety, and emotional well-being; address challenging behaviors through a person-centered approach; successfully engage in the basic activities of daily living; identify and participate in activities that promote a healthy lifestyle; and otherwise lead a self-directed and autonomous life. Currently, individuals are not eligible for benefits from the Department of Human Services, including services from direct support professionals, until they reach the age of 21.  Before the age of 21, it is assumed that individuals will receive necessary services at school, through the Department of Education.  This bill would ensure that individuals who graduate high school earlier than age 21 are eligible for direct support professional services. The bill would require the Commissioner of Human Services, in consultation with the Commissioner of Children and Families and the Assistant Commissioner of the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Human Services, to adopt rules and regulations to implement the bills provisions.
