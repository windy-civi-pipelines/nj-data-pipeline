(2)   Monies deposited in the fund shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in public depositories, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.236 (C.17:9-41), and may be invested or reinvested in such securities as are approved by the State Treasurer.  Interest or other income earned on monies deposited in the fund shall be credited to the fund for use as set forth in subsection b. of this section for other monies in the fund. b.    Monies in the "Nourishing Young Minds Initiative Fund" shall be used by the Department of Agriculture to provide support and funding to child food and nutrition programs in the State, which may include: (1)   funding outreach and programmatic support by the Department of Agriculture, Department of Education, or community-based organizations; (2)   providing small grants to fund one-time startup or expansion costs of breakfast after the bell programs; [and] (3)   providing small grants to fund one-time startup or expansion costs of summer nutrition programs; and (4)   providing reimbursement grants under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), to fund one-time startup costs incurred by eligible applicant preschools in association with the initiation thereby of federally reimbursable preschool snack programs. c.     Funding made available under paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection b. of this section shall be prioritized for award to districts or schools [with] having the highest number of students who are federally eligible [students] for subsidized school meals and the lowest rates of student participation in the [school breakfast program] States subsidized school meals programs. d.    The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of Education, may adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations necessary for the implementation of this [act] section. e.     To the extent deemed by the secretary to be necessary to continue the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the secretary shall include, in each annual budget request submitted thereby in each fiscal year following the expenditure of funds initially appropriated for the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, pursuant to section 10 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), a formal request seeking a supplemental legislative appropriation of $100,000 or such other sum, not exceeding $1.21 multiplied by the total number of preschoolers enrolled at all remaining eligible preschools in the State, which sum is deemed by the secretary to be sufficient to support the continued issuance of reimbursement grant awards to such remaining eligible preschools, upon application therefor.  Any moneys appropriated pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the Nourishing Young Minds Initiative Fund and shall be dedicated for use in issuing reimbursement grant awards under, and for the purposes of, the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf:  P.L.2017, c.132, s.1) 8.    Section 1 of P.L.2019, c.307 (C.18A:33-27.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  Each school food authority that provides a food service, either to students enrolled in a participating school district or nonpublic school or to preschoolers enrolled in a participating preschool in the State, shall, in the two languages [that are] most commonly spoken in the homes of students in each participating school or of preschoolers in each participating preschool served by the school food authority: (1)   develop and implement an educational campaign to inform the parents and guardians of [such] students or preschoolers, who are enrolled at the schools or preschools where the school food authority provides a food service, about the various school meals programs that are available [for students] in New Jersey, and about the availability of subsidized school meals, under such programs, for eligible students [who are categorically eligible or income-eligible therefor] and eligible preschoolers; and (2)   develop promotional materials for the State's school meals programs, and provide copies of the promotional materials to each school and preschool that is served by the school food authority in the State, for distribution, by school or preschool staff, to the parents and guardians of students enrolled [at the school] therein. The school food authority shall utilize existing resources, which have been made available by the United States Department of Agriculture and the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, in developing promotional materials for the purposes of this paragraph.  The promotional materials shall include, but need not be limited to, pamphlets, presentation materials, webinars, and sample letters that schools and preschools may send to parents and guardians. b.    The educational campaign and promotional materials developed under subsection a. of this section shall: (1)   satisfy the standards, and comply with the guidelines, established by the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of Education, pursuant to subsection c. of this section; (2)   highlight and promote the nature, purposes, value, and importance of the National School Lunch Program, the federal School Breakfast Program, the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the federal Summer Food Service Program[,] and other similar summer meals programs, as well as the [States] State-level breakfast after the bell programs[,] and emergency meals distribution programs established and operated pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2014, c.66 (C.18A:33-11.1) or section 2 of P.L.2018, c.25 (C.18A:33-11.3)[, the State's emergency meals distribution programs, established pursuant to] and section 1 of P.L.2020, c.6 (C.18A:33-27.2), and any new school meals programs that are implemented in the State after the effective date of P.L.2022, c.103; (3)   emphasize the importance of providing a nutritious meal to all children for their general health and success in school and preschool; (4)   emphasize and promote the ability of eligible students and eligible preschoolers to obtain subsidized [meals] school lunches, subsidized school breakfasts, and subsidized preschool snacks, as appropriate, under the State's school meals programs, and inform parents and guardians about the various ways in which a student or preschooler may be determined to be categorically eligible or income-eligible therefor[, and identify the federal and State-level criteria that must be satisfied in order for a student to obtain subsidized school meals, under these programs, on the basis of annual household income]; (5)   highlight and describe the application and determination processes that are used, by preschools, schools, and school districts, to certify categorically eligible and income-eligible students and preschoolers, as the case may be, for subsidized school meals; (6)   highlight and describe the rights that are applicable to students and preschoolers, and their families, in association with [a student's] such students or preschoolers receipt of subsidized or unsubsidized school meals in the State; and (7)   inform parents and guardians about the nature and extent of any proposed or implemented expansion of the States existing school meals programs [in the State], including, but not limited to, the nature and extent of any proposed or implemented expansion of the categories of students or preschoolers who are eligible for subsidized school meals under such programs. c.     (1) Within 60 days after the effective date of P.L.2022, c.103, the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of Education, shall adopt standards and guidelines to ensure the uniformity and accuracy of school meals-related information being presented by school food authorities as part of the educational campaigns conducted, and in the promotional materials distributed, pursuant to this section. (2)   Within 60 days of the effective date of P.L.2022, c.103, and on a periodic basis thereafter, as necessary, the Department of Education shall provide, to each school food authority that offers a food service to students at a participating school or to preschoolers at a participating preschool in the State, information concerning the two languages that are most commonly spoken in the homes of students or preschoolers enrolled at each such participating school or preschool served thereby.  The Department of Education shall periodically, and at least every five years, verify the two languages that are most commonly spoken in the homes of students and preschoolers in each such participating school and preschool, for the purposes of this subsection. d.    As used in this section: "School food authority" shall mean the school, preschool, school district, or third-party food service vendor, as applicable, which is responsible for providing a food service to students enrolled at a participating school or to preschoolers enrolled at a participating preschool. (cf:  P.L.2023, c.336, s.12) 9.    (New section)  a.  Not more than 90 days after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the department shall establish and shall commence operating a Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, the purpose of which shall be to annually provide reimbursement grant funding to support the initiation of federally reimbursable preschool snack programs by eligible applicant preschools in the State. b.    Individual grants issued, by the department, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program shall be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to each eligible applicant preschool, within the limits of moneys appropriated or otherwise made available to the department for the programs purposes. c.     (1) Reimbursement grant funding awarded to an eligible applicant preschool, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, shall be used solely to reimburse the costs that are expended by the preschool, or by another school food authority, in association with the provision thereby of free snacks, to preschoolers enrolled at the preschool, during a term-limited grant reimbursement period that shall be deemed to commence on the same date on which the preschool submits its initial federal application, to the United States Department of Agriculture, seeking approval to participate in and to offer federally reimbursable preschool snacks under the CACFP, and shall be deemed to expire on the same date on which the preschool receives formal written notice, from the United States Department of Agriculture, approving or disapproving the preschools completed CACFP application. (2)   Individual grant awards issued to eligible applicant preschools, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, shall not be used to reimburse:  (a) any costs, other than those eligible costs which are described in paragraph (1) of this subsection; or (b) any eligible costs, as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, which are reimbursable or have already been paid for with other State or federal funds. (3)   The dollar amount of each individual grant award issued, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, shall be sufficient to retroactively reimburse the eligible costs, as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, which are expended by the preschool, or by a school food authority that is lawfully contracted to provide snack services at the preschool, in providing free snacks to preschoolers enrolled at the preschool during the term-limited grant reimbursement period established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection; however, in no case shall the total dollar amount awarded, pursuant to an individual program grant, exceed an amount that is equal to $1.21 multiplied by the total number of preschoolers who are enrolled at the eligible applicant preschool at the commencement of the term-limited grant reimbursement period established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.  In addition, in any case where another State or federal agency or program provides funding to offset the same eligible costs for which program grant funding may be awarded and used, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the total such eligible costs which are deemed to be eligible for funding, and the total dollar amount of the individual grant award issued to the eligible applicant preschool, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, shall each be reduced by the total dollar amount of all such other State or federal contributions. d.    A preschool that wishes to obtain a grant under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program shall submit an application therefor, in a form and manner, and by an annual deadline, prescribed by the secretary.  Each grant application shall, at a minimum: (1)   include a statement certifying the date on which the preschool submitted its initial application, to the United States Department of Agriculture, seeking approval to participate in, and to provide federally reimbursable preschool snacks to enrolled preschoolers under, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and further certifying the current status of such federal application, including whether such application is still pending completion, and whether the application, if completed, is still pending federal approval or disapproval; (2)   identify the total number of preschoolers that were enrolled in the applicant preschool on the date, identified pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, on which the preschool submitted its initial application under the Child and Adult Care Food Program; (3)   identify the types of snacks served to preschoolers enrolled at the preschool, as well as the nutritional value thereof; (4)   describe the methods used, by the preschool, to provide snacks to enrolled preschoolers, including, but not limited to, whether, and the extent to which, preschool snacks are provided to enrolled preschoolers through snack services rendered by a lawfully contracted school food authority; (5)   identify the number and percentage of preschoolers enrolled at the school who are known to be categorically eligible or income-eligible for free or reduced price preschool snacks offered under the Child and Adult Care Food Program; (6)   identify all other State or federal grant awards and financing options that are available to finance the preschools eligible costs, as defined in paragraph (1) of subsection c. of this section; and (7)   provide any other information required by the secretary. e.     A preschool that is approved for reimbursement grant funding, pursuant to this section, shall not be entitled to receive a lump-sum disbursement of awarded program grant funds, but shall, instead, be required to prepare and submit a monthly invoice and accounting statement, to the secretary, in each month of the term-limited grant reimbursement period established pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection c. of this section, in order to receive a disbursement of grant funds awarded pursuant to this section.  Each monthly invoice and accounting statement shall include: (1)   appropriate receipts, photos, or other documentation verifying the expenditures being accounted for in the monthly invoice and accounting statement; (2)   a brief explanation documenting why such expenditures should be deemed to constitute eligible costs for the purposes of program reimbursement; and (3)   a statement certifying that the recipient of the grant award has not yet received written notice, from the United States Department of Agriculture, disapproving and denying the recipients application to participate in, and to provide federally reimbursable preschool snacks under, the Child and Adult Care Food Program. f.     (1) Grant funds awarded under the program shall be disbursed to the recipient school district on a rolling, term-limited, monthly installment basis, over the course of a single year and using a draw-down process that provides for reimbursement checks to be issued to the recipient preschool within 60 days after the department receives each monthly invoice and accounting statement submitted thereby pursuant to subsection e. of this section.  The amount of each such installment payment shall be sufficient, within the limits of the preschools program grant award, to reimburse the eligible costs documented in the preschools most recent monthly invoice and accounting statement. (2)   Grant funds disbursed to an eligible applicant preschool, pursuant to this subsection, may be further allocated, by the recipient preschool, to school food authorities that are contractually obligated to provide snack services at the preschool, in order to reimburse the eligible costs that were expended thereby, during the term-limited grant reimbursement period established pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, as documented in the preschools most recent invoice and accounting statement. g.    (1)  Any program grant funds that are awarded to an eligible applicant preschool and which remain unclaimed and unexpended thereby at the conclusion of the term-limited grant reimbursement period established pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, shall, at that time, be reclaimed by the secretary and used to finance future grant awards under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program. (2)   In any case where awarded program grant moneys are disbursed to a federally unapproved participant preschool, pursuant to this section, and the preschool thereafter receives written notice, from the United States Department of Agriculture, disapproving and formally denying the preschools completed CACFP application, the preschool shall be required to immediately repay, and the secretary shall be required to recoup, any sums previously awarded and disbursed thereto, pursuant to this section, and any previously recouped sums shall be used to finance future grant awards under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program. 10.  (New section) There is appropriated, from the General Fund to the Department of Agriculture, the sum of $100,000, which shall be deposited in the Nourishing Young Minds Initiative Fund, established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2017, c.132 (C.18A:33-22) and dedicated for use in issuing initial reimbursement grants under, and in otherwise administering, the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program during the first year of program operations.  The secretary shall endeavor to minimize new administrative costs associated with the departments implementation of the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, to the maximum extent practicable, by treating the reimbursement grant program as an integral component, and by administering the grant program within the broader context, of the States existing statutory and administrative rubric governing the operation of, and the issuance of State-level reimbursement payments under, the States other school meals programs. 11.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend and supplement the existing statutory rubric that governs the operation of school meals programs in New Jersey and the State-level reimbursement of certain federally unreimbursed costs incurred by participating schools and school districts in association therewith, in order to include new provisions specifically governing the operation of preschool snack programs in New Jersey and further providing for the State-level reimbursement of certain federally unreimbursed costs incurred by participating preschools in providing requisite snacks to preschoolers.  Although federal reimbursement is currently available for preschools that provide free or reduced price snacks to enrolled preschoolers under the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which is operated pursuant to the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, 42 U.S.C. s.1751 et seq., preschools are, generally, not eligible to receive federal reimbursement for any snacks that are served thereby in accordance with CACFP requirements, until such time as the preschools federal application, seeking initial authorization to participate as a CACFP snack provider, is formally approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  Moreover, because federal law generally prohibits the retroactive issuance of snack program reimbursement payments, on a back-pay basis, any preschools that are federally approved to participate as a CACFP snack provider will still be ineligible, under existing law, to receive federal reimbursement for otherwise federally reimbursable snacks that were served thereby to preschoolers during the period of time when the preschools federal CACFP application was pending completion or final determination by the USDA. This bill would endeavor to establish greater consistency in this area by folding relevant school snack program requirements into the States existing school meals program law, and by providing for the State to reimburse certain federally unreimbursed costs incurred by preschools, in association with their provision of snacks to preschoolers, in a manner that is consistent with the existing State reimbursement requirements applicable to authorized school lunch and breakfast providers. Specifically, the bill would amend and supplement the States existing school meals program laws, in order to incorporate the following snack program-related provisions: (1)   provisions requiring all federally eligible preschools in the State to maximize their receipt of federal resources available for preschool snacks, both by applying for and obtaining federal approval to participate as CACFP snack providers (or explaining the reasons why a CACFP application has not been submitted or has been federally disapproved and denied), and, as appropriate, by applying for and obtaining federal approval to additionally provide federally reimbursable free afterschool snacks to at-risk youth under, and for the purposes of, the CACFPs Special Program for At-Risk School Children, established pursuant to subsection r. of 42 U.S.C. s.1766 and 7 C.F.R. Part 226; (2)   provisions that would require the State Department of Agriculture to establish and operate a new Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, the purpose of which would be to annually provide State-level reimbursement grant funding sufficient to offset the initial, federally unreimbursed costs being incurred by preschools that engage in the provision of snacks to preschoolers during the term-limited period when the preschools federal CACFP application is pending completion and formal federal approval or disapproval; (3)   provisions requiring all federally approved CACFP preschool snack providers to provide snacks to all enrolled preschoolers, free-of-charge; and (4)   provisions requiring the State to reimburse the federally unreimbursed costs of all free and reduced price snacks served by federally approved CACFP preschool snack providers. The bill would appropriate, to the Department of Agriculture, for deposit into the existing Nourishing Young Minds Initiative Fund, an initial sum of $100,000 to be dedicated and used for the purposes of financing reimbursement grants issued, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, in the first year of program operations. The bill would further require the State Secretary of Agriculture, following the expenditure of such initially appropriated sums, to make annually recurring budget requests for supplemental appropriations, in an amount of $100,000 per year, or another amount, not exceeding $1.21 multiplied by the total number of preschoolers enrolled at all remaining eligible preschools in the State, as may be deemed thereby to be necessary to continue the grant program and facilitate the ongoing issuance of grant awards to eligible preschool applicants thereunder.

(cf:  P.L.2023, c.336, s.10) 6.    Section 1 of P L.2019, c.445 (C.18A:33-21.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  Notwithstanding any other law, or rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, to the contrary[,]: (1)   a student who is enrolled in a participating school district or nonpublic school and is eligible for a reduced price breakfast under the federal School Breakfast Program or a reduced price lunch under the National School Lunch Program, shall not be required to pay for any such reduced price breakfast or reduced price lunch; and (2)   a preschooler who is enrolled in a participating preschool and is eligible for a reduced price preschool snack under the Child and Adult Care Food Program, shall not be required to pay for any such reduced price snack. b.    The State shall pay the difference between: (1)   the federal allocation for reduced price breakfasts and reduced price lunches and the total cost of the reduced price breakfasts and reduced price lunches that are served, by participating school districts and nonpublic schools, to enrolled students who are federally eligible for reduced price meals; and (2)   the federal allocation for reduced price snacks and the total cost of reduced price snacks that are served, by participating preschools, to enrolled preschoolers who are federally eligible for reduced price snacks. c.     The Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of Education, shall adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to implement the provisions of this section, including, but not limited to, rules and regulations establishing the schedule for, and identifying the manner in which, State-level reimbursements are to be made pursuant to subsection b. of this section. (cf:  P.L.2023, c.336, s.11) 7.    Section 1 of P.L.2017, c.132 (C.18A:33-22) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  (1) There is hereby created in the Department of Agriculture a non-lapsing revolving fund to be known as the "Nourishing Young Minds Initiative Fund," which shall be held separate and apart from all other funds of the State.  All monies appropriated annually by the Legislature, all federal and other [grants] grant monies received by the State, and any other monies made available for the funds purposes [of the fund] shall be deposited in the fund. (2)   Monies deposited in the fund shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in public depositories, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.236 (C.17:9-41), and may be invested or reinvested in such securities as are approved by the State Treasurer.  Interest or other income earned on monies deposited in the fund shall be credited to the fund for use as set forth in subsection b. of this section for other monies in the fund. b.    Monies in the "Nourishing Young Minds Initiative Fund" shall be used by the Department of Agriculture to provide support and funding to child food and nutrition programs in the State, which may include: (1)   funding outreach and programmatic support by the Department of Agriculture, Department of Education, or community-based organizations; (2)   providing small grants to fund one-time startup or expansion costs of breakfast after the bell programs; [and] (3)   providing small grants to fund one-time startup or expansion costs of summer nutrition programs; and (4)   providing reimbursement grants under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), to fund one-time startup costs incurred by eligible applicant preschools in association with the initiation thereby of federally reimbursable preschool snack programs. c.     Funding made available under paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection b. of this section shall be prioritized for award to districts or schools [with] having the highest number of students who are federally eligible [students] for subsidized school meals and the lowest rates of student participation in the [school breakfast program] States subsidized school meals programs. d.    The Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of Education, may adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations necessary for the implementation of this [act] section. e.     To the extent deemed by the secretary to be necessary to continue the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the secretary shall include, in each annual budget request submitted thereby in each fiscal year following the expenditure of funds initially appropriated for the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, pursuant to section 10 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), a formal request seeking a supplemental legislative appropriation of $100,000 or such other sum, not exceeding $1.21 multiplied by the total number of preschoolers enrolled at all remaining eligible preschools in the State, which sum is deemed by the secretary to be sufficient to support the continued issuance of reimbursement grant awards to such remaining eligible preschools, upon application therefor.  Any moneys appropriated pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the Nourishing Young Minds Initiative Fund and shall be dedicated for use in issuing reimbursement grant awards under, and for the purposes of, the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf:  P.L.2017, c.132, s.1) 8.    Section 1 of P.L.2019, c.307 (C.18A:33-27.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  Each school food authority that provides a food service, either to students enrolled in a participating school district or nonpublic school or to preschoolers enrolled in a participating preschool in the State, shall, in the two languages [that are] most commonly spoken in the homes of students in each participating school or of preschoolers in each participating preschool served by the school food authority: (1)   develop and implement an educational campaign to inform the parents and guardians of [such] students or preschoolers, who are enrolled at the schools or preschools where the school food authority provides a food service, about the various school meals programs that are available [for students] in New Jersey, and about the availability of subsidized school meals, under such programs, for eligible students [who are categorically eligible or income-eligible therefor] and eligible preschoolers; and (2)   develop promotional materials for the State's school meals programs, and provide copies of the promotional materials to each school and preschool that is served by the school food authority in the State, for distribution, by school or preschool staff, to the parents and guardians of students enrolled [at the school] therein. The school food authority shall utilize existing resources, which have been made available by the United States Department of Agriculture and the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, in developing promotional materials for the purposes of this paragraph.  The promotional materials shall include, but need not be limited to, pamphlets, presentation materials, webinars, and sample letters that schools and preschools may send to parents and guardians. b.    The educational campaign and promotional materials developed under subsection a. of this section shall: (1)   satisfy the standards, and comply with the guidelines, established by the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of Education, pursuant to subsection c. of this section; (2)   highlight and promote the nature, purposes, value, and importance of the National School Lunch Program, the federal School Breakfast Program, the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the federal Summer Food Service Program[,] and other similar summer meals programs, as well as the [States] State-level breakfast after the bell programs[,] and emergency meals distribution programs established and operated pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2014, c.66 (C.18A:33-11.1) or section 2 of P.L.2018, c.25 (C.18A:33-11.3)[, the State's emergency meals distribution programs, established pursuant to] and section 1 of P.L.2020, c.6 (C.18A:33-27.2), and any new school meals programs that are implemented in the State after the effective date of P.L.2022, c.103; (3)   emphasize the importance of providing a nutritious meal to all children for their general health and success in school and preschool; (4)   emphasize and promote the ability of eligible students and eligible preschoolers to obtain subsidized [meals] school lunches, subsidized school breakfasts, and subsidized preschool snacks, as appropriate, under the State's school meals programs, and inform parents and guardians about the various ways in which a student or preschooler may be determined to be categorically eligible or income-eligible therefor[, and identify the federal and State-level criteria that must be satisfied in order for a student to obtain subsidized school meals, under these programs, on the basis of annual household income]; (5)   highlight and describe the application and determination processes that are used, by preschools, schools, and school districts, to certify categorically eligible and income-eligible students and preschoolers, as the case may be, for subsidized school meals; (6)   highlight and describe the rights that are applicable to students and preschoolers, and their families, in association with [a student's] such students or preschoolers receipt of subsidized or unsubsidized school meals in the State; and (7)   inform parents and guardians about the nature and extent of any proposed or implemented expansion of the States existing school meals programs [in the State], including, but not limited to, the nature and extent of any proposed or implemented expansion of the categories of students or preschoolers who are eligible for subsidized school meals under such programs. c.     (1) Within 60 days after the effective date of P.L.2022, c.103, the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of Education, shall adopt standards and guidelines to ensure the uniformity and accuracy of school meals-related information being presented by school food authorities as part of the educational campaigns conducted, and in the promotional materials distributed, pursuant to this section. (2)   Within 60 days of the effective date of P.L.2022, c.103, and on a periodic basis thereafter, as necessary, the Department of Education shall provide, to each school food authority that offers a food service to students at a participating school or to preschoolers at a participating preschool in the State, information concerning the two languages that are most commonly spoken in the homes of students or preschoolers enrolled at each such participating school or preschool served thereby.  The Department of Education shall periodically, and at least every five years, verify the two languages that are most commonly spoken in the homes of students and preschoolers in each such participating school and preschool, for the purposes of this subsection. d.    As used in this section: "School food authority" shall mean the school, preschool, school district, or third-party food service vendor, as applicable, which is responsible for providing a food service to students enrolled at a participating school or to preschoolers enrolled at a participating preschool. (cf:  P.L.2023, c.336, s.12) 9.    (New section)  a.  Not more than 90 days after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the department shall establish and shall commence operating a Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, the purpose of which shall be to annually provide reimbursement grant funding to support the initiation of federally reimbursable preschool snack programs by eligible applicant preschools in the State. b.    Individual grants issued, by the department, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program shall be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to each eligible applicant preschool, within the limits of moneys appropriated or otherwise made available to the department for the programs purposes. c.     (1) Reimbursement grant funding awarded to an eligible applicant preschool, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, shall be used solely to reimburse the costs that are expended by the preschool, or by another school food authority, in association with the provision thereby of free snacks, to preschoolers enrolled at the preschool, during a term-limited grant reimbursement period that shall be deemed to commence on the same date on which the preschool submits its initial federal application, to the United States Department of Agriculture, seeking approval to participate in and to offer federally reimbursable preschool snacks under the CACFP, and shall be deemed to expire on the same date on which the preschool receives formal written notice, from the United States Department of Agriculture, approving or disapproving the preschools completed CACFP application. (2)   Individual grant awards issued to eligible applicant preschools, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, shall not be used to reimburse:  (a) any costs, other than those eligible costs which are described in paragraph (1) of this subsection; or (b) any eligible costs, as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, which are reimbursable or have already been paid for with other State or federal funds. (3)   The dollar amount of each individual grant award issued, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, shall be sufficient to retroactively reimburse the eligible costs, as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, which are expended by the preschool, or by a school food authority that is lawfully contracted to provide snack services at the preschool, in providing free snacks to preschoolers enrolled at the preschool during the term-limited grant reimbursement period established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection; however, in no case shall the total dollar amount awarded, pursuant to an individual program grant, exceed an amount that is equal to $1.21 multiplied by the total number of preschoolers who are enrolled at the eligible applicant preschool at the commencement of the term-limited grant reimbursement period established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.  In addition, in any case where another State or federal agency or program provides funding to offset the same eligible costs for which program grant funding may be awarded and used, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the total such eligible costs which are deemed to be eligible for funding, and the total dollar amount of the individual grant award issued to the eligible applicant preschool, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, shall each be reduced by the total dollar amount of all such other State or federal contributions. d.    A preschool that wishes to obtain a grant under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program shall submit an application therefor, in a form and manner, and by an annual deadline, prescribed by the secretary.  Each grant application shall, at a minimum: (1)   include a statement certifying the date on which the preschool submitted its initial application, to the United States Department of Agriculture, seeking approval to participate in, and to provide federally reimbursable preschool snacks to enrolled preschoolers under, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and further certifying the current status of such federal application, including whether such application is still pending completion, and whether the application, if completed, is still pending federal approval or disapproval; (2)   identify the total number of preschoolers that were enrolled in the applicant preschool on the date, identified pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, on which the preschool submitted its initial application under the Child and Adult Care Food Program; (3)   identify the types of snacks served to preschoolers enrolled at the preschool, as well as the nutritional value thereof; (4)   describe the methods used, by the preschool, to provide snacks to enrolled preschoolers, including, but not limited to, whether, and the extent to which, preschool snacks are provided to enrolled preschoolers through snack services rendered by a lawfully contracted school food authority; (5)   identify the number and percentage of preschoolers enrolled at the school who are known to be categorically eligible or income-eligible for free or reduced price preschool snacks offered under the Child and Adult Care Food Program; (6)   identify all other State or federal grant awards and financing options that are available to finance the preschools eligible costs, as defined in paragraph (1) of subsection c. of this section; and (7)   provide any other information required by the secretary. e.     A preschool that is approved for reimbursement grant funding, pursuant to this section, shall not be entitled to receive a lump-sum disbursement of awarded program grant funds, but shall, instead, be required to prepare and submit a monthly invoice and accounting statement, to the secretary, in each month of the term-limited grant reimbursement period established pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection c. of this section, in order to receive a disbursement of grant funds awarded pursuant to this section.  Each monthly invoice and accounting statement shall include: (1)   appropriate receipts, photos, or other documentation verifying the expenditures being accounted for in the monthly invoice and accounting statement; (2)   a brief explanation documenting why such expenditures should be deemed to constitute eligible costs for the purposes of program reimbursement; and (3)   a statement certifying that the recipient of the grant award has not yet received written notice, from the United States Department of Agriculture, disapproving and denying the recipients application to participate in, and to provide federally reimbursable preschool snacks under, the Child and Adult Care Food Program. f.     (1) Grant funds awarded under the program shall be disbursed to the recipient school district on a rolling, term-limited, monthly installment basis, over the course of a single year and using a draw-down process that provides for reimbursement checks to be issued to the recipient preschool within 60 days after the department receives each monthly invoice and accounting statement submitted thereby pursuant to subsection e. of this section.  The amount of each such installment payment shall be sufficient, within the limits of the preschools program grant award, to reimburse the eligible costs documented in the preschools most recent monthly invoice and accounting statement. (2)   Grant funds disbursed to an eligible applicant preschool, pursuant to this subsection, may be further allocated, by the recipient preschool, to school food authorities that are contractually obligated to provide snack services at the preschool, in order to reimburse the eligible costs that were expended thereby, during the term-limited grant reimbursement period established pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, as documented in the preschools most recent invoice and accounting statement. g.    (1)  Any program grant funds that are awarded to an eligible applicant preschool and which remain unclaimed and unexpended thereby at the conclusion of the term-limited grant reimbursement period established pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, shall, at that time, be reclaimed by the secretary and used to finance future grant awards under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program. (2)   In any case where awarded program grant moneys are disbursed to a federally unapproved participant preschool, pursuant to this section, and the preschool thereafter receives written notice, from the United States Department of Agriculture, disapproving and formally denying the preschools completed CACFP application, the preschool shall be required to immediately repay, and the secretary shall be required to recoup, any sums previously awarded and disbursed thereto, pursuant to this section, and any previously recouped sums shall be used to finance future grant awards under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program. 10.  (New section) There is appropriated, from the General Fund to the Department of Agriculture, the sum of $100,000, which shall be deposited in the Nourishing Young Minds Initiative Fund, established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2017, c.132 (C.18A:33-22) and dedicated for use in issuing initial reimbursement grants under, and in otherwise administering, the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program during the first year of program operations.  The secretary shall endeavor to minimize new administrative costs associated with the departments implementation of the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, to the maximum extent practicable, by treating the reimbursement grant program as an integral component, and by administering the grant program within the broader context, of the States existing statutory and administrative rubric governing the operation of, and the issuance of State-level reimbursement payments under, the States other school meals programs. 11.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend and supplement the existing statutory rubric that governs the operation of school meals programs in New Jersey and the State-level reimbursement of certain federally unreimbursed costs incurred by participating schools and school districts in association therewith, in order to include new provisions specifically governing the operation of preschool snack programs in New Jersey and further providing for the State-level reimbursement of certain federally unreimbursed costs incurred by participating preschools in providing requisite snacks to preschoolers.  Although federal reimbursement is currently available for preschools that provide free or reduced price snacks to enrolled preschoolers under the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which is operated pursuant to the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, 42 U.S.C. s.1751 et seq., preschools are, generally, not eligible to receive federal reimbursement for any snacks that are served thereby in accordance with CACFP requirements, until such time as the preschools federal application, seeking initial authorization to participate as a CACFP snack provider, is formally approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  Moreover, because federal law generally prohibits the retroactive issuance of snack program reimbursement payments, on a back-pay basis, any preschools that are federally approved to participate as a CACFP snack provider will still be ineligible, under existing law, to receive federal reimbursement for otherwise federally reimbursable snacks that were served thereby to preschoolers during the period of time when the preschools federal CACFP application was pending completion or final determination by the USDA. This bill would endeavor to establish greater consistency in this area by folding relevant school snack program requirements into the States existing school meals program law, and by providing for the State to reimburse certain federally unreimbursed costs incurred by preschools, in association with their provision of snacks to preschoolers, in a manner that is consistent with the existing State reimbursement requirements applicable to authorized school lunch and breakfast providers. Specifically, the bill would amend and supplement the States existing school meals program laws, in order to incorporate the following snack program-related provisions: (1)   provisions requiring all federally eligible preschools in the State to maximize their receipt of federal resources available for preschool snacks, both by applying for and obtaining federal approval to participate as CACFP snack providers (or explaining the reasons why a CACFP application has not been submitted or has been federally disapproved and denied), and, as appropriate, by applying for and obtaining federal approval to additionally provide federally reimbursable free afterschool snacks to at-risk youth under, and for the purposes of, the CACFPs Special Program for At-Risk School Children, established pursuant to subsection r. of 42 U.S.C. s.1766 and 7 C.F.R. Part 226; (2)   provisions that would require the State Department of Agriculture to establish and operate a new Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, the purpose of which would be to annually provide State-level reimbursement grant funding sufficient to offset the initial, federally unreimbursed costs being incurred by preschools that engage in the provision of snacks to preschoolers during the term-limited period when the preschools federal CACFP application is pending completion and formal federal approval or disapproval; (3)   provisions requiring all federally approved CACFP preschool snack providers to provide snacks to all enrolled preschoolers, free-of-charge; and (4)   provisions requiring the State to reimburse the federally unreimbursed costs of all free and reduced price snacks served by federally approved CACFP preschool snack providers. The bill would appropriate, to the Department of Agriculture, for deposit into the existing Nourishing Young Minds Initiative Fund, an initial sum of $100,000 to be dedicated and used for the purposes of financing reimbursement grants issued, under the Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, in the first year of program operations. The bill would further require the State Secretary of Agriculture, following the expenditure of such initially appropriated sums, to make annually recurring budget requests for supplemental appropriations, in an amount of $100,000 per year, or another amount, not exceeding $1.21 multiplied by the total number of preschoolers enrolled at all remaining eligible preschools in the State, as may be deemed thereby to be necessary to continue the grant program and facilitate the ongoing issuance of grant awards to eligible preschool applicants thereunder.
