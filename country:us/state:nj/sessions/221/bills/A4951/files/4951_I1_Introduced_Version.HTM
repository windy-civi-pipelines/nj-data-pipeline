<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend and
supplement the existing statutory rubric that governs the operation of school
meals programs in New Jersey and the State-level reimbursement of certain federally
unreimbursed costs incurred by participating schools and school districts in
association therewith, in order to include new provisions specifically governing
the operation of preschool snack programs in New Jersey and further providing for
the State-level reimbursement of certain federally unreimbursed costs incurred
by participating preschools in providing requisite snacks to preschoolers.  Although
federal reimbursement is currently available for preschools that provide free
or reduced price snacks to enrolled preschoolers under the federal Child and
Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), which is operated pursuant to the Richard B.
Russell National School Lunch Act, 42 U.S.C. s.1751 et seq., preschools are,
generally, not eligible to receive federal reimbursement for any snacks that
are served thereby in accordance with CACFP requirements, until such time as
the preschools federal application, seeking initial authorization to
participate as a CACFP snack provider, is formally approved by the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  Moreover, because federal law
generally prohibits the retroactive issuance of snack program reimbursement
payments, on a back-pay basis, any preschools that are federally approved to
participate as a CACFP snack provider will still be ineligible, under existing
law, to receive federal reimbursement for otherwise federally reimbursable snacks
that were served thereby to preschoolers during the period of time when the
preschools federal CACFP application was pending completion or final
determination by the USDA.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would endeavor to
establish greater consistency in this area by folding relevant school snack
program requirements into the States existing school meals program law, and by
providing for the State to reimburse certain federally unreimbursed costs
incurred by preschools, in association with their provision of snacks to
preschoolers, in a manner that is consistent with the existing State
reimbursement requirements applicable to authorized school lunch and breakfast providers. 
Specifically, the bill would amend and supplement the States existing school
meals program laws, in order to incorporate the following snack program-related
provisions:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   provisions requiring all
federally eligible preschools in the State to maximize their receipt of federal
resources available for preschool snacks, both by applying for and obtaining
federal approval to participate as CACFP snack providers (or explaining the
reasons why a CACFP application has not been submitted or has been federally
disapproved and denied), and, as appropriate, by applying for and obtaining
federal approval to additionally provide federally reimbursable free
afterschool snacks to at-risk youth under, and for the purposes of, the CACFPs
Special Program for At-Risk School Children, established pursuant to subsection
r. of 42 U.S.C. s.1766 and 7 C.F.R. Part 226;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   provisions that would
require the State Department of Agriculture to establish and operate a new
Preschool Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, the purpose of which would be to
annually provide State-level reimbursement grant funding sufficient to offset
the initial, federally unreimbursed costs being incurred by preschools that
engage in the provision of snacks to preschoolers during the term-limited
period when the preschools federal CACFP application is pending completion and
formal federal approval or disapproval; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   provisions requiring all
federally approved CACFP preschool snack providers to provide snacks to all
enrolled preschoolers, free-of-charge; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   provisions requiring the
State to reimburse the federally unreimbursed costs of all free and reduced
price snacks served by federally approved CACFP preschool snack providers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would appropriate, to
the Department of Agriculture, for deposit into the existing Nourishing Young
Minds Initiative Fund, an initial sum of $100,000 to be dedicated and used for
the purposes of financing reimbursement grants issued, under the Preschool
Snack Reimbursement Grant Program, in the first year of program operations. 
The bill would further require the State Secretary of Agriculture, following
the expenditure of such initially appropriated sums, to make annually recurring
budget requests for supplemental appropriations, in an amount of $100,000 per
year, or another amount, not exceeding $1.21 multiplied by the total number of
preschoolers enrolled at all remaining eligible preschools in the State, as may
be deemed thereby to be necessary to continue the grant program and facilitate
the ongoing issuance of grant awards to eligible preschool applicants
thereunder.</p>
