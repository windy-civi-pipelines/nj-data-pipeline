Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 9 of P.L.1971, c.137 (C.5:10-9) is amended to read as follows: 9.  a.  Upon the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the compensation to be paid thereunder shall be ascertained and paid in the manner provided in chapter 1 of Title 20 of the Revised Statutes insofar as the provisions thereof are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions contained in this act.  The  authority may join in separate subdivisions in one petition or complaint the descriptions of any number of tracts or parcels of land or property to be condemned and the names of any number of owners and other parties who may have an interest therein and all such land or property included in said petition or complaint may be condemned in a single proceeding;  provided, however, that separate awards be made for each tract or parcel of land or property; and provided further, that each of said tracts or parcels of land or property lies wholly in or has a substantial part of its value lying wholly within the same county. b.  Upon the filing of such petition or complaint or at any time thereafter  the authority may file with the clerk of the county in which such property is  located and also with the Clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by the authority declaring that possession of one or more of the tracts  or parcels of land or property described in the petition or complaint is thereby being taken by and for the use of the authority.  The said declaration of taking shall be sufficient if it sets forth (1) a description of each tract or parcel of land or property to be so taken sufficient for the identification  thereof to which there shall be attached a plan or map thereof; (2) a statement of the estate or interest in the said land or property being taken; (3) a statement of the sum of money estimated by the authority by resolution to be just compensation for the taking of the estate or interest in each tract or parcel of land or property described in said declaration; and (4) that, in compliance with the provisions of the act, the authority has established and is maintaining a trust fund as hereinafter provided. c.  Upon the filing of the said declaration, the authority shall deposit with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration.  In addition to the said deposits with the Clerk of the Superior Court the authority at all times shall maintain a special trust fund on deposit with a bank or trust company doing business in the State in an  account at least equal to twice the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in  declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court.  Said trust fund shall consist of cash or securities readily convertible into cash constituting legal investment for trust funds under the laws of the State.  Said trust fund shall be held solely to secure and may be applied to the payment of just compensation for the land or other property described in such declarations of taking.  The authority shall be entitled to withdraw from said trust fund from time to time so much as may then be in excess of twice the aggregate of the amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court. d.  Upon the filing of the said declaration as aforesaid and depositing with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration, the authority without other process or proceedings, shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract of land or property described in said declaration and may forthwith enter into and take  possession of said land or property, it being the intent of this provision that the proceedings for compensation or any other proceedings relating to the taking of said land or interest therein or other property shall not delay the taking of possession thereof and the use thereof by the authority for the purpose or purposes for which the authority is authorized by law to acquire or condemn such land or other property or interest therein. e.  The authority shall cause notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit to be served upon each party in interest named in the petition residing in the State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at [his] the persons residence, if known, and upon each party in interest residing out of the State, by mailing a copy thereof to [him] the person at [his] the persons residence, if known. In the event that the residence of any such party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the land is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made within 10 days after filing such declaration.  Upon the application of any party in interest and after notice to other parties in interest, including the authority, any judge of the superior court assigned to sit for said county may order that the money deposited with  the Clerk of the Superior Court or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation  to be awarded in said proceeding; provided, that each such person shall have filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award in the condemnation proceeding shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after notice as herein provided and hearing, may determine [his] the persons liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally determined shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award is payable shall be entitled to recover from the authority the difference between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at the [then legal] rate fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) from the date of making the deposit.  If the  amount of the award shall be less than the amount so deposited, the Clerk of the Superior Court shall return the difference between the amount of the award and the deposit to the authority unless the amount of the deposit or any part  thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in which event the court, on petition of the authority and notice to all persons interested in the award and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of the authority for such difference against the party or parties liable for the return thereof.  The authority shall cause notice of the date fixed for such hearing to be served upon each party thereto residing in the State either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at [his] the persons residence, if known, and upon each party residing out of the State by mailing a copy to [him] the person at his residence, if known.  In the event that the residence of any party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the land is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made at least 10 days before the date fixed for such hearing. Whenever under chapter 1 of Title 20 of the Revised Statutes the amount of the award may be paid into court, payment may be made into the Superior Court and may be distributed according to law.  The authority shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which it has taken possession of the land or property as herein provided.

Upon the filing of the declaration and the depositing with the Clerk of the Superior Court of the amount of the estimated compensation as stated in the declaration, the State, without other process or proceedings shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract or parcel of property described in the declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said property, it being the intent of this provision that the action to fix the compensation to be paid or any other proceeding relating to the taking of  such property or entering therein shall not delay the taking of possession and  the use thereof by the State.  The commissioner shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which the State has taken possession of the property as herein provided. In the event that any party in possession fails to peaceably surrender the premises condemned within 30 days after service upon [him] the person of the notice set forth below, then, upon affidavit of the commissioner, a writ of possession shall issue forthwith from the Clerk of the Superior Court.

If the amount of the award as finally determined by the court shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award is payable shall be entitled to recover from the State the difference between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at the rate [of 6% per annum] fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) thereon from the date of the making of the deposit.  If the amount of the  award shall be less than the amount so deposited, the Clerk of the Superior  Court shall return the difference between the amount of the award and the  deposit to the commissioner unless the amount of the deposit or any part thereof shall have thereto been distributed, in which event the court, upon  application of the commissioner and notice to all parties interested in the  award and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in  favor of the State for such difference against the party or parties liable for the return thereof.

Upon the filing of the said declaration, the sewerage authority shall deposit with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration.  In addition to the said deposits with  the Clerk of the Superior Court the sewerage authority at all times shall  maintain a fund on deposit with a bank or trust company doing business in this State in an amount at least equal to the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has  not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into  court.  Said fund shall consist of cash or securities readily convertible into cash constituting legal investments for trust funds under the laws of this State or may consist of all or some part of the proceeds of bonds of the sewerage authority held by any trustee for the holders of such bonds and available for payment for the land or other property described in such declarations of taking.  Said fund shall be held by or on behalf of the sewerage authority to secure and may be applied to the payment of just compensation for the land or other property described in such declarations of taking.  The sewerage authority shall be entitled to withdraw from said fund from time to time so much as may then be in excess of the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court. Upon the filing of the said declaration as aforesaid and depositing with the  Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration, the sewerage authority, without other process or proceedings, shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract of land or property described in said declaration and may forthwith enter into and take  possession of said land or property, it being the intent of this provision that  the action to fix compensation to be paid or any other proceedings relating to the taking of said land or interest therein or other property shall not delay the taking of possession thereof and the use thereof by the sewerage authority  for the purpose or purposes for which the sewerage authority is authorized by  law to acquire or condemn such land or other property or interest therein. The sewerage authority shall cause notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit to be served upon each party to the action to fix the compensation to be paid, who resides in this State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at [his] the persons residence, if known, and upon each such party who resides out of the State, by mailing a copy thereof to [him] the person at [his] the persons residence, if known.  In the event that the residence of any such party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the land is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made within [ten] 10 days after filing such declaration.  Upon the application of any party in interest and after notice to other parties in interest, including the sewerage authority, the Superior Court may direct that the money deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in said action;  provided, that each such person shall have filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award in the said action shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after such notice as the court prescribes and hearing, may determine [his] the persons liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally determined shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award is payable shall be entitled to recover from the sewerage authority the difference between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at the rate [of 6% per annum] fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) thereon from the date of making the deposit.  If the amount of the award shall be less than the amount so deposited, the Clerk of the Superior Court shall return the difference between the amount of the award and the deposit to the sewerage authority unless the amount of the deposit or any part thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in which event the court, on application of the sewerage authority and notice to all persons interested in the award and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of the sewerage  authority for such difference against the party or parties liable for the  return thereof. The sewerage authority shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which it has taken possession of the land or property as herein provided. In addition to other powers conferred by this act or by any other law, and not in limitation thereof, every sewerage authority, in connection with construction or operation of any part of a sewerage system, shall have power to make reasonable regulations for the installation, construction, maintenance,  repair, renewal, relocation and removal of tracks, pipes, mains, conduits,  cables, wires, towers, poles or any other equipment and appliances (herein called  "facilities") of any public utility, as defined in section 48:2-13 of  the Revised Statutes, in, on, along, over or under any real property, including  public lands, waters, parks, roads, streets, highways, playgrounds and  reservations.  Whenever in connection with construction or operation of any part of a sewerage system, any sewerage authority shall determine that it is necessary that any such facilities, which now are, or hereafter may be, located  in, on, along, over or under any such real property, including public lands,  waters, parks, roads, streets, highways, playgrounds and reservations, should  be relocated in such real property, including public lands, waters, parks,  roads, streets, highways, playgrounds and reservations, or should be removed  therefrom, the public utility owning or operating such facilities shall  relocate or remove the same in accordance with the order of the sewerage  authority;  provided, however, that the cost and expenses of such relocation or  removal, including the cost of installing such facilities in a new location, or  new locations, and the cost of any lands or any rights or interest in lands or any other rights acquired to accomplish such relocation or removal, less the cost of any lands or any rights or interests in lands or any other rights of the public utility paid to the public utility in connection with the relocation  or removal of such property, shall be paid by the sewerage authority and may be included in the cost of such sewerage system.  In case of any such relocation or removal of facilities, as aforesaid, the public utility owning or operating the same, its successors or assigns, may maintain and operate such facilities, with the necessary appurtenances, in the new location or new locations for as long a period, and upon the same terms and conditions, as it had the right to maintain and operate such facilities in their former location. (cf: P.L.1956, c.113, s.1) 7.    Section 30 of P.L.1960, c.183 (C.40:37A-73) is amended to read as follows: 30.  Each authority shall cause notice of the filing of a declaration of taking of property as provided in this act and of the making of the deposit required by this act with respect thereto to be served upon each party to the action to fix the compensation to be paid who resides in the State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at [his] the persons residence if known, and upon each such party who resides out of the State, by mailing a copy thereof to [him] the person at [his] the persons residence if known.  In the event that the residence of any such party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the property is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made within 30 days after filing such declaration. Upon the application of any party in  interest and after notice to other parties in interest, including the  authority, the Superior Court may direct that the money deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person  or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in said action, provided that each such person shall have filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award in the said action shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after such notice as the court prescribes and hearing, may determine [his] the persons liability, if any, for the return of the difference or any part thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally determined shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award is payable shall be entitled to recover from the authority the difference between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at the rate [of 6% per annum] fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) thereon from the date of making the deposit.  If the  amount of the award as so determined shall be less than the amount so deposited, the Clerk of the Superior Court shall return the difference between the amount of the award and the deposit to the authority unless the deposit or any part thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in which event the court, on application of the authority and notice to all persons interested in the award and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of the authority for the difference against the party or parties liable for the return thereof. (cf: P.L.1960, c.183, s.30) 8.    Section 8 of P.L.1994, c.98 (C.40:37D-8) is amended to read as follows: 8.  a.  Upon the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the compensation to be paid thereunder shall be ascertained and paid in the manner provided in the "Eminent Domain Act of 1971," P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-1 et seq.), insofar as the provisions thereof are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions contained in this act.  The authority may join in separate subdivisions in one petition or complaint the descriptions of any number of tracts or parcels of land or property to be condemned, if each tract or parcel lies wholly in or has a substantial part of its value lying wholly within the same county, and the names of any number of owners and other parties who may have an interest therein and all the land or property included in the petition or complaint may be condemned in a single proceeding; but separate awards shall be made for each tract or parcel of land or property. b.   Upon the filing of the petition or complaint or at any time thereafter the authority may file with the clerk of the county in which the property is located and also with the clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by the authority, declaring that possession of one or more of the tracts or parcels of land or property described in the petition or complaint is being taken by and for the use of the authority. The declaration of taking shall be sufficient if it sets forth: (1) a description of each tract or parcel of land or property to be taken sufficient for the identification of it, to which there shall be attached a plan or map thereof; (2) a statement of the estate or interest in the land or property being taken; (3) a statement of the sum of money estimated by the authority by resolution to be just compensation for the taking of the estate or interest in each tract or parcel of land or property described in the declaration; and (4) that, in compliance with the provisions of this act, the authority has established and is maintaining a trust fund as hereinafter provided. c.   Upon the filing of the declaration, the authority shall deposit with the clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in the declaration.  In addition to the deposits with the clerk of the Superior Court the authority shall maintain a special trust fund on deposit with a bank or trust company doing business in the State in an amount at least equal to twice the aggregate amount deposited with the clerk of the Superior Court, as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court. The trust fund shall consist of cash or securities readily convertible into cash constituting legal investment for trust funds under the laws of the State.  The trust fund shall be held solely to secure and may be applied to the payment of just compensation for the land or other property described in the declarations of taking.  The authority shall be entitled to withdraw from the trust fund from time to time so much as may then be in excess of twice the aggregate of the amount deposited with the clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court. d.   Upon the filing of the declaration of taking pursuant to subsection b. of this section and depositing with the clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in the declaration, the authority, without other process or proceedings, shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract of land or property described in the declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of the land or property, it being the intent of this provision that the proceedings for compensation or any other proceedings relating to the taking of the land or interest therein or other property shall not delay the taking of possession thereof and the use thereof by the authority for the purposes for which the authority is authorized by law to acquire or condemn the land or other property or interest in it. e.   The authority shall cause notice of the filing of the declaration and the making of the deposit to be served upon each party in interest named in the petition residing in the State, either personally or by leaving a copy at [his] the persons residence, if known, and upon each party in interest residing out of the State, by mailing a copy to [him] the person at [his] the persons residence, if known.  If the residence of the party or the name of the party is unknown, notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the counties in which the land is located.

(d) Each authority shall cause notice of the filing of a declaration of taking of property as provided in this act and of the making of the deposit required by this act with respect thereto to be served upon each party to the action to fix the compensation to be paid who resides in the State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at [his] the persons residence if known, and upon each such party who resides out of the State, by mailing a copy thereof to [him] the person at [his] the persons residence if known.  In the event that the residence of any such party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the property is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made within 30 days after filing such declaration.

(e) The authority shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which it has taken possession of the land or property as provided in this act. (cf: P.L.1967, c.184, s.15) 12.  Section 16 of P.L.1950, c.255 (C.52:18A-65) is amended to read as follows: 16.  Upon the exercise by the Authority of the power of eminent domain pursuant to paragraph h of section [ten] 10 of [this act] P.L.1950, c.255 (C.52:18A-59), the compensation to be paid thereunder shall be ascertained and paid in the manner provided in chapter one of Title 20 of the Revised Statutes in so far as the provisions thereof are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions contained in this act. Upon the filing of the complaint in the action for condemnation or at any time thereafter the Authority may file with the Clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by the Authority, declaring that possession of one or more of the tracts or parcels of land or property described in the complaint is thereby being taken by and for the use of the Authority.  The said  declaration of taking shall be sufficient if it sets forth: (1) a description of  each tract or parcel of land or property to be so taken, sufficient for the identification thereof, to which there may or may not be attached a plan or map  thereof; (2) a statement of the estate or interest in the said land or property being taken;  (3) a statement of the sum of money estimated by the Authority by resolution to be just compensation for the taking of the estate or  interest in each tract or parcel of land or property described in said declaration;  and (4) that, in compliance with the provisions of this act, the Authority has established and is maintaining a trust fund as hereinafter provided. Upon the filing of the said declaration, the Authority shall, with leave of court, deposit with the clerk of the court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration.  In addition to the said deposits with the clerk the Authority at all times shall maintain a special trust fund on deposit with a bank or trust company doing business in this State in an amount at least equal to twice the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court. The  Authority shall be entitled to withdraw from said trust fund from time to time so much as may then be in excess of twice such aggregate amount.  Said trust fund shall consist of cash or securities readily convertible into cash constituting legal investments for trust funds under the laws of this State.  Said trust fund shall be held solely to secure and may be applied to the payment of just compensation for the land or other property described in such declaration of taking. Upon the filing of the said declaration as aforesaid and the deposit with the Clerk of the Superior Court of the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration, the Authority, without other process or proceeding,  shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract of land or  property described in said declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said land or property, it being the intent of this provision that the action for fixing compensation or any other proceeding relating to the taking of said land or interest therein or other property shall not delay the taking of possession thereof and the use thereof by the Authority for the  purpose or purposes for which the Authority is authorized by law to acquire or condemn such land or other property or interest therein. The Authority shall cause notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit to be served, as the court shall prescribe, upon each party to the action for condemnation, but not until after the filing of the declaration and the making of the deposit.  Upon the application of any party in interest and after notice to other parties in interest, including the Authority, the court may direct that the money deposited with the clerk of the court or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be adjudged to be due [him] the person in the action for condemnation;  provided, that each such person shall have  filed with the clerk of the court a consent in writing that, in the event the amount adjudged to be due [him] to the person in the condemnation action shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after notice as herein provided and hearing, may  determine [his] the persons liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount adjudged to be due [him] to the person shall exceed the amount so deposited, [he] the person shall be entitled to recover from the Authority the excess with interest at the rate [of six per centum (6%) per annum] fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) thereon from the date of making the deposit. If the amount adjudged to be due [him] to the person shall be less than the amount so deposited, the clerk of the court shall return the difference between such amounts unless the amount of the deposit or any part thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in which event the court, after such notice as it shall prescribe and an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of the Authority for such difference against the party or parties liable for the return thereof. (cf: P.L.1953, c.49, s.24) 13.  Section 13 of P.L.1958, c.34 (C.58:22-13) is amended to read as follows: 13.  Whenever the power of condemnation is exercised by the department pursuant to this act, the provisions of chapter 1 of Title 20 (Eminent Domain) of the Revised Statutes, as amended and supplemented, shall be applicable and such power of condemnation shall include the condemnation of public as well as privately owned property, except as otherwise provided by this act.  Upon the institution of an action to fix the compensation to be paid, or at any time thereafter, the department may file with the Clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by the department, declaring that the possession of 1 or more of the tracts or parcels of property described in the petition is thereby being taken by and for the use of the department.  The declaration of taking shall be sufficient if it sets forth: (1) a description of each tract or parcel of property to be taken; (2) a statement of the estate or interest in the said property being taken; and (3) a statement of the sum of money estimated by the department to be just compensation for the taking.  Upon the filing of said declaration, the department shall deposit with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration.  Upon the filing of the declaration and the depositing with the Clerk of the  Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation as stated in the declaration, the department, without other process or proceedings, shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract or parcel of property described in the declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said property, it being the intent of this provision that the action to fix the compensation to be paid or any other proceeding relating to the taking of such property or entering therein shall not delay the taking of possession and the use thereof by the department for purposes authorized by this act.  The department shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which it has taken possession of the property as herein provided.  The department shall cause notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit to be served upon each party to the action to fix the compensation to be paid, who resides in this State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at [his] the persons residence, and upon each such party who resides out of the State by mailing copy thereof to [him] the person at [his] the persons residence.  In the event that the residence of any such party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in the newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the property is located.  Such service, mailing or publishing shall be made within 10 days after the filing of the declaration.  Upon the application of any party in interest and after  notice to other parties in interest, including the department, the Superior Court may direct that the money deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court  or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in such action; provided, that each person shall have filed with the Clerk of the Superior  Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award in the action shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after such notice as the court  prescribes and a hearing, may determine the liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally determined by the court shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award is payable shall be entitled to recover from the department the difference between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at the rate [of 6% per annum] fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) thereon from the date of the making of the deposit.  If the amount  of the award shall be less than the amount so deposited, the Clerk of the Superior Court shall return the difference between the amount of the award and the deposit to the department unless the amount of the deposit or any part thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in which event the court, upon  application of the department and notice to all parties interested in the award and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of  the department for such difference against the party or parties liable for the  return thereof. (cf: P.L.1962, c.35, s.1) 14.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill replaces the fixed interest rate award in eminent domain cases with an interest rate based on just compensation awards.  Under current law, interest rate awards in certain eminent domain cases are either (1) fixed at 6 percent or (2) set at an applicable legal rate.  This bill eliminates those fixed rates and provides that the interest will be fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner after final determination of compensation.  Under the bill, in making its determination, the court may consider any relevant factors, including but not limited to: prevailing commercial interest rates, the prime rate or rates, the applicable legal rates of interest, and an appropriate interest rate on a just compensation award that justly indemnifies the condemnee for the loss of the use of the compensation to which the condemnee was entitled.

(cf: P.L.2003, c.79, s.9) 6.    Section 20 of P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-20) is amended to read as follows: 20.  Every sewerage authority is hereby empowered, in its own name but for the local unit or units, to acquire by purchase, gift, grant or devise and to take for public use real property, within or without the district, which may be deemed by the sewerage authority necessary for its purposes, including public lands, waters, parks, roads, playgrounds, reservations and public or private rights in waters within or without the district, and any property within or without the district owned by or in which any county, municipality or political  subdivision of the State, or public body or agency of such political  subdivision, has any right, title or interest.  Such sewerage authority is hereby empowered to acquire and take such real property, including any such  public property or such public interest therein, by condemnation, in the manner  provided by chapter 1 of Title 20, Eminent Domain, of the Revised Statutes  (R.S. 20:1-1 et seq.) and, to that end, may invoke and exercise in the manner or mode of procedure prescribed in said chapter, either in its own name or in  the name of any local unit or units, all of the powers of such local unit or  units to acquire or take property for public use.

The sewerage authority shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which it has taken possession of the land or property as herein provided. In addition to other powers conferred by this act or by any other law, and not in limitation thereof, every sewerage authority, in connection with construction or operation of any part of a sewerage system, shall have power to make reasonable regulations for the installation, construction, maintenance,  repair, renewal, relocation and removal of tracks, pipes, mains, conduits,  cables, wires, towers, poles or any other equipment and appliances (herein called  "facilities") of any public utility, as defined in section 48:2-13 of  the Revised Statutes, in, on, along, over or under any real property, including  public lands, waters, parks, roads, streets, highways, playgrounds and  reservations.  Whenever in connection with construction or operation of any part of a sewerage system, any sewerage authority shall determine that it is necessary that any such facilities, which now are, or hereafter may be, located  in, on, along, over or under any such real property, including public lands,  waters, parks, roads, streets, highways, playgrounds and reservations, should  be relocated in such real property, including public lands, waters, parks,  roads, streets, highways, playgrounds and reservations, or should be removed  therefrom, the public utility owning or operating such facilities shall  relocate or remove the same in accordance with the order of the sewerage  authority;  provided, however, that the cost and expenses of such relocation or  removal, including the cost of installing such facilities in a new location, or  new locations, and the cost of any lands or any rights or interest in lands or any other rights acquired to accomplish such relocation or removal, less the cost of any lands or any rights or interests in lands or any other rights of the public utility paid to the public utility in connection with the relocation  or removal of such property, shall be paid by the sewerage authority and may be included in the cost of such sewerage system.  In case of any such relocation or removal of facilities, as aforesaid, the public utility owning or operating the same, its successors or assigns, may maintain and operate such facilities, with the necessary appurtenances, in the new location or new locations for as long a period, and upon the same terms and conditions, as it had the right to maintain and operate such facilities in their former location.

Upon the filing of the aforesaid declaration of taking and the deposit in court to the use of the persons entitled thereto, of the sum of money estimated  by the municipality to be just compensation for the property taken as stated  above, title to the property described as being taken by said declaration shall vest in the municipality (free from the right, title, interest or lien of all  persons), and said property shall be deemed to be condemned and taken for the use of the municipality and the right to just compensation for the same shall  vest in the persons entitled thereto. Upon the filing of the declaration of taking and the making of the deposit as aforesaid, the court shall designate a day not exceeding 90 days after such filing, except for good cause shown, on which persons in possession shall be required to surrender possession to the municipality. Upon the expiration of the period designated by the court as herein provided, the municipality, without other process or proceedings shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract or parcel of property described in the declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said property, it being the intent of this provision that the action to fix the compensation to be paid or any other proceeding relating to the taking of such property or entering therein shall not delay the taking of possession and the use thereof by the municipality for purposes authorized by this act.  The municipality shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding pursuant to this act subsequent to the date upon which it has taken possession of the property as herein provided.

Any party in interest after notice to other parties in interest, including the municipality, may make application to a judge of the Superior Court who may order that the money deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court, or any  part thereof, be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in said proceeding; provided, that each such person shall have filed with Clerk of the Superior Court a consent in writing and such security as may be required by the court that, in the event the award in the condemnation proceeding shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after notice and hearing as herein provided, may determine the liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part thereof and enter judgment therefor. The ultimate amount of compensation shall be determined pursuant to Title 20 of the Revised Statutes. If the amount so fixed shall exceed the amount so  deposited in court by the municipality or otherwise paid to the persons entitled thereto, the court shall enter judgment against the municipality in the amount of such deficiency, together with interest at the [legal] rate fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) on such  deficiency from the date of the vesting of title to the date of the entry of  the final judgment (subject, however, to abatement for use, income, rents or  profits derived from such property by the owner thereof subsequent to the  vesting of title in the municipality), and the court shall order the municipality to deposit the amount of such deficiency in court.  The money deposited into court by a municipality shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by the court and shall be disbursed according to the order or judgment of the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by the final award or judgment of the court. In case the amount deposited in court by the municipality as the estimated compensation for the property shall exceed the amount of the award or judgment, such excess shall be returned to the municipality, unless the amount of the deposit or any part thereof shall have been distributed as aforesaid, in which event, the court, on petition of the municipality and notice to all persons interested in the award and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of the municipality for such difference against the party or parties liable for the return thereof.  The municipality shall cause notice of the date, fixed for such hearing, to be served upon each party thereto residing in this State in accordance with the requirements of the laws of this State relating to service of process.  In the event that the residence of any party or the name of any party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county in which the property is located.  Such service, mailing or publication, shall be made at least 10 days before the date fixed for such hearing.

Any party in interest after notice to other parties in interest, including the county, may make application to a judge of the Superior Court who may order  that the money deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court, or any part  thereof, be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on  account of the just compensation to be awarded in said proceeding; provided, that each such person shall have filed with Clerk of the Superior Court a  consent in writing and such security as may be required by the court that, in the event the award in the condemnation proceeding shall be less than the  amount deposited, the court, after notice and hearing as herein provided, may  determine the liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part  thereof and enter judgment therefor. The ultimate amount of compensation shall be determined pursuant to the Eminent Domain Act of 1971, P.L.1971, c. 361 (C. 20:3-1 et seq.).  If the amount so fixed shall exceed the amount so deposited in court by the county or otherwise paid to the persons entitled thereto, the court shall enter judgment against the county in the amount of such deficiency, together with interest at the [legal] rate fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) on such deficiency from the date of the vesting of title to the date of the entry of the final judgment (subject, however, to abatement for use, income, rents or profits derived from such property by the owner thereof subsequent to the vesting of title in the county), and the court shall order the county to deposit the amount of such deficiency in court.  The money deposited into court by a county shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by the court and shall be disbursed according to the order or judgment of the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by the final award or judgment of the court.  In case the amount deposited in court by the county as  the estimated compensation for the property shall exceed the amount of the  award or judgment, such excess shall be returned to the county unless the  amount of the deposit or any part thereof shall have been distributed as  aforesaid, in which event, the court, on petition of the county and notice to  all persons interested in the award and affording them an opportunity to be  heard, shall enter judgment in favor of the county for such difference against  the party or parties liable for the return thereof.

(cf: P.L.1977, c.319, s.1) 11.  Section 15 of P.L.1967, c.184 (C.40:68-41) is amended to read as follows: 15.  The district, its agents, officers, engineers or others in its employ, may enter at all times upon all lands or waters for the purpose of making surveys, borings, soundings and examinations for the purpose of the district, doing no unnecessary injury to private or other property.  When the district shall have determined upon the construction of any particular project facility or structure authorized by this act, it may proceed to condemn and take land or water rights and structures necessary therefor in accordance with chapter 1 of Title 20, of the Revised Statutes (Eminent Domain) and may also proceed to acquire, purchase, take and hold such voluntary grants of real estate, riparian  rights and other property above or under water as may be necessary to complete  said project. (a) Upon the filing by an authority of a complaint in any action to fix the compensation to be paid for any property or at any time thereafter, the authority may file with the clerk of the county in which such property is located and also with the Clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by the authority, declaring that possession of one or more of the tracts or parcels of land or property described in the complaint is thereby being taken by and for the use of the authority.  The said declaration of taking shall be sufficient if it sets forth: (a) a description of each tract or parcel of land or property to be so taken sufficient for the identification thereof to which there may or may not be attached a plan or map thereof, (b) a statement  of the estate or interest in the said land or property being taken, (c) a  statement of the sum of money estimated by the authority by resolution to be just compensation for the taking of the estate or interest in each tract or parcel of land or property described in said declaration, and (d) an allegation that, in compliance with the provisions of this act, the authority has established and is maintaining a trust fund as hereinafter provided. (b) Upon the filing by an authority of a declaration of taking of property as provided in this act, the authority shall deposit with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in such declaration.  In addition to the said deposits with the Clerk of the Superior Court, the authority at all times shall maintain a fund on deposit with a bank or trust company doing business in the State in an amount at least equal to the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court.  Said fund shall consist of cash or securities readily convertible into cash constituting legal investments for trust funds under the laws of the State or may consist of all or some part of the proceeds of bonds of the authority held by any trustee for the holders of such bonds and available for payment for the land or other property described in such declarations of taking.  Said fund shall be held by or on behalf of the authority to secure and may be applied to the payment of just compensation for the land or other property described in such declarations of taking.  The authority shall be entitled to withdraw from said fund from time to time so much as may then be in excess of the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all land or other property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court. (c) Upon the filing by an authority of a declaration of taking of property as provided in this act and the depositing with the Clerk of the Superior Court of the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration, the authority, without other process or proceedings, shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract of land or property described in said declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said land or property, it being the intent of this provision that the action to fix compensation to be paid or any other proceedings relating to the taking of said  land or interest therein or other property shall not delay the taking of possession thereof and the use thereof by the authority for the purpose or purposes for which the authority is authorized by law to acquire or condemn such land or other property or interest therein. (d) Each authority shall cause notice of the filing of a declaration of taking of property as provided in this act and of the making of the deposit required by this act with respect thereto to be served upon each party to the action to fix the compensation to be paid who resides in the State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at [his] the persons residence if known, and upon each such party who resides out of the State, by mailing a copy thereof to [him] the person at [his] the persons residence if known.  In the event that the residence of any such party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the property is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made within 30 days after filing such declaration. Upon the application of any party in interest and after notice to other parties in interest, including the authority, the Superior Court may direct that the money deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in such action, provided that each such person shall have filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award in the said action shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after such notice as the court prescribes and hearing, may determine [his] the persons liability, if any, for the return of the difference or any part thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally determined shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award is payable shall be entitled to recover from the authority the difference between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at the rate [of 6% per annum] fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) thereon from the date of making the deposit.  If the amount of the award as so determined shall be less than the amount so deposited, the Clerk of the Superior Court shall return the difference between  the amount of the award and the deposit to the authority unless the deposit or  any part thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in which event the court, on application of the authority and notice to all persons interested in  the award and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of the authority for the difference against the party or parties liable for the return thereof. (e) The authority shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which it has taken possession of the land or property as provided in this act. (cf: P.L.1967, c.184, s.15) 12.  Section 16 of P.L.1950, c.255 (C.52:18A-65) is amended to read as follows: 16.  Upon the exercise by the Authority of the power of eminent domain pursuant to paragraph h of section [ten] 10 of [this act] P.L.1950, c.255 (C.52:18A-59), the compensation to be paid thereunder shall be ascertained and paid in the manner provided in chapter one of Title 20 of the Revised Statutes in so far as the provisions thereof are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions contained in this act. Upon the filing of the complaint in the action for condemnation or at any time thereafter the Authority may file with the Clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by the Authority, declaring that possession of one or more of the tracts or parcels of land or property described in the complaint is thereby being taken by and for the use of the Authority.  The said  declaration of taking shall be sufficient if it sets forth: (1) a description of  each tract or parcel of land or property to be so taken, sufficient for the identification thereof, to which there may or may not be attached a plan or map  thereof; (2) a statement of the estate or interest in the said land or property being taken;  (3) a statement of the sum of money estimated by the Authority by resolution to be just compensation for the taking of the estate or  interest in each tract or parcel of land or property described in said declaration;  and (4) that, in compliance with the provisions of this act, the Authority has established and is maintaining a trust fund as hereinafter provided. Upon the filing of the said declaration, the Authority shall, with leave of court, deposit with the clerk of the court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration.  In addition to the said deposits with the clerk the Authority at all times shall maintain a special trust fund on deposit with a bank or trust company doing business in this State in an amount at least equal to twice the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court. The  Authority shall be entitled to withdraw from said trust fund from time to time so much as may then be in excess of twice such aggregate amount.  Said trust fund shall consist of cash or securities readily convertible into cash constituting legal investments for trust funds under the laws of this State.  Said trust fund shall be held solely to secure and may be applied to the payment of just compensation for the land or other property described in such declaration of taking. Upon the filing of the said declaration as aforesaid and the deposit with the Clerk of the Superior Court of the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration, the Authority, without other process or proceeding,  shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract of land or  property described in said declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said land or property, it being the intent of this provision that the action for fixing compensation or any other proceeding relating to the taking of said land or interest therein or other property shall not delay the taking of possession thereof and the use thereof by the Authority for the  purpose or purposes for which the Authority is authorized by law to acquire or condemn such land or other property or interest therein. The Authority shall cause notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit to be served, as the court shall prescribe, upon each party to the action for condemnation, but not until after the filing of the declaration and the making of the deposit.  Upon the application of any party in interest and after notice to other parties in interest, including the Authority, the court may direct that the money deposited with the clerk of the court or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be adjudged to be due [him] the person in the action for condemnation;  provided, that each such person shall have  filed with the clerk of the court a consent in writing that, in the event the amount adjudged to be due [him] to the person in the condemnation action shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after notice as herein provided and hearing, may  determine [his] the persons liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount adjudged to be due [him] to the person shall exceed the amount so deposited, [he] the person shall be entitled to recover from the Authority the excess with interest at the rate [of six per centum (6%) per annum] fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) thereon from the date of making the deposit. If the amount adjudged to be due [him] to the person shall be less than the amount so deposited, the clerk of the court shall return the difference between such amounts unless the amount of the deposit or any part thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in which event the court, after such notice as it shall prescribe and an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of the Authority for such difference against the party or parties liable for the return thereof. (cf: P.L.1953, c.49, s.24) 13.  Section 13 of P.L.1958, c.34 (C.58:22-13) is amended to read as follows: 13.  Whenever the power of condemnation is exercised by the department pursuant to this act, the provisions of chapter 1 of Title 20 (Eminent Domain) of the Revised Statutes, as amended and supplemented, shall be applicable and such power of condemnation shall include the condemnation of public as well as privately owned property, except as otherwise provided by this act.  Upon the institution of an action to fix the compensation to be paid, or at any time thereafter, the department may file with the Clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by the department, declaring that the possession of 1 or more of the tracts or parcels of property described in the petition is thereby being taken by and for the use of the department.  The declaration of taking shall be sufficient if it sets forth: (1) a description of each tract or parcel of property to be taken; (2) a statement of the estate or interest in the said property being taken; and (3) a statement of the sum of money estimated by the department to be just compensation for the taking.  Upon the filing of said declaration, the department shall deposit with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration.  Upon the filing of the declaration and the depositing with the Clerk of the  Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation as stated in the declaration, the department, without other process or proceedings, shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract or parcel of property described in the declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said property, it being the intent of this provision that the action to fix the compensation to be paid or any other proceeding relating to the taking of such property or entering therein shall not delay the taking of possession and the use thereof by the department for purposes authorized by this act.  The department shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which it has taken possession of the property as herein provided.  The department shall cause notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit to be served upon each party to the action to fix the compensation to be paid, who resides in this State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at [his] the persons residence, and upon each such party who resides out of the State by mailing copy thereof to [him] the person at [his] the persons residence.  In the event that the residence of any such party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in the newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the property is located.  Such service, mailing or publishing shall be made within 10 days after the filing of the declaration.  Upon the application of any party in interest and after  notice to other parties in interest, including the department, the Superior Court may direct that the money deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court  or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in such action; provided, that each person shall have filed with the Clerk of the Superior  Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award in the action shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after such notice as the court  prescribes and a hearing, may determine the liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally determined by the court shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award is payable shall be entitled to recover from the department the difference between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at the rate [of 6% per annum] fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-32) thereon from the date of the making of the deposit.  If the amount  of the award shall be less than the amount so deposited, the Clerk of the Superior Court shall return the difference between the amount of the award and the deposit to the department unless the amount of the deposit or any part thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in which event the court, upon  application of the department and notice to all parties interested in the award and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of  the department for such difference against the party or parties liable for the  return thereof. (cf: P.L.1962, c.35, s.1) 14.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill replaces the fixed interest rate award in eminent domain cases with an interest rate based on just compensation awards.  Under current law, interest rate awards in certain eminent domain cases are either (1) fixed at 6 percent or (2) set at an applicable legal rate.  This bill eliminates those fixed rates and provides that the interest will be fixed and determined by the court in a summary manner after final determination of compensation.  Under the bill, in making its determination, the court may consider any relevant factors, including but not limited to: prevailing commercial interest rates, the prime rate or rates, the applicable legal rates of interest, and an appropriate interest rate on a just compensation award that justly indemnifies the condemnee for the loss of the use of the compensation to which the condemnee was entitled.
