SJR11 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION No. 11 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  BOB SMITH District 17 (Middlesex and Somerset) SYNOPSIS Designates first week of May of each year as Composting Awareness Week in New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Joint Resolution designating the first week of May of each year as Composting Awareness Week in New Jersey. Whereas, Compost, a mixture made of organic materials such as yard trimmings, vegetable and fruit peels and scraps, other food scraps, flowers, eggshells, paper products, nutshells, saw dust, wood chips, biosolids, manure, hay shavings, and leaves, is rich in moisture and nutrients, and added to the soil in gardens and farms to help plants and crops grow; and Whereas, Compost retains and transfers moisture through the soil to the plant, which minimizes the need for irrigation, reduces water usage by up to 30 percent, conserves water during droughts, and prevents flooding by retaining water that would otherwise enter drains and sewers; and Whereas, Compost is rich in nutrients and organisms beneficial for plant health and growth, such as worms, centipedes, spiders, beetles, and fungal mycelium, which minimizes the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and reduces soil and water pollution; and Whereas, Composting reduces waste by reusing and recycling organic materials, which make up approximately 30 percent of all materials sent to landfills, and can help communities that implement composting programs to efficiently divert waste from landfills and become more sustainable; and Whereas, The beneficial organisms and microbes in compost sequester and retain carbon in the soil, and prevent carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, which would otherwise be produced in large amounts by decomposing waste in landfills, from being released into the atmosphere; and Whereas, Using compost in certain public works projects, such as the construction and improvement of parks, trails, highways, and green spaces, can lead to large-scale reductions in pollution, help prevent climate change, and lead to the creation of green jobs; and Whereas, The threat of and importance of action against climate change was recognized by Governor Murphy through Executive Order No. 100, which recognizes that New Jersey is especially vulnerable to climate change caused by greenhouse gases, and Executive Order No. 221, which establishes the Office of Climate Action and Green Economy to coordinate policymaking processes with respect to climate change and green economy issues; and Whereas, The Department of Environmental Protection released strategies, including strategies involving composting, to reduce and remove carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere in New Jerseys Global Warming Response Act, 80x50 Report, moreover, the recently enacted P.L.2020, c.24 will help increase composting rates by requiring large food generators producing more than 52 tons of food waste per year to recycle food waste through various methods, including composting; and Whereas, The first week of May is internationally recognized as Composting Awareness Week; and Whereas, The State of New Jersey can recognize the importance of composting in nourishing essential plants and crops, mitigating the effects of climate change, conserving water, preventing flooding, recycling waste, preventing pollution, and creating green jobs, and further encourage composting by businesses and individuals, by designating the first week of May as Composting Awareness Week in New Jersey; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The first week of May of each year is designated as Composting Awareness Week in the State of New Jersey to recognize the importance of composting. 2.  The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation recognizing the first week of May of each year as Composting Awareness Week in New Jersey, and call upon public officials and citizens of this State to observe the day with appropriate activities and programs. 3.  This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution designates the first week of May of each year as Composting Awareness Week in the State of New Jersey. This joint resolution also respectfully requests the Governor to annually issue a proclamation calling upon public officials and citizens of this State to observe Composting Awareness Week with appropriate activities and programs.  Compost is a mixture made of organic materials that is added to the soil in gardens and farms to increase soil fertility and nourish plants and crops.  Compost is rich in nutrients and organisms beneficial for plant health and growth, and naturally retains a lot of moisture.  The nutrients and benefits provided by compost minimizes the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which can significantly reduce soil and water pollution.  The moisture retained by compost is transferred through the soil to the plant.  As a result, composting reduces the need for irrigation, can reduce water usage by up to 30 percent, conserves water during droughts, and prevents flooding by retaining water that would otherwise enter drains and sewers.  In addition, composting reduces waste by reusing and recycling organic materials, which make up approximately 30 percent of all materials sent to landfills, and can help communities that implement composting programs to efficiently divert waste from landfills and become more sustainable. Composting can help mitigate climate change.  The beneficial organisms and microbes in compost sequester and retain carbon in the soil, and prevent carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases from being released into the atmosphere.  Greenhouse gases are produced in large amounts by decomposing waste in landfills that could otherwise be recycled into compost.  In addition, using compost in certain public works projects, such as the construction and improvement of parks, trails, highways, and green spaces, can lead to large-scale reductions in pollution, help prevent climate change, and lead to the creation of green jobs.  The threat of climate change was recognized by Governor Murphy through Executive Order No. 100, which recognizes that New Jersey is especially vulnerable to climate change caused by greenhouse gases. The importance of taking action to mitigate climate change was also recognized by Governor Murphy in Executive Order No. 221, which establishes the Office of Climate Action and Green Economy to coordinate policymaking processes with respect to climate change and green economy issues.  The Department of Environmental Protection released strategies, including strategies involving composting, in New Jerseys Global Warming Response Act, 80x50 Report to reduce and remove carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere.  In addition, P.L.2020, c.24 encourages composting by requiring large food generators producing more than 52 tons of food waste per year to recycle food waste through various methods, including composting.  The first week of May is internationally recognized as Composting Awareness Week.  The State of New Jersey can recognize the importance of composting and further encourage composting by businesses and individuals by designating the first week of May as Composting Awareness Week in New Jersey.
