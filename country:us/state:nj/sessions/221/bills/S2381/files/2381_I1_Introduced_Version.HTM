shall be evidenced by certificates of trust and credited to the holding account
of the Common Pension Fund as provided in section 9 of P.L.    , c.

practicable, including the sale of certificates to other pension systems, so
long as such sale does not impair the tax status of the fund or the assets. 
The terms of the certificates of trust shall provide for a continuous accurate

)(pending before the Legislature as this bill) and exclude amounts deposited to
the investment account from, or associated with, the conveyed asset.  The

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, known as the New
Jersey Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund Act,
establishes a trust fund for the conveyance of certain assets for the benefit
of the State-administered retirement systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The fund, known as the
Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise (ICARE) Fund, is
established as an instrumentality of the State to exercise public and essential
governmental functions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of the fund is to
lessen the burdens of government by providing a fund through which a public
entity may contribute, transfer or sell its revenue-producing assets, to a
segregated or commingled account and share the risks and benefits of the
performance of those assets, to maximize the performance and long-term value of
those assets and to benefit the public entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The fund will be administered
by an Administrator retained, appointed, or procured by the Infrastructure
Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund.  The assets of the fund will be
maintained as a separate account segregated from all other funds of the State,
the administrator and the non-State public employers participating in
State-administered retirement systems.  The fund will be legally independent
and separate, regardless of its treatment for tax, accounting, reporting,
securities law, or other purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No person will use or
authorize the use of the assets in the fund, or the investment earnings, for
any purpose other than for the maximization of the value of the assets in the
fund, including meeting or exceeding the level of service required to operate
the asset pursuant to State and federal law and regulations for the safety of
the public and the environment, and for the benefit of members and retirees in
the State-administered retirement systems, and for the reasonable costs of
administering the fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The ICARE Fund will have a board
of five members as follows: a member of the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank, a
member of the Division of Investments or their designee, who will serve ex
officio, and three members of the public appointed by the Governor.  Members
appointed by the Governor should have experience and expertise in ERISA law and
laws governing public pension plans, experience and expertise in pension
finance or experience and expertise in the construction trades.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each public member will be
appointed for a term of three years, with staggered terms.  Members will remain
active until their successor is qualified.  The chairperson will be determined
by the Governor and the director of the Division of Investment will serve as
treasurer of the board and as vice chairperson of the board.  The position of
secretary will be elected from among the three public members of the board. 
The term for secretary will be three years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The board will be constituted
as an instrumentality of the State exercising public and essential governmental
functions, and the exercise by the board of the powers conferred by this bill will
be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The members of the ICARE Fund
will serve without compensation, but the fund will reimburse the members for
actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes an
advisory committee to the board comprised of each municipality or county which
is a benefitting public entity.  The advisory committee members will serve for
two years.  Members of the advisory committee will be appointed by the
secretary of the board upon the recommendation from the executive of the public
entity.  All public information that is distributed to board members relative
to board meetings will also be provided simultaneously to the advisory
committee members.  The purpose of the advisory committee is to provide the
board with advice and information relevant to local systems.  The advisory
committee will not have any voting or veto authority over the board.  The
advisory committee members will receive no compensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The fund administrator will
have a fiduciary duty to maximize the value of an asset over the long-term, to
the holders of certificates of trust issued pursuant to this bill.  The
administrator will ensure that each asset meets or exceeds the level of service
required to operate the asset pursuant to State and federal law and regulations
for the safety of the public and the environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
public entity may convey to the fund an asset held by the public entity.  The
conveyance will be governed by a transfer agreement, which will be proposed by
the administrator, in consultation with the board, and approved by the public
entity.  Only that portion of the conveyed asset that is net of financing costs
and amounts deposited into the investment account or other distributions made
to, or on behalf of the public entity will be evidenced by certificates of
trust and credited to the holding account of the Common Pension Fund as
provided by this bill.  Asset contributions on behalf of the public entity and
the funds asset distributions will be deposited in the investment account of
the Common Pension Fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The State-administered
retirement systems will not be required or permitted to pay any expenses
incurred in connection with the conveyance of an asset pursuant to this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An asset proposed for
conveyance to the fund will be valued by an independent valuation agent and be
revalued periodically.  The valuation agent will issue a report representing
its opinion as to the valuation of the asset in accordance with an asset
conveyance.  An asset conveyance will not be effectuated until after the report
has been issued and both the fund manager, upon approval from the board, and
the public entity or non-public entity accept the proposed value.  If either
rejects the proposed value, the conveyance will not be effectuated, and any
written agreement for the conveyance of an asset will be void.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends the Water
Infrastructure Protection Act, to allow a municipality with a water or wastewater
asset under emergent conditions to include conveyance of the asset to the fund
as an option under that law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill appropriates
$20,000,000 to the ICARE fund for the operating and administrative expenses of
the fund and for the performance by the administrator and the board of their
responsibilities.</p>
