(2)  A municipality may impose a separate local licensing or endorsement requirement as a part of its restrictions on the number of cannabis establishments, distributors, or delivery services, or their location, manner, or times of operation.  A municipality that imposes a separate local licensing or endorsement requirement shall establish a reasonable timeline for the approval or denial of an application to operate one or more classes of cannabis establishments permitted by local ordinance which shall not exceed 90-days from the submission of a complete application to the municipality. A municipality may decline to impose any local licensing or endorsement requirements, but a local jurisdiction shall notify the commission that it either approves or denies each application forwarded to it. (3)  A municipality shall notify the commission upon the enactment of an ordinance by the municipality that permits or prohibits the operation of any one or more classes of cannabis establishment, or cannabis distributors, or cannabis delivery services.  The notification shall specify the class of cannabis establishment being permitted or prohibited to operate in the municipality and any limitation on the number of any class of cannabis establishments permitted by the municipality. (cf: P.L.2021, c.16, s.31). 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires municipalities to establish a timeline for application review and requires municipalities to notify Cannabis Regulatory Commission when allowing cannabis businesses to operate in a municipality.
