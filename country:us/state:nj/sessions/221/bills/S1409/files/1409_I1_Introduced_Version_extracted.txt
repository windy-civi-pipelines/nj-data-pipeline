Section 1:
S1409 SENATE, No. 1409 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  TROY SINGLETON District 7 (Burlington) Co-Sponsored by: Senator Cruz-Perez SYNOPSIS Revises number of qualified disabled veterans businesses required to designate set-aside contract from three to two. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning set-aside contracts for disabled veterans and amending P.L.2015, c.116. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 4 of P.L.2015, c.116 (C.52:32-31.4) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any State bidding or public contracts laws to the contrary, but subject to any supervening federal statutes or rules, contracting agencies, in consultation with the department, may designate a contract, or a portion thereof, for goods, equipment, construction or services to be awarded by a contracting agency as a disabled veterans' business set-aside contract pursuant to the goals and procedures established in this act, whenever there is a reasonable expectation that bids may be obtained from at least [three] two qualified disabled veterans' businesses capable of furnishing the desired goods, equipment, construction or services at a fair and reasonable price.  The designation shall be made prior to the advertisement for bids. b.    When application of the goals and procedures established under this act would jeopardize the State's participation in a program from which the State receives federal funds or other benefits, the contracting agency may, in consultation with the department, withdraw the affected contracts from consideration or calculation. (cf: P.L.2015, c.116, s.4) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill revises the number of qualified disabled veterans businesses required to set aside a contract under the Set-Aside Act for Disabled Veterans Businesses from three businesses to two businesses. Designating set-aside contracts for disabled veterans businesses is difficult given the relatively low number of registered disabled veterans businesses in this State. Neighboring states as well as the federal government use a rule of two when designating set-aside contracts for disabled veterans businesses.  This bill updates New Jerseys requirements to reduce the number of businesses needed to designate a set-aside contract from three to two.
