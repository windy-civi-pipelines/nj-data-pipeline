<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the Graduate
Physician Licensing Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, the State
Board of Medical Examiners (board) will issue a license as a graduate physician
to an applicant who, among other things:  1) is at least 18 years of age; 2) is
a medical school graduate; 3) has successfully completed Step 2 of the physician
licensing examination; 4) has not completed an approved postgraduate residency;
and 5) has no criminal history.  Alternatively, the board may accept proof that
an applicant holds a current graduate physician license in a state which has
standards substantially equivalent to those of New Jersey. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Graduate physicians will be
authorized to provide primary care services in medically underserved areas of
the State, subject to any restrictions set forth in a collaborative practice
arrangement with a collaborating physician, who is responsible for supervising
the graduate physician at all times.  The delivery of health care services is to
be within the scope of practice of the graduate physician and consistent with
that graduate physician's skill, training, and competence and the skill and
training of the collaborating physician.  Graduate physicians may be delegated
the authority to prescribe controlled dangerous substances and authorize
patients for medical cannabis, subject to certain restrictions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires health
benefits plans, the Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare programs, and the State Health
Benefits Program and the School Employees Health Benefits Program, to
reimburse a graduate physician for the diagnosis, consultation, or treatment of
patients on the same basis that reimbursement is provided for the service when
it is delivered by another comparable mid-level health provider including, but
not limited to, a physician assistant.</p>
