STATEMENT This bill directs the Commissioner of the Department of Human Services to collect manage the collection of data on Haitian migrants in New Jersey, no matter their documentation status, from various sources such as federal, State, and local governments, and non-profit organizations. Haitian migrants in New Jersey have fled political unrest and financial trouble to live a safe and prosperous life in this State.  Their journeys, whether they be by boat or on foot, are long and dangerous, sometimes leading to injury or death.  New Jersey has the fourth largest Haitian-American population in the United States, as about 69,000 Haitian-Americans live in this State.  As some of the Haitian migrants living in New Jersey are undocumented, it is difficult to know how many need assistance.  Collecting data on Haitian migrants living in New Jersey, no matter their documentation status, will allow the State to help them more efficiently. This bill would take effect on the 60th day following enactment.
