of the parent or guardian with whom the child lived prior to his most recent
admission to a State facility or most recent placement by a State agency.</p>

guardian of a student shall notify the sending district of the student's
intention to participate in the choice program and shall submit an application
to the choice district, indicating the school the student wishes to attend, no
later than the date specified by the commissioner.  To be eligible to
participate in the program, a student shall be enrolled at the time of
application in grades preschool through 12 in a school of the sending district
and have attended school in the sending district for at least one full year
immediately preceding enrollment in the choice district, provided that a
&quot;sending district&quot; includes any school district that a student in a
particular district of residence is required by law to attend.  The one-year
requirement shall not apply to a student enrolling in preschool or kindergarten
in the choice district, if that student has a sibling enrolled in the choice district<u>,
or to a military-connected student</u>.  Openings in a designated school of a
choice district shall be on a space-available basis, and if more applications
are received for a designated school than there are spaces available, a lottery
shall be held to determine the selection of students.  Preference for
enrollment may be given to siblings of students who are enrolled in a
designated school <u>and military-connected students</u>.</p>

designated school of a choice district and there is no student who is enrolled
in a sending district who meets the attendance requirements of this subsection,
including a student who has been placed on a waiting list based on a lottery
held in the choice district, then the choice district may fill that opening
with a public school student who does not meet the attendance requirements of
this subsection or a nonpublic school student.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A choice district may
evaluate a prospective student on the student's interest in the program offered
by a designated school.  The district shall not discriminate in its admission
policies or practices on the basis of athletic ability, intellectual aptitude,
English language proficiency, status as a  person with a disability, <u>status
as a military-connected student,</u> or any basis prohibited by State or
federal law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A choice district shall
not prohibit the enrollment of a student based upon a determination that the
additional cost of educating the student would exceed the amount of additional
State aid received as a result of the student's enrollment.  A choice district
may reject the application for enrollment of a student who has been classified
as eligible for special education services pursuant to chapter 46 of Title 18A
of the New Jersey Statutes if that student's individualized education program
could not be implemented in the district, or if the enrollment of that student
would require the district to fundamentally alter the nature of its educational
program, or would create an undue financial or administrative burden on the
district.</p>

enrolled in a designated school, the student shall not be required to reapply
each school year for enrollment in any designated school of the choice district

shall be permitted to transfer back to a school of the sending district or may
apply to a different choice district during the next application period.</p>

accept all of the credits earned toward graduation by a student in the schools
