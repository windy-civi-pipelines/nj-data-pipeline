Presently, the hiring preference for a civil service position is given by law only to a veteran who served in time of war.  The preference is also given by law to a spouse or parent of an eligible veteran in certain cases.  The amendment would allow the Legislature to pass a law granting a civil service hiring preference to a veteran who did not serve in time of war. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution proposes an amendment to the New Jersey Constitution to allow the Legislature to enact a law to extend the preference given to veterans for hiring for civil service positions.  The law would determine the eligibility of veterans for the purpose of hiring preferences for civil service positions. Currently, only veterans who served in time of war receive a hiring preference when applying for civil service positions.  This amendment would allow veterans who did not serve in time of war also to receive a hiring preference for civil service positions.
