specified in subsection b. of this section, to:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) persons who, regardless of
where they reside (except for nonresident certificate holders under group
policies or contracts), are the beneficiaries, assignees or payees, including
health care providers rendering services covered under health insurance
policies or certificates, of the persons covered under paragraph (2) of this
subsection; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) persons who are owners of
or certificate holders or enrollees under those policies or contracts (other
than unallocated annuity contracts, and structured settlement annuities) and in
each case who:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) are residents, or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) are not residents, but
only if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i) the member insurers which
issued the policies or contracts are domiciled in this State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii) those member insurers, health
service corporations, hospital service corporations, medical service
corporations, or health maintenance organizations never held a license or
certificate of authority in the states in which those persons reside;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii) those states have
associations and coverage provisions with respect to residency similar to the
association created by P.L.1991, c.208 (C.17B:32A-1 et seq.); and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iv) those persons are not
eligible for coverage by those associations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) For unallocated annuity
contracts specified in subsection b. of this section, paragraphs (1) and (2) of
this subsection shall not apply, and P.L.1991, c.208 (C.17B:32A-1 et seq.)
shall (except as provided in paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection) provide
coverage to persons who are the owners of the unallocated annuity contracts:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) if the contracts are
issued to or in connection with a specific benefit plan whose plan sponsor has
its principal place of business in this State; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) issued to or in connection
with government lotteries if the owners are residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) For structured settlement
annuities specified in subsection b. of this section, paragraphs (1) and (2) of
this subsection shall not apply, and P.L.1991, c.208 (C.17B:32A-1 et seq.)
shall (except as provided in paragraphs (5) and (6) of this subsection) provide
coverage to a person who is a payee under a structured settlement annuity (or
beneficiary of a payee if the payee is deceased) if the payee:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) is a resident, regardless
of where the contract owner resides; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) is not a resident, but
only under both of the following conditions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i) the contract owner of the
structured settlement annuity is a resident or is not a resident but the
insurer that issued the settlement annuity is domiciled in New Jersey and the
state in which the contract owner resides has an association similar to the
association created by P.L.1991, c.208 (C.17B:32A-1 et seq.); and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii) the payee (or
beneficiary) and the contract owner are not eligible for coverage by the
association of the state in which the payee or contract owner resides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) P.L.1991, c.208
(C.17B:32A-1 et seq.) shall not provide coverage to a person:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) who is a payee (or
beneficiary) of a contract owner resident of this State, if the payee (or
beneficiary) is afforded any coverage by the association of another state;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) covered under paragraph
(3) of this subsection, if any coverage is provided by the association of
another state to the person; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c) who acquires rights to
receive payments through a structured settlement factoring transaction as
defined in section 5891 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.
s.5891(c)(3)(A), regardless of whether the transaction occurred before or after
that section became effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) P.L.1991, c.208
(C.17B:32A-1 et seq.) is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a
resident of this State and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident.  In
order to avoid duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive
coverage under P.L.1991, c.208 (C.17B:32A-1 et seq.) is provided coverage under
the law of another state, the person shall not be provided coverage under

The costs of the obligation of the association under P.L.1991, c.208

policies or reimbursed to the association pursuant to its subrogation and

member insurer had it not been insolvent.  The obligations of solvent member
insurers to pay all or part of the covered claim are not diminished by the
forgiveness provided in this subsection.  The association is not bound by an
assignment of benefits executed with respect to the coverage provided by the
insolvent insurer.  The association may aggregate all claims owed health care
providers when negotiating direct payment of claims of all covered individuals.
