(3)   The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement provisions in this act, and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this section in an amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate. f.     A producer who violates any provision of section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection b. of this section, or a court order issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or who fails to pay a civil administrative penalty in full pursuant to subsection d. of this section, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement on any application, record, report, or other document required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day of the violation, and each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected with costs in a summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), or may be collected in a civil action commenced by the commissioner.  In addition to any penalties, costs, or interest charges, the Superior Court, or the municipal court as the case may be, may assess against the violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the violation. 5.    Section 4 of P.L.1991, c.520 (C.13:1E-99.47) is amended to read as follows: 4.  a.  On or after January 1, 1993, no person shall sell, offer for sale, or offer for promotional purposes in this State any package or packaging component which includes, in the package itself or in any packaging component, inks, dyes, pigments, adhesives, stabilizers or any other additives containing any lead, cadmium, mercury or hexavalent chromium which has been intentionally introduced as a chemical element during manufacturing or distribution as opposed to the incidental presence of any of these elements. b.    On or after January 1, 1993, no person shall sell, offer for sale, or offer for promotional purposes in this State any product contained in a package which includes, in the package itself or in any packaging component, inks, dyes, pigments, adhesives, stabilizers or any other additives containing any lead, cadmium, mercury or hexavalent chromium which has been intentionally introduced as a chemical element during manufacturing or distribution as opposed to the incidental presence of any of these elements. c.     The sum of the concentration levels of lead, cadmium, mercury or hexavalent chromium present in any package or packaging component, which shall constitute an incidental presence, shall not exceed the following levels: (1)  Not more than 600 parts per million by weight (0.06 [%] percent) after January 1, 1993; (2)  Not more than 250 parts per million by weight (0.025 [%] percent) after January 1, 1994; (3)  Not more than 100 parts per million by weight (0.01 [%] percent) after January 1, 1995.
