If an owner seeking to be licensed is other than an individual, the application shall state the name of an individual who is a member, officer, or stockholder in the corporation or association seeking to be licensed, and the same shall be designated the primary owner of the rooming or boarding house.

STATEMENT The bill amends the "Rooming and Boarding House Act of 1979" to strengthen the States regulation of cooperative sober living residences, as defined in the bill. Specifically, the bill increases the maximum civil penalty for certain licensing violations for a rooming or boarding house, including cooperative sober living residences.  The bill requires the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) to maintain a list of licensed cooperative sober living residences on its Internet website including the location and contact information for each licensed cooperative sober living residence.  The bill requires two unannounced inspection and record reviews of cooperative sober living residences per year to determine whether the owner or operator of the cooperative sober living residence is complying with the provisions of the "Rooming and Boarding House Act of 1979."  The bill also establishes reporting requirements for incidents affecting the safety or welfare of cooperative sober living residence residents or staff, which includes an immediate notification to DCA and a written report of the incident within five working days of the incident.  Incidents for which the bills reporting requirements would apply include: (1)  fire, flood, disaster, accident, or other unanticipated event that results in the serious injury or death of a resident or staff member, or the evacuation of residents from the cooperative sober living residence, or closure of the cooperative sober living residence for six or more hours; (2)  serious injury or death of a resident of the cooperative sober living residence, including overdose; (3)  outbreak of a communicable disease or other condition that adversely affects multiple residents or staff; (4)  alleged or suspected crimes that endanger the life or safety of residents or staff, or which jeopardize the operations or fiscal stability of the cooperative sober living residence; (5)  disciplinary actions concerning staff, including termination, resulting from inappropriate staff interaction with residents; and (6)  criminal convictions or disciplinary sanctions imposed on staff or board members or representatives of the governing authority by licensing or credentialing boards since the prior application for licensure. Under the bill, the Commissioner of Community Affairs is, in consultation with the Commissioner of Health and the Commissioner of Human Services, to require cooperative sober living residences to: employ staff members, who are to be required to live in cooperative sober living residences and who are qualified to assist others to recover from alcohol and drug addiction in a manner to be determined by the commissioner; forbid possession or use of alcohol or illicit drugs within the residence and subject residents to random testing for alcohol and drug use; and provide residents individual counseling and group meetings sessions which are centered on recovery from alcohol and drug addiction.
