Under current law, there is no requirement that a Roth contribution option be made available to public employees who choose to participate in their respective deferred compensation retirement plan. Under current law, public employers may offer a deferred compensation plan to their employees.  Deferred compensation plans provide an opportunity to voluntarily shelter a portion of an employees salary from federal income taxes to save for retirement to supplement Social Security and any other retirement plan provided by public employers to their employees.
