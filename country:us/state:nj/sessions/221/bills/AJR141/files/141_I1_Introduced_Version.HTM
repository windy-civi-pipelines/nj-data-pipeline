STATEMENT This resolution designates October of each year as Walk to School Month. Walking and biking to school are beneficial for children, their families, their schools, and their communities. Walking and biking bring physical and health benefits to children and their families by providing regular exercise. This reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, making the whole family healthier. The more families who walk to school, the fewer vehicles there are on the road which reduces traffic and air pollution. The benefits also extend to the school and community with lower road maintenance costs. In order to fully realize the benefits of more children walking to school, communities and schools must do their part in planning safe routes for families to walk. This can mean placing or repairing sidewalks along busy roadways, introducing traffic calming measures near schools, or installing pedestrian signals at intersections. It is important that parents, school officials, and community leaders work together to ensure safe walking and biking routes to schools for families in their community. By recognizing Walk to School Month, the State encourages all schools and communities to promote the benefits of walking or biking to school.
