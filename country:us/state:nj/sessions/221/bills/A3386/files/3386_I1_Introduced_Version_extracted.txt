This bill would provide the opportunity for the governing body of a municipality to provide input to the State, or county, as applicable, on grant or loan applications for monies for the acquisition or development of lands for recreation and conservation purposes within that municipality.  The State, or county, as applicable, would then take this input into consideration when making a decision on the grant or loan application.
