INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This change to the State Constitution provides that the people of New Jersey have a State right to keep and bear firearms. The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution provides a federal right to keep and bear arms. The Supreme Court of the United States has interpreted this to mean that individuals have a right to own firearms. Currently, the State Constitution provides that the people of New Jersey have the right of enjoying and defending life and liberty, but does not explicitly include a right to firearm ownership. This amendment would make it clear that an individuals right to keep and bear arms is also protected by the State Constitution. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution proposes to amend the New Jersey Constitution to provide for a State right to keep and bear arms. The amendment provides that the right to keep and bear arms could not be infringed. The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution provides for a right to keep and bear arms. The Supreme Court of the United States has interpreted this to mean individuals have a right to own firearms. The court also has determined that the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution makes the right applicable to the states. Currently, the State Constitution provides that the people of New Jersey have the right of enjoying and defending life and liberty, but does not explicitly include a right to firearm ownership. The amendment proposed by this resolution would include the right to keep and bear firearms in the State Constitution.
