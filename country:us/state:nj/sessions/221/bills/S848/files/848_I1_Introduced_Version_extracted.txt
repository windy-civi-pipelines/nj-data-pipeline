STATEMENT This bill will make business administrators serving in local governments eligible for membership in the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS).  Since July 1, 2007, business administrators have been required to participate in the Defined Contribution Retirement Program (DCRP). The bill also provides for the transfer to the PERS of a business administrator who is participating in the DCRP as of the bills effective date.  A business administrator who transfers to the DCRP may elect to receive credit in the PERS for service as a business administrator during participation in the DCRP.  To receive full PERS credit for that service, the business administrator and the administrators employer will have to pay the contributions and costs required by the PERS for the benefits provided by the retirement system.  If the employer does not make the payment, the employee will have to make the employers payment. The bill also defines the term business administrator to include municipal or county administrators, municipal or county managers, city managers, town managers, village managers, borough managers, township managers, or any functional equivalent.
