These mobile surveillance towers will be utilized in New Jersey communities when the DSP is deployed to assist with crowd control. Mobile surveillance towers will provide the DSP with an unobstructed 360° degree view to provide maximum coverage during large scale events and unpermitted mass gatherings. On May 21, 2022 the municipality of Long Branch, New Jersey experienced an unpermitted mass gathering after a social media posting drew large crowds that authorities said threatened public safety. First responders reportedly included the Long Branch Police Department, Monmouth County Prosecutors Office, Monmouth County Emergency Response Team (MOCERT), Monmouth and Middlesex Rapid Deployment Forces (RDF), Monmouth County Sheriffs Office, New Jersey State Police, Department of Corrections, and NJ Transit Police.  Last summer, there were several similar situations of large-scale pop-up parties in the same area of the State. These unpermitted mass gatherings affect not only public safety when not patrolled effectively, but also affect the economic wellbeing of shore businesses who rely on visitors to the New Jersey shore during the summer season.
