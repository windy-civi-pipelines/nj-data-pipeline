These funds shall be available for the use of the municipality for the purpose of making the adaptable entrance of any such affordable unit accessible when requested to do so by a person with a disability who occupies or intends to occupy the unit and requires an accessible entrance. For the purposes of this section: Adaptable, as used with regard to an entrance, means that the plans for the unit include a feasible building plan to adapt the entrance so as to make the unit accessible. Disabled person means disabled person as defined in section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304). Ground floor means the first floor with a dwelling unit or portion of a dwelling unit, regardless of whether that floor is at grade.  A building may have more than one ground floor. Site impracticable means having the characteristic of site impracticability as set forth in section 100.205 (a) of title 24, Code of Federal Regulations. Sweat equity means the provision of labor, the requisite hours of which shall be determined by a sweat equity certified nonprofit, spent in construction or rehabilitation of a low- or moderate-income dwelling unit by one or more members of the low- or moderate-income household who is intended to occupy the dwelling unit. Sweat equity certified nonprofit means a corporation with experience in facilitating the construction or rehabilitation, or both, of dwelling units, in part through the provision of sweat equity, that is organized pursuant to the New Jersey Nonprofit Corporation Act, N.J.S.15A:1-1 et seq., or is a corporation organized pursuant to Title 16 of the Revised Statutes, and that is certified by the Commissioner of Community Affairs pursuant to subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2005, c.350, s.5) 5.  On or before the first day of the fourth month next following enactment of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the Commissioner of Community Affairs shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations to necessary for the implementation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 6.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, except that the Commissioner of Community Affairs shall take such anticipatory action as is necessary in order to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). STATEMENT This bill would facilitate the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing that is built in part through sweat equity by the eventual occupant.  Sweat equity refers to the provision of labor spent in construction or rehabilitation of a low- or moderate-income dwelling unit by one or more members of the low- or moderate-income household intended to occupy the unit. The bill directs the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) to establish an application process, and approve appropriate applicants as sweat equity certified nonprofits. The bill directs the commissioner to approve a certification application if the applicant: · possesses appropriate experience in facilitating the construction or rehabilitation of dwelling units, in part through sweat equity; · maintains appropriate controls on the affordability of dwelling units produced, in part through sweat equity, for low- or moderate-income households, to ensure that the units remain affordable for a reasonable period of time; · maintains a policy of promoting the opportunities that the organization offers in the production of housing through sweat equity to a diverse cross-section of the public; and · is organized under the New Jersey Nonprofit Corporation Act, N.J.S.15A:1-1 et seq., or as a religious organization under Title 16 of the Revised Statutes. If sweat equity is used in producing an affordable dwelling unit, and the units production is facilitated by a sweat equity certified nonprofit, then the bill directs that the adaptability requirements, which ordinarily apply to affordable housing construction, would not apply.  The adaptability requirements concern compliance with the technical design standards of the barrier free subcode of the State Uniform Construction Code.  Additionally, for sweat equity produced units facilitated by a sweat equity certified nonprofit, the bill would: · provide the units with an exemption from the ordinary affirmative marketing requirements of the Fair Housing Act, P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.); and · allow the controls on affordability maintained by the sweat equity certified nonprofit to be substituted for the equivalent requirements of the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls. The bill requires the commissioner to direct the appropriate offices or divisions of the Department of Community Affairs, to provide expedited assistance to sweat equity certified nonprofits and municipalities in: · ensuring that units, for which sweat equity is used in construction or rehabilitation, are counted towards the fair share affordable housing obligation of the municipality; · facilitating the transfer of abandoned property in the municipality, as appropriate for the production of affordable housing, to the sweat equity certified nonprofit through necessary processes, including but not limited to the process for individual abandoned property takings pursuant to section 37 of the New Jersey Urban Redevelopment Act, P.L.1996, c.62 (C.55:19-56); and · facilitating use of the municipal affordable housing trust fund, and the New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund, for the production of units for which sweat equity is used in the construction or rehabilitation. The bill directs the commissioner, by the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, to adopt the rules and regulations necessary for the implementation of the bill. The bill would take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment.

(3)  Pursuant to section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), compliance with the requirements of this section shall not be required where sweat equity is used in the construction or rehabilitation of a low- or moderate-income dwelling unit, and the construction or rehabilitation of the unit is facilitated by a nonprofit entity that is approved as a sweat equity certified nonprofit pursuant to subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.    , c.

Additionally, the builder of the unit or units shall deposit sufficient funds to adapt 10 percent of the affordable units in the project which have not been constructed with accessible entrances with the municipality in which the units are located, for deposit into the municipal affordable housing trust fund. These funds shall be available for the use of the municipality for the purpose of making the adaptable entrance of any such affordable unit accessible when requested to do so by a person with a disability who occupies or intends to occupy the unit and requires an accessible entrance. For the purposes of this section: Adaptable, as used with regard to an entrance, means that the plans for the unit include a feasible building plan to adapt the entrance so as to make the unit accessible. Disabled person means disabled person as defined in section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304). Ground floor means the first floor with a dwelling unit or portion of a dwelling unit, regardless of whether that floor is at grade.  A building may have more than one ground floor. Site impracticable means having the characteristic of site impracticability as set forth in section 100.205 (a) of title 24, Code of Federal Regulations. Sweat equity means the provision of labor, the requisite hours of which shall be determined by a sweat equity certified nonprofit, spent in construction or rehabilitation of a low- or moderate-income dwelling unit by one or more members of the low- or moderate-income household who is intended to occupy the dwelling unit. Sweat equity certified nonprofit means a corporation with experience in facilitating the construction or rehabilitation, or both, of dwelling units, in part through the provision of sweat equity, that is organized pursuant to the New Jersey Nonprofit Corporation Act, N.J.S.15A:1-1 et seq., or is a corporation organized pursuant to Title 16 of the Revised Statutes, and that is certified by the Commissioner of Community Affairs pursuant to subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2005, c.350, s.5) 5.  On or before the first day of the fourth month next following enactment of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the Commissioner of Community Affairs shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations to necessary for the implementation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 6.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, except that the Commissioner of Community Affairs shall take such anticipatory action as is necessary in order to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). STATEMENT This bill would facilitate the construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing that is built in part through sweat equity by the eventual occupant.  Sweat equity refers to the provision of labor spent in construction or rehabilitation of a low- or moderate-income dwelling unit by one or more members of the low- or moderate-income household intended to occupy the unit. The bill directs the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) to establish an application process, and approve appropriate applicants as sweat equity certified nonprofits. The bill directs the commissioner to approve a certification application if the applicant: · possesses appropriate experience in facilitating the construction or rehabilitation of dwelling units, in part through sweat equity; · maintains appropriate controls on the affordability of dwelling units produced, in part through sweat equity, for low- or moderate-income households, to ensure that the units remain affordable for a reasonable period of time; · maintains a policy of promoting the opportunities that the organization offers in the production of housing through sweat equity to a diverse cross-section of the public; and · is organized under the New Jersey Nonprofit Corporation Act, N.J.S.15A:1-1 et seq., or as a religious organization under Title 16 of the Revised Statutes. If sweat equity is used in producing an affordable dwelling unit, and the units production is facilitated by a sweat equity certified nonprofit, then the bill directs that the adaptability requirements, which ordinarily apply to affordable housing construction, would not apply.  The adaptability requirements concern compliance with the technical design standards of the barrier free subcode of the State Uniform Construction Code.  Additionally, for sweat equity produced units facilitated by a sweat equity certified nonprofit, the bill would: · provide the units with an exemption from the ordinary affirmative marketing requirements of the Fair Housing Act, P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.); and · allow the controls on affordability maintained by the sweat equity certified nonprofit to be substituted for the equivalent requirements of the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls. The bill requires the commissioner to direct the appropriate offices or divisions of the Department of Community Affairs, to provide expedited assistance to sweat equity certified nonprofits and municipalities in: · ensuring that units, for which sweat equity is used in construction or rehabilitation, are counted towards the fair share affordable housing obligation of the municipality; · facilitating the transfer of abandoned property in the municipality, as appropriate for the production of affordable housing, to the sweat equity certified nonprofit through necessary processes, including but not limited to the process for individual abandoned property takings pursuant to section 37 of the New Jersey Urban Redevelopment Act, P.L.1996, c.62 (C.55:19-56); and · facilitating use of the municipal affordable housing trust fund, and the New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund, for the production of units for which sweat equity is used in the construction or rehabilitation. The bill directs the commissioner, by the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, to adopt the rules and regulations necessary for the implementation of the bill. The bill would take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment.
