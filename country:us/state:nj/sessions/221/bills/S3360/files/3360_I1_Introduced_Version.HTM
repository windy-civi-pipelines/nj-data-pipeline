An Act permitting public employees a leave of absence without pay to assist the military or civilian government in Israel during the Hamas War and supplementing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  A leave of absence without pay shall be given to officers and employees of the State and a political subdivision of the State, or an agency, authority, or instrumentality thereof, that has adopted the provisions of Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes for travel to Israel to assist the military or civilian government during the Hamas War.  The leave of absence shall be for a period inclusive of the duration of the Hamas War with a reasonable time allowed for travel.  Prior to the approval of the leave of absence, the officer or employee shall submit documentation from an authorized representative of the Israeli defense forces or Israeli government to the employer. Upon the expiration of the leave, the officer or employee shall have the right to return to the former title and receive all of the rights, privileges, and benefits of that title as if the officer or employee had remained in that title. 2.  A leave of absence without pay shall be given to officers and employees of a local school district as defined in section 3 of P.L.1991, c.393 (C.18A:12-23) for travel to Israel to assist the military or civilian government during the Hamas War.  The leave of absence shall be for a period inclusive of the duration of the Hamas War with a reasonable time allowed for travel.  Prior to the approval of the leave of absence, the officer or employee shall submit documentation from an authorized representative of the Israeli defense forces or Israeli government to the employer. Upon the expiration of the leave, the officer or employee shall have the right to return to the former title and receive all of the rights, privileges, and benefits of that title as if the officer or employee had remained in that title. 3.  A leave of absence without pay shall be given to officers and employees of a political subdivision of the State, or an agency, authority, or instrumentality thereof, that has not adopted the provisions of Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes for travel to Israel to assist the military or civilian government during the Hamas War.  The leave of absence shall be for a period inclusive of the duration of the Hamas War with a reasonable time allowed for travel.  Prior to the approval of the leave of absence, the officer or employee shall submit documentation from an authorized representative of the Israeli defense forces or Israeli government to the employer. Upon the expiration of the leave, the officer or employee shall have the right to return to the former title and receive all of the rights, privileges, and benefits of that title as if the officer or employee had remained in that title. 4.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill permits public employees a leave of absence without pay to assist the military or civilian government in Israel during the Hamas War.  Such leave is contingent upon the employers approval of the employees documentation from an authorized representative of the Israeli defense forces or Israeli government.  Upon the expiration of the leave, the employee will have the right to return to the former title and receive all of the rights, privileges, and benefits of that title as if the employee had remained in that title. This bill is necessitated by the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by the terror group Hamas, which killed over 1,100 Israelis and foreign nationals and took over 200 hostages.  To many in the United States, this horrific event was reminiscent of the 9/11 attack that killed many New Jersey residents. Since then, many Americans have left their family, friends, and jobs behind to volunteer in the defense of the State of Israel.  This spirit of volunteerism is commended and should be supported. This legislation is a step in that support.
