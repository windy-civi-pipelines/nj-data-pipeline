Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that a workers ability to freely change jobs is critical to the
workers economic liberty as well as to creating a thriving and innovative
economy.  Additionally, a tenet of worker protection and empowerment is that
the cost of training required by an employer to perform a job should be imposed
on employers, as it is employers who ultimately stand to financially benefit
from a well-trained workforce.  Employment provisions that have the effect of
binding workers in low-wage jobs or jobs with poor working conditions, or of
indebting workers to their former employers upon separation for the cost of
training, have the effect of reducing those workers professional mobility,
creating obstacles toward financial security and chilling the State economy.  It
is therefore in the interest of individual workers and of the State to protect workers
from non-compete clauses, employment-based debts, no-poach agreements, and
other restraints on worker mobility, and to assist in aligning the costs of
operating a business with its financial benefits by preventing employers, after
the conclusion of employment, from shifting expenses of any training they
require for workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in the act:</p>

employee to pay an employer, or the employers agent or assignee, a sum of

which states that the payment constitutes reimbursement for training provided
to the employee by the employer or by a third party. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Employment-related cost
means a necessary expenditure or loss incurred by an employee in direct
consequence of the discharge of their duties at work or of their obedience to a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Non-compete clause means any

or an entity, including, but not limited to, a corporation, partnership,

wage, benefit and tax laws has the same meaning as provided in section 1 of
P.L.2009, c.194 (C.34:1A-1.11).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a. Any non-compete
clause by which any employee is restrained from engaging in a lawful
profession, trade, or business of any kind after the conclusion of the
employees employment with the employer, is against public policy, void and
unenforceable, including any clause or agreement which was entered into or in
effect on or before the effective date of this act.</p>

employer to enter into, attempt to enter into, present to an employee, past
employee, or prospective employee as a term of employment, or attempt to

restrains an employee from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business
