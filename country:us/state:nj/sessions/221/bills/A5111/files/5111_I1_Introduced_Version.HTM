The participation in one agreement shall not bar participation with the same or other parties in any other agreement. f.     Payment for services performed pursuant to an agreement shall be made by and to the parties, and at such intervals, as shall be provided in the agreement. g.    In the event of any dispute as to the amount to be paid, the full amount to be paid as provided in subsection a. of this section shall be paid; but if through subsequent negotiation, arbitration or litigation the amount due shall be determined, agreed or adjudicated to be less than was actually so paid, then the party having received the payment shall forthwith repay the excess. (cf: P.L.2013, c.166, s.6) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the "Uniform Shared Services and Consolidation Act," P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A:65-1 through C.40A:65-35) to allow local units entering into or renewing a shared services agreement for the development of a warehouse within their shared territories, pursuant to law, to specify terms and conditions related to sharing the costs and revenues of the warehouse development.  The bill also requires that the agreement include information on the square footage of the warehouse. It is the sponsors intent to give municipalities another tool to prevent the overdevelopment or underutilization of warehouses. Some municipalities are promised increased property tax revenue from warehouse developments, only to find that the pledge leaves them with many empty or under-used facilities and less property taxes than promised.
