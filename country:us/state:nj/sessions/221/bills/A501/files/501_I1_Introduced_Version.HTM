<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    (a)  Every sewerage
authority is hereby authorized to charge and collect rents, rates, fees or
other charges (in <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>this
act<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>P.L.1946,
c.138 (C.40:14A-1 et seq.),</u> sometimes referred to as &quot;service
charges&quot;) for direct or indirect connection with, or the use or services
of, the sewerage system.  Such service charges may be charged to and collected
from any person contracting for such connection or use or services or from the
owner or occupant, or both of them, of any real property which directly or
indirectly is or has been connected with the system or from or on which
originates or has originated sewage or other wastes which directly or
indirectly have entered or may enter the sewerage system, and the owner of any
such real property shall be liable for and shall pay such service charges to
the sewerage authority at the time when and the place where such service
charges are due and payable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Rents, rates, fees and
charges <u>for commercial use of sewerage services</u>, which may be payable
periodically, being in the nature of use or service charges, shall as nearly as
the sewerage authority shall deem practicable and equitable be uniform
throughout the district for the same type, class and amount of use or service
of the sewerage system <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>,
except as permitted by section 1 of P.L.1994, c.78 (C.40:14A-8.2),<b><span

otherwise connected or identified with the real property, or on the capacity of
the improvements on or connected with the real property, or on any other
factors determining the type, class and amount of use or service of the
sewerage system, or on any combination of any such factors, and may give weight
to the characteristics of the sewage and other wastes and any other special
matter affecting the cost of treatment and disposal thereof, including chlorine
demand, biochemical oxygen demand, concentration of solids and chemical
composition.  <u>Rents, rates, fees, and charges for residential use of
sewerage services shall be</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u>uniform throughout the district
for the same type, class, and amount of use or service of the sewerage system,
except as permitted by section 1 of P.L.1994, c.78 (C.40:14A-8.2), and shall be
based or computed on the metered consumption of water on or in connection with
the real property; provided, however, that a residential customer with a separate
account for outdoor water or sewerage services shall not be charged sewerage
disposal fees for water obtained from an outdoor source or recorded by a meter
dedicated to the outdoor account.  A sewerage authority may establish a tiered
system of rates, through which the authority may charge residential customers
different rates based upon the total metered units of water consumed on or in
connection with the real property in a billing cycle.</u>  In addition to any
such periodic service charges, a separate charge in the nature of a connection
fee or tapping fee, in respect of each connection of any property with the
sewerage system, may be imposed upon the owner or occupant of the property so
connected.  Such connection charges shall be uniform within each class of
users, except as provided by section 2 of P.L.2005, c.29 (C.40:14A-8.30) and
except as provided by section 2 of P.L.2005, c.173 (C.40:14A-8.4), and the
amount thereof shall not exceed the actual cost of the physical connection, if
made by the authority, plus an amount computed in the following manner to
represent a fair payment toward the cost of the system:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The amount representing
all debt service, including but not limited to sinking funds, reserve funds,
the principal and interest on bonds, and the amount of any loans and interest
thereon, paid by the sewerage authority to defray the capital cost of
developing the system as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year of
the authority shall be added to all capital expenditures made by the authority
not funded by a bond ordinance or debt for the development of the system as of
the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year of the authority.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Any gifts, contributions
or subsidies to the authority received from, and not reimbursed or reimbursable
to any federal, State, county or municipal government or agency or any private
person, and that portion of amounts paid to the authority by a public entity
under a service agreement or service contract which is not repaid to the public
entity by the authority, shall then be subtracted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The remainder shall be
divided by the total number of service units served by the authority at the end
of the immediately preceding fiscal year of the authority, and the results
shall then be apportioned to each new connector according to the number of
service units attributed to that connector, to produce the connector's
contribution to the cost of the system.  In attributing service units to each

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires local
public authorities that charge for water and sewer services to base residential
customers' bills exclusively upon metered consumption.  Under current law,
local public authorities providing water and sewer services may establish
charges for those services based on any number of factors, including
consumption, the number and type of water outlets, the number and type of
plumbing fixtures or facilities, the number of persons residing on the
property, the capacity of fixtures, or any other factors determining the type,
class, and amount of water or sewer use.  In addition, this bill permits local
public authorities and local units to establish a tiered system of rates,
through which a local unit may charge different rates based upon the total
metered units of water consumed on or in connection with the real property in a
billing cycle.  The bill exempts residential customers with separate outdoor
water or sewer accounts from charges for sewer disposal services recorded by
meters tied to the outdoor account or that resulted from the disposal of water
obtained from an outdoor source.  Essentially, a resident with a separate
outdoor account is not to be responsible for sewer service charges related to
the resident's use of water from an outdoor source.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill takes effect
immediately, except with respect to local public authorities and local units
that do not have meters installed on the effective date of this bill.  For
those entities, the provisions of the bill are to become operative as soon as
technically feasible, but not later than the first day of the fourth year next
following enactment.</p>
