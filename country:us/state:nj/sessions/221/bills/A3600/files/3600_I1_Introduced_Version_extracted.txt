The bill also amends section 50 of P.L.1999, c.53 (C.30:4C-61.2) to require that a permanency hearing providing for court review and approval of a placement plan be held no later than six months after a child has been in placement.  Current law requires that this hearing be held no later than 12 months after the child has been in placement.
