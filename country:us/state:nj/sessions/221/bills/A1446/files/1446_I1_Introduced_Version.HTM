The bills revisions include various amendments to delete references to athlete, thereby acknowledging the fact that athletic trainers provide services to persons generally, rather than athletes specifically. The bill requires athletic trainers to display, or carry on the athletic trainers person if displaying is not possible, a practicing license at any place the athletic trainer renders services. The bill also modifies the curriculum requirements for the board to approve to include, among other items, a degree in professional athletic training from a postsecondary educational institution that meets the academic standards of the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education.  Additionally, references to the Board of Certification, Inc. are incorporated into current law, including to replace references to the National Athletic Trainers' Association Board of Certification, Inc.
