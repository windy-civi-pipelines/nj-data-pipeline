Specifically, the bill increases the maximum size of tax credits awarded under
the program and allows for certain facade rehabilitation projects to be
eligible for a tax credit award.</p>

awarded for the rehabilitation of a qualified property located in a qualified

rehabilitation, up to a maximum of $4 million.  The bill defines facade
rehabilitation projects to mean a project consisting of the repair or
reconstruction of exterior building features, including but not limited to
structural components embedded within exterior walls, masonry units and mortar,
exterior siding fabric, doors, windows, exterior lighting fixtures, and
