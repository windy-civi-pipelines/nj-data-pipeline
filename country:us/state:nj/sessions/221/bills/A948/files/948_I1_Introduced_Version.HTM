<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of this bill is to
eliminate the eligibility for enrollment in any State-administered retirement
system, such as the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), for newly hired
officers and employees, and for the continued enrollment of those who have less
than 10 years of service credit in the retirement system, of the New Jersey
State League of Municipalities (N.J.S.A.40:48-22), the New Jersey Association
of Counties, the New Jersey School Boards Association (N.J.S.A.18A:6-48), any
school board insurance group (N.J.S.A.18A:18B-3), any county college joint
insurance group (N.J.S.A.18A:64A-25.35), any county or municipal joint
insurance fund (N.J.S.A.40A:10-38), and any corporation designated to manage a
special improvement district established by municipal ordinance
(N.J.S.A.40:56-68).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Officers or employees who are
enrolled in a retirement system before the bills effective date, have 10 or
more years of service credit in the retirement system on that effective date,
and who continue to serve that particular organization, association, group,
fund or corporation without a break would not be affected by the bill.  As a
result of this bill, the entities noted above will not be considered public
agencies with regard to their new officers and employees and current officers
and employees with less than 10 years of pension service credit and, thus,
these officers and employees will no longer be eligible for health care
coverage under the State Health Benefits Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill amends the
PERS law (N.J.S.A.43:15A-7) to prohibit any officer or employee of a nonprofit
organization that is an educational foundation, or substantially similar
entity, created by or on behalf of an institution of higher education in this
State for the purpose of receiving donations from becoming a member of the PERS
on the basis of that employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill repeals
two sections of law that permit members of the Teachers Pension and Annuity
Fund and the Public Employees Retirement System to continue to make
contributions for service credit while on an approved leave of absence as an
officer or representative of a local, county, or State labor organization which
represents, or is affiliated with an organization which represents, public
employees.  The contributions are based upon the compensation that would have
been received by the member under the negotiated salary guide of the employer
granting the leave had that member remained in service with that employer,
including applicable normal increments and negotiated wage increases occurring
during the period of the leave.  The TPAF law was enacted in 1989; the PERS law
was enacted in 2005.</p>
