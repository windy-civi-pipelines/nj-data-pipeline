(cf: P.L.1977, c.239, s.15) 17.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill expands the scope of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman (ombudsman) to provide that the office of the ombudsman will oversee all long-term care facility residents, not just the elderly.  The bill updates certain statutory references to reflect this change, and additionally removes references to patients and clients of a facility. Current law provides that, upon completing an investigation, the ombudsmans findings and recommended action are to be submitted to the Commissioner of Health or the Commissioner of Human Services, as appropriate, as well as to any other governmental agency that regulates or operates the facility.  The bill revises this requirement to provide that the report be furnished to these entities upon request, and upon substantiation of the report or complaint.  The bill further provides that the report may also be provided to the complainant, if the resident or the residents legal representative consents to the complainant receiving a copy of the report.  The bill provides that, in addition to obtaining the name and address of a person on a consent form, the ombudsman is to make reasonable efforts to obtain the persons phone number and email address. The bill removes a requirement for the ombudsman to provide notice before inspecting the premises, books, files, medical records, or other records of a facility or government agency during the course of an investigation. The bill revises a requirement for the Legislature to review the development, administration, and operation of the office through certain standing reference committees to instead make the Legislature directly responsible for the review. The bill makes various technical and stylistic changes to the current statutory law involving grammar and citation.

(cf: P.L.1977, c.239, s.9) 12.  Section 10 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-10) is amended to read as follow: 10. a.  The office shall promote community contact and involvement with [patients, residents and clients] long-term care residents [of facilities] through the use of volunteers and volunteer programs.  The volunteers, as private citizens, may exercise, but need not be limited to, such functions as visitation, consultation, problem solving, eliciting complaints[,] and generally serving as advocates on behalf of [the institutionalized elderly] long-term care residents.

In implementing the provisions of this section the ombudsman shall coordinate the efforts of the office concerning volunteers and councils with all relevant government agencies, and with the administrators of such private facilities as [he] the ombudsman may deem appropriate, to [insure] ensure coordination and avoid duplication of effort, so that the volunteer programs and councils developed and supported by the office may genuinely serve the interests of [the institutionalized elderly] long-term care residents without in any way disrupting the legitimate functioning of any facility in this State. (cf: P.L.1977, c.239, s.10) 13.  Section 11 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-11) is amended to read as follows: 11.  a.  Any correspondence or written communication from any [patient, resident, or client] long-term care resident [of a facility] to the office shall, if delivered to or received by the facility, be promptly forwarded, unopened, by the facility to the office.  Any correspondence or written communication from the office to any [patient, resident, or client] long-term care resident [of a facility] shall, if delivered to or received by the facility, be promptly forwarded, unopened, by the facility to such [patient, resident, or client] long-term care resident. b.    The office shall prepare and distribute to each facility written notices, in English and Spanish, which set forth the address and telephone number of the office, a brief explanation of the function of the office, the procedure to follow in filing a complaint, and other pertinent information.  The notice shall also indicate the option to call 9-1-1. The administrator of each facility shall ensure that such written notice is given to every [patient, resident, or client] long-term care resident or the [patient's,] resident's[, or client's] guardian upon admission to the facility and to every person already in residence or the person's guardian.  The administrator shall also post such written notice in a conspicuous, public place in the facility in the number and manner set forth in the guidelines adopted by the office. c.     The facility shall inform [patients, residents, or clients,] long-term care residents and their guardians, resident representatives, or families, of their rights and entitlements under State and federal laws and rules and regulations in a format and language that the recipient understands, by means of the distribution of educational materials as provided in subsection b. of this section. d.    The office shall facilitate the filing of complaints with the office concerning matters within the authority of the office.  The measures taken in connection therewith shall include, but need not be limited to, maintenance of a toll-free telephone, either by the office or in conjunction with another appropriate State agency, at least during regular working hours of the office for the filing of complaints. e.     The administrator of each facility shall annually provide all caretakers, social workers, physicians, registered or licensed practical nurses, and other professionals and staff members employed at the facility with a notice explaining the requirements of section 2 of P.L.1983, c.43 (C.52:27G-7.1) concerning the reporting of suspected abuse or exploitation of [an institutionalized elderly person] a long-term care resident, and require, as a condition of employment at the facility, that the employee acknowledge in writing receipt of the notice.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.186, s.3) 14.  Section 13 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-13) is amended to read as follows: 13.  a.  The office shall maintain confidentiality with respect to all matters in relation to any complaint or investigation together with identities of the complainants, witnesses, or [patients,] long-term care residents [or clients] involved, unless such  persons authorize, in writing, the release of such information, except for such disclosures as may be necessary to enable the office to perform its duties and to support any opinions or recommendations that may result from a complaint or investigation.  The investigatory files of the office, including all complaints and responses of the office to complaints, shall be maintained as confidential information.  Release of pertinent records shall be at the discretion of the ombudsman.  Nothing herein contained shall preclude the use by the office of material in its files, otherwise confidential, for the preparation and disclosure of statistical, case study, and other pertinent data, provided that in any such use there shall be no disclosure of the identity or the means for discovering the identity of particular persons. b.    Any person conducting or participating in any examination of a complaint or an investigation who shall disclose to any person other than the office, or those authorized by the ombudsman to receive it, the name of any witness examined, or any information obtained or given upon such examination or investigation, is a disorderly person. c.     Any statement or communication made by the office relevant to a complaint received by, proceedings before, or investigative activities of, the office, and any complaint or information made or provided in good faith by any person, shall be absolutely privileged and such privilege shall be a complete defense in any action which shall allege libel or slander. d.    The office shall not be required to testify in any court with respect to matters held to be confidential in this section except as the court may deem necessary to enforce the provisions of this act. (cf: P.L.1977, c.239, s.13) 15.  Section 14 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-14) is amended to read as follows: 14.  a.  No discriminatory, disciplinary, or retaliatory action shall be taken against any officer or employee of a facility or government agency by such facility or government agency or against any [patient,] long-term care resident[, or client of a facility] or guardian or family member thereof, or volunteer, for any communication by [him] that individual with the office or for any information given or disclosed by [him] the individual in good faith to aid the office in carrying out its duties and responsibilities.  Any person who knowingly or willfully violates the provisions of this subsection by instituting discriminatory, disciplinary, or retaliatory action against any officer or employee of a facility or government agency or against any [patient,] long-term care resident [or client of a facility] or guardian or family member thereof, or volunteer, for any communication by [him] that individual with the office or for any information given or disclosed by [him] the individual in good faith to aid the office in carrying out its duties and responsibilities, is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. b.    Any person who willfully hinders the lawful actions of the office or willfully refuses to comply with its lawful demands, including the demand of immediate entry into and inspection of a facility or government agency or the demand of immediate access to a [patient,] long-term care resident [or client] thereof, or who offers any compensation, gratuity, or promise thereof to the office in an effort to affect the outcome of any matter which is being investigated, or is likely to be investigated, shall be subject to a penalty of not more than [$5,000.00] $5,000.

(cf: P.L.1987, c.104, s.1) 16.  Section of 15 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-15) is amended to read as follows: 15.  The Legislature [through the Senate and Assembly Standing Committees on Institutions, Health and Welfare, or such other committee or committees as may be designated from time to time by the President of the Senate and Speaker of the General Assembly, respectively] shall review, on a continuous basis, the development, administration, and operation of the office provided for in this act.  To facilitate this review and oversight, the office shall submit to the [committees] Legislature the reports required by this act [, and such other reports as shall be called for by the committees from time to time] in a manner that is consistent with section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1). (cf: P.L.1977, c.239, s.15) 17.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill expands the scope of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman (ombudsman) to provide that the office of the ombudsman will oversee all long-term care facility residents, not just the elderly.  The bill updates certain statutory references to reflect this change, and additionally removes references to patients and clients of a facility. Current law provides that, upon completing an investigation, the ombudsmans findings and recommended action are to be submitted to the Commissioner of Health or the Commissioner of Human Services, as appropriate, as well as to any other governmental agency that regulates or operates the facility.  The bill revises this requirement to provide that the report be furnished to these entities upon request, and upon substantiation of the report or complaint.  The bill further provides that the report may also be provided to the complainant, if the resident or the residents legal representative consents to the complainant receiving a copy of the report.  The bill provides that, in addition to obtaining the name and address of a person on a consent form, the ombudsman is to make reasonable efforts to obtain the persons phone number and email address. The bill removes a requirement for the ombudsman to provide notice before inspecting the premises, books, files, medical records, or other records of a facility or government agency during the course of an investigation. The bill revises a requirement for the Legislature to review the development, administration, and operation of the office through certain standing reference committees to instead make the Legislature directly responsible for the review. The bill makes various technical and stylistic changes to the current statutory law involving grammar and citation.
