amending and supplementing P.L.2013, c.15.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 4 of P.L.2013,
c.15 (C.54:1-104) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.     There is
established a real property assessment demonstration program, which shall be
open for participation therein to any county in the State, to evaluate the
efficacy and functionality of a municipal system of real property assessment
directed by a county tax board through the county tax administrator pursuant to
a revised assessment, and assessment appeal, calendar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A goal of the demonstration
program is to demonstrate an enhanced system of municipal real property
assessment as a complement to the county-based real property assessment system
pilot program undertaken pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2009, c.118 (C.54:1-86
et seq.), under which the entire real property assessment function formerly
performed by the municipal tax assessor, has been transferred to the county
through the appointment of a county assessor and deputy county assessors.  The
existence of two programs under which the real property assessment function is
performed using two different methods will allow the Legislature to evaluate
the effectiveness of each system of real property assessment, and to determine
whether the current statutory system of real property assessment function
should be revised Statewide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the first two full tax
years immediately following the enactment of P.L.2013, c.15 (C.54:1-101 et
al.), no more than two counties shall participate in the demonstration program
established in this section, and for the third and fourth full tax years
immediately following the enactment of P.L.2013, c.15 (C.54:1-101 et al.), no
more than two additional counties shall participate in the demonstration
program established in this section.  A county shall not institute a
demonstration program pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2013, c.15 (C.54:1-101
et al.) unless it meets the following criteria, and provides the required
information to the Director of the Division of Taxation and to the Director of
the Division of Local Government Services:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    the county tax board by
resolution, shall certify to the Director of the Division of Taxation and to
the Director of the Division of Local Government Services that the county tax
board has sufficient funds available to pay all of the costs associated with
the demonstration program, including the conversion to the MOD-IV system and
the associated expansion of the technology infrastructure to the municipalities
in the county.  The county tax board shall forward the resolution to the
Director of the Division of Taxation and to the Director of the Division of
Local Government Services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   the county is a
State-certified MOD-IV vendor, or the county has contracted with
a single State-certified MOD-IV vendor to provide MOD-IV technology to all of
the municipalities in the county. The county shall provide a copy of its MOD-IV
certification, or a copy of a valid contract for MOD-IV services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii)  the members of the
county's assessors' association, by not less than 2/3rds of its voting
membership, have approved the implementation of the demonstration program.  The
county tax board shall forward the resolution to the Director of the Division
of Taxation and to the Director of the Division of Local Government Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    There shall be no direct
appropriation of State funds used to effectuate the provisions of the
demonstration program established in subsection a. of this section.  The
technical costs of the demonstration program shall be paid by the county board
of taxation using assessment appeal filing fees collected by the county board
of taxation pursuant to section 18 of P.L.1979, c.499 (C.54:3-21.3a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)     Not later than
September 1 immediately preceding demonstration program implementation, and
using its own funds therefor, the county tax board of each demonstration county
participating in the demonstration program established in subsection a. of this
section shall provide MOD-IV and CAMA software to each municipality that does
not use the software, at no cost to those municipalities, and shall provide, at
no cost to those municipalities, training in the use of the software to the
assessors of those municipalities, and to their respective staff members. 
Thereafter, each municipality shall pay an annual fee per each taxable line
item in the municipality to the county tax board for the MOD-IV and CAMA
service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   On October 1 next
following the provision of software under paragraph (1) of this subsection,
each demonstration county shall commence the demonstration program under a plan
developed by the county tax administrator of each demonstration county,
approved by the county board of taxation, and submitted to the Director of the
Division of Taxation and the Director of the Division of Local Government Services
not less than 60 days prior to October 1.  The Director of the Division of
Taxation and the Director of the Division of Local Government Services shall
not propose or require any changes to a demonstration program plan submitted by
a county board of taxation unless a provision of the demonstration program
shall be inconsistent with State law, or the decision of any court of this
State, regarding the assessment of real property unless the changes have been
agreed to by a majority of the members of a demonstration county's Assessment
Demonstration Program Steering Committee created pursuant to paragraph (3) of
this subsection.  The demonstration program of each demonstration county shall
operate under all statutory requirements and pursuant to all statutory dates
and time frames concerning the assessment of real property in the State, as
those statutory dates and time frames have been amended pursuant to the
provisions of P.L.2013, c.15 (C.54:1-101 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Each demonstration
county shall establish an &quot;Assessment Demonstration Program Steering
Committee&quot; to monitor and report on the activities within the
demonstration county relative to the demonstration program.  Members of the
steering committee shall be the State Treasurer or his designee, the Director
of the Division of Taxation or his designee, the Director of the Division of
Local Government Services or his designee, a member of the County
 Assessor's Association of the demonstration county, and the county tax
administrator of the demonstration county.  Actions taken by the steering
committee shall be approved by a majority of the members of the steering
committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Director of the
Division of Taxation and the Director of the Division of Local Government
Services shall, with the advice and the recommendations of the county tax

July 1 next following the fourth full tax year after the implementation of the
demonstration program, a report detailing the experience of each demonstration
county participating in the demonstration program, the successes of the
program, any problems experienced under the program, and any recommendations
for statutory or administrative changes to the current system of real property
assessment in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Under the demonstration
program, each municipal assessor in a demonstration county shall utilize the
same property assessment software as is used by the county tax board and
provided to the municipalities by the county tax board pursuant to subsection
c. of this section.  All real property assessment functions required pursuant
to State law, including the revaluation or reassessment of real property, as
well as other assessment-based functions such as the development of a
compliance plan, maintenance of assessments and the calculation of added
assessments shall be performed using the property assessment software.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     In accordance with
the provisions of statutory law and with any rule or regulation promulgated
pursuant thereto, the county board of taxation of a demonstration county shall
compel the implementation of a revaluation or reassessment of real property in
any municipality in the demonstration county at such time that the county board
of taxation determines the need therefor. If a municipality fails to comply with
a revaluation or reassessment, as appropriate, ordered by the county board of
taxation in a timely manner, the county board of taxation shall cause the
revaluation or reassessment, as appropriate, to be performed at the
municipality's cost.  The cost of a revaluation or reassessment, as
appropriate, shall be directly billed to such a municipality, in addition to
the apportionment valuation, through the adjustment of the county levy for that
municipality pursuant to R.S.54:4-48 and R.S.54:4-49.  A municipality feeling
aggrieved by a decision of the county board of taxation to cause the
revaluation or reassessment, as appropriate, to be performed at the
municipality's cost may file an appeal of that decision of the county board of
taxation to the Tax Court within 45 days of the approval by the Director of the
Division of Taxation of the county tax board's order requiring the revaluation
or reassessment, as appropriate.</p>
