A taxpayer's net gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a share of an S corporation shall be calculated by increasing the adjusted basis of the share by an amount equal to the shareholder's net losses and deductions in respect of the share allowed and deducted from income for federal income tax purposes, not including any personal net operating loss deductions, to the extent that such net losses were not offset by the taxpayer's pro rata share of S corporation income otherwise subject to taxation pursuant to subsection p. of this section in respect of another S corporation, subject to rules of priority and assignment determined by the director.

For purposes of this clause, the term "control" means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80% of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation. For purposes of this clause, the term "a party to a reorganization" includes a corporation resulting from a reorganization, and both corporations, in the case of a reorganization resulting from the acquisition by one corporation of stock or properties of another.  In the case of a reorganization qualifying under subclause (i) by reason of subclause (vii) the term "a party to a reorganization" includes the controlling corporation referred to in such subclause (vii). Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, upon every such exchange or conversion, the taxpayer's basis for the stock or securities received shall be the same as the taxpayer's actual or attributed basis for the stock, securities or property surrendered in exchange therefor. d.    Net gains or net income derived from or in the form of rents, royalties, patents, and copyrights. e.     Interest, except interest referred to in clause (1) or (2) of N.J.S.54A:6-14, or distributions paid by a qualified investment fund as defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.310 (C.54A:6-14.1), to the extent provided in that section. f.     Dividends.

(cf: P.L.1998, c.57, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 of the year next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill provides a gross income tax exclusion for distributions from a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA that are made to a qualified charitable organization. A Roth IRA is a type of tax-advantaged individual retirement account that allows account holders to contribute after-tax dollars towards retirement. Contributions made to the account grow tax-free while qualified withdrawals, also known as distributions, may be made without incurring income tax liability, provided certain conditions are met.  Qualified distributions from a Roth IRA currently include amounts paid or distributed: (1) on or after the date the account holder attains 59 1/2 years of age; (2) to a beneficiary, or if a beneficiary has not be designated, to the estate of an account holder on or after their death; (3) for reasons attributable to the account holders disability; or (4) as a qualified first time home buyer distribution.  Distributions made for a non-qualified purpose are subject to taxes and penalties. A traditional IRA is another type of tax-advantaged individual retirement account that allows account holders to direct pre-tax income toward investments that can grow tax-deferred until the funds are withdrawn, at which point the money is treated as ordinary income and is subject to income tax.  In limited circumstances, certain interest, dividends and other earnings credited to an IRA can be withdrawn tax-free, provided those earnings are from investments in government debt obligations, such as bonds issued by the federal government, the State, or local governments. For the purposes of the bill, a qualified charitable organization is a charitable organization that receives tax exempt status pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the federal Internal Revenue Code.  Typically, organizations that receive this exemption are those operating exclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, literary, educational, testing for public safety, or other specified purposes.  Accordingly, the bill provides that distributions made from a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA to these organizations would be exempt from State income tax.

STATEMENT This bill provides a gross income tax exclusion for distributions from a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA that are made to a qualified charitable organization. A Roth IRA is a type of tax-advantaged individual retirement account that allows account holders to contribute after-tax dollars towards retirement. Contributions made to the account grow tax-free while qualified withdrawals, also known as distributions, may be made without incurring income tax liability, provided certain conditions are met.  Qualified distributions from a Roth IRA currently include amounts paid or distributed: (1) on or after the date the account holder attains 59 1/2 years of age; (2) to a beneficiary, or if a beneficiary has not be designated, to the estate of an account holder on or after their death; (3) for reasons attributable to the account holders disability; or (4) as a qualified first time home buyer distribution.  Distributions made for a non-qualified purpose are subject to taxes and penalties. A traditional IRA is another type of tax-advantaged individual retirement account that allows account holders to direct pre-tax income toward investments that can grow tax-deferred until the funds are withdrawn, at which point the money is treated as ordinary income and is subject to income tax.  In limited circumstances, certain interest, dividends and other earnings credited to an IRA can be withdrawn tax-free, provided those earnings are from investments in government debt obligations, such as bonds issued by the federal government, the State, or local governments. For the purposes of the bill, a qualified charitable organization is a charitable organization that receives tax exempt status pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the federal Internal Revenue Code.  Typically, organizations that receive this exemption are those operating exclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, literary, educational, testing for public safety, or other specified purposes.  Accordingly, the bill provides that distributions made from a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA to these organizations would be exempt from State income tax.
