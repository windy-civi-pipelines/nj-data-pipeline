minimum physical facility and program standards for juvenile detention

regularly over the maximum population capacity or is in willful and continuous
disregard of the minimum standards for these facilities or shelters, the
commission or department may restrict new admissions to the facility or
shelter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Upon making such
determination, the commission or department shall notify the governing body of
the appropriate county of its decision to impose such a restriction, which
notification shall include a written statement specifying the reasons therefor
and corrections to be made. If the commission or department shall determine
that no appropriate action has been initiated by the administrator of the
facility or shelter within 60 days following such notification to correct the
violations specified in the notification, it shall order that such juvenile detention
facility or shelter shall immediately cease to admit juveniles.  The county

facilities or shelters have adequate room for admitting juveniles and shall
assign the juveniles to the facilities or shelters on the basis of available
space; provided that the department shall not assign the juvenile to a facility

juveniles in the facility or shelter and which reflects all county expenditures
in maintaining such juvenile, including a proportionate share of all buildings
and grounds costs, personnel costs, including fringe benefits, administrative
costs and all other direct and indirect costs.</p>

cannot be located or will not accept custody of the juvenile.  Police and court
intake personnel shall make all reasonable efforts to locate a parent or
guardian to accept custody of the juvenile prior to requesting or approving the
juvenile's placement in a shelter or other non-secure placement.  If, after the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes various
revisions to the statutes governing juvenile justice.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
following standards apply to any juvenile who has been placed on probation and
who violates the conditions of that probation after reaching the age of 18; who
has been placed on parole and who violates the conditions of that parole after
reaching the age of 18; or who is arrested after reaching the age of 18 on a
warrant emanating from the commission of an act of juvenile delinquency: 1) in
the case of a person 18 years of age but less than 20 years of age, the court,
upon application by any interested party, is to determine the place of
detention, taking into consideration certain factors; and 2) in the case of a
person 20 years of age or older, the person is to be incarcerated in the county
jail unless good cause is shown. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the provisions of this
bill, the following standards apply to any juvenile who has been placed on
probation and violates the conditions of that probation after reaching the age
of 18 or who is arrested after reaching the age of 18 on a warrant emanating
from the commission of an act of juvenile delinquency: 1) in the case of a
person 18 years of age but less than 20 years of age, the court is required to hold
a hearing to determine whether it is in the interest of justice to detain the
juvenile in the county juvenile detention facility, an adult county jail, or a
secure facility operated by the Youth Justice Commission; and 2) in the case of
a person 20 years of age or older, the person is to be incarcerated in the
county jail unless good cause is shown, as provided under current law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, when a juvenile
who is detained in a county juvenile detention facility reaches the age of 18,
the court is required to hold a hearing to determine whether it is in the
interest of justice to continue to detain the person in the county juvenile
detention facility or transfer the person to an adult county jail or a secure
facility operated by the Youth Justice Commission.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At the hearing required
pursuant to the bills provisions, the court is required to determine the place
of detention taking into consideration the following factors: 1) the physical
and mental danger the person presents to other juveniles; 2) known gang affiliations
of the person; 3) the nature of the alleged crimes committed by the person; 4)
the history of prior delinquent acts committed by the person; 5) the physical
and mental maturity of the person; 6) whether the person presents any imminent
risk of self-harm; and 7) any other aggravating or mitigating factors the court
deems appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that notwithstanding
any provisions of law to the contrary, a juvenile may be detained in a secure
facility operated by the Youth Justice Commission pursuant to the bills
provisions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill also
grants a credit for time served in certain instances and establishes a
limitation on the amount of time between a juveniles intake and final
disposition.  Under current law, a prosecutor seeking to waive jurisdiction of
a juvenile delinquency case from family court to adult criminal court is
required to file a motion within 60 days, which time may be extended for good
cause.  This bill provides that a juvenile who is detained for the period of time
taken by the prosecutor to file the motion is to be credited with the time
served following the juveniles final disposition resulting in detention.  The
bill also requires that a trial of final disposition is to take place within
two years following the juveniles intake.  </p>
