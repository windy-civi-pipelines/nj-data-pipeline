The written notification shall include the same or similar informational materials about how to access community services provided by public or private agencies and organizations as those provided directly by a law enforcement officer to a person 18 years of age or older who commits a second violation of this paragraph.

If the violation is by a person under 18 years of age, [a] , the law enforcement officer shall transport the person into temporary custody and notify the parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the underage person that the underage person has been taken into temporary custody in accordance with section 3 of P.L.1991, c.169 (C.33:1-81.1a).  The officer also shall provide to the parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the underage person written notification concerning the third or subsequent violation [shall be provided to the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the underage person] in accordance with section 3 of P.L.1991, c.169 (C.33:1-81.1a).  The written notification shall include a referral for the person and the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the underage person for accessing community services provided by a public or private agency or organization, and provide notice to that agency or organization of the referral which may also then be used to initiate contact with both persons, and the agency or organization shall offer assistance to both with opportunities to access further social services, including counseling, tutoring programs, mentoring services, and faith-based or other community initiatives.

The failure of a person under the legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages or cannabis items, or the failure of a parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the underage person, to accept assistance from an agency or organization to which a law enforcement referral was made, or to access any community services provided by that agency or organization shall not result in any summons, initiation of a complaint, or other legal action to be adjudicated and enforced in any court. (2)  (a)  A person under the legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages or cannabis items is not capable of giving lawful consent to a search to determine a violation of this section, and a law enforcement officer shall not request that a person consent to a search for that purpose. (b)   The odor of an alcoholic beverage, marijuana, hashish, cannabis, or cannabis item, or burnt marijuana, hashish, cannabis, or cannabis item, shall not constitute reasonable articulable suspicion to initiate an investigatory stop of a person, nor shall it constitute probable cause to initiate a search of a person or that person's personal property to determine a violation of paragraph (1) of this subsection. Additionally, the unconcealed possession of an alcoholic beverage, marijuana, hashish, or cannabis item in violation of paragraph (1) of this subsection, observed in plain sight by a law enforcement officer, shall not constitute probable cause to initiate a search of a person or that person's personal property to determine any further violation of that paragraph or any other violation of law.

(4)   Consistent with the provisions of subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.2020, c.129 (C.40A:14-118.5), the video and audio recording functions of a law enforcement officer's body worn camera, as defined in that section, shall be activated whenever the law enforcement officer is responding to a call for service related to a violation or suspected violation of paragraph (1) of this subsection for possessing or consuming an alcoholic beverage, marijuana, hashish, or a cannabis item, or at the initiation of any other law enforcement or investigative encounter between an officer and a person related to a violation or suspected violation of that paragraph, and shall remain activated until the encounter has fully concluded and the officer leaves the scene of the encounter; provided, however, that the video and audio recording functions of a body worn camera shall not be deactivated pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of subsection c. of P.L.2020, c.129 (C.40A:14-118.5), based on a request to deactivate the camera by a person who is the subject of a responsive call for service or law enforcement or investigative encounter related to a violation or suspected violation of paragraph (1) of this subsection. (5)    As part of the process for the issuance of a written warning or write-up to a person for a violation of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the law enforcement officer shall take possession of any alcoholic beverage, marijuana, hashish, or cannabis item from the person, and any drug or cannabis paraphernalia for use with any marijuana, hashish, or cannabis item.

Any alcoholic beverage, marijuana, hashish, cannabis item, or drug or cannabis paraphernalia [obtained] discovered as a result of a violation of this section shall be seized by the law enforcement officer [shall either be] and destroyed or secured for use in law enforcement training or educational programs in accordance with applicable law and directives issued by the Attorney General.

These records shall only be used to the extent necessary to determine a subsequent violation of paragraph (1) of this subsection or to track referrals to agencies and organizations, and shall not be revealed, reviewed, or considered in any manner with respect to any current or subsequent juvenile delinquency matter, including but not limited to, a charge, filing, eligibility or decision for diversion or discharge, or sentencing, other disposition, or related decision affecting the juvenile, or with respect to any current or subsequent prosecution for committing an offense or other violation of law, including but not limited to, a charge, filing, eligibility or decision for diversion or discharge, or sentencing, other disposition, or related decision affecting an adult under 21 years of age. Also, these records shall be deemed confidential and shall not be subject to public inspection or copying pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), and their existence shall not be acknowledged based upon any inquiry in the same manner as if the records were expunged records pursuant to the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:52-15. The Attorney General may use the records described herein to generate the number of occurrences and other statistics concerning first, second, third and subsequent violations of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the municipal, county or other geographic areas within which first, second, third and subsequent violations occur, and the law enforcement agencies involved in first, second, third and subsequent violations, which are to be compiled and made available by the Attorney General in accordance with section 4 of P.L.2021, c.25 (C.2C:33-15.1). The identity of any person named in a record shall not be revealed or included in the information to be compiled and made available in accordance with that section. The records of violations shall only be maintained temporarily and shall be destroyed or permanently deleted as set forth in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph. (ii)   any records pertaining to a person's acceptance of assistance from an agency or organization to which a law enforcement referral was made shall not be revealed, reviewed, or considered in any manner with respect to any current or subsequent juvenile delinquency matter, including, but not limited to, a charge, filing, eligibility or decision for diversion or discharge, or sentencing, other disposition, or related decision affecting the juvenile, or with respect to any current or subsequent prosecution for committing an offense or other violation of law, including, but not limited to, a charge, filing, eligibility or decision for diversion or discharge, or sentencing, other disposition, or related decision affecting an adult under 21 years of age.

Upon final disposition of the matter for which the extended record retention was requested, the record shall be destroyed or permanently deleted. (d)   A law enforcement officer shall be guilty of the crime of official deprivation of civil rights as set forth in section 3 of P.L.2021, c.25 (C.2C:30-6.1) for violating the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection that address law enforcement actions involving persons who are under the legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages or cannabis items. b.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.25) c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.25) d.    Nothing in this act shall apply to possession of alcoholic beverages by any such person while actually engaged in the performance of employment pursuant to an employment permit issued by the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, or for a bona fide hotel or restaurant, in accordance with the provisions of R.S.33:1-26, or while actively engaged in the preparation of food while enrolled in a culinary arts or hotel management program at a county vocational school or post-secondary educational institution; and nothing in this section shall apply to possession of cannabis items by any such person while actually engaged in the performance of employment by a cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service as permitted pursuant to the "New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act," P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.). e.     Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.169 (C.33:1-81.1a) shall apply to a parent, guardian or other person with legal custody of a person under 18 years of age who is found to be in violation of this section. f.     An underage person and one or two other persons shall be immune from prosecution under this section if: (1)   one of the underage persons called 9-1-1 and reported that another underage person was in need of medical assistance due to alcohol consumption, or the consumption of marijuana, hashish, or a cannabis item; (2)   the underage person who called 9-1-1 and, if applicable, one or two other persons acting in concert with the underage person who called 9-1-1 provided each of their names to the 9-1-1 first responder dispatcher; (3)   the underage person was the first person to make the 9-1-1 report; and (4)   the underage person and, if applicable, one or two other persons acting in concert with the underage person who made the 9-1-1 call remained on the scene with the person under the legal age in need of medical assistance until assistance arrived and cooperated with medical assistance and law enforcement personnel on the scene. The underage person who received medical assistance also shall be immune from prosecution under this section. g.    For purposes of this section, an alcoholic beverage includes powdered alcohol as defined by R.S.33:1-1, a cannabis item includes any item available for lawful consumption pursuant to the "New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act," P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), and the terms "marijuana" and "hashish" have the same meaning as set forth in N.J.S.2C:35-2, and the terms "drug paraphernalia" and "cannabis paraphernalia" have the same meaning as set forth in N.J.S.2C:36-1 and section 3 of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-33), respectively. (cf: P.L.2021, c.447, s.4) 2.    A parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of a person under 18 years of age found in violation of R.S.33:1-81 or section 1 of P.L.1979, c.264 (C.2C:33-15) with respect to purchasing, possessing, or consuming any alcoholic beverage or cannabis item available for lawful consumption pursuant to the "New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act," P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.) shall be notified [of the violation in writing] that the underage person has been taken into temporary custody for the violation but has not been subject to arrest pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1979, c.264 (C.2C:33-15). The parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of a person under 18 years of age shall be subject to a fine in the amount of $500.00 upon any subsequent violation of R.S.33:1-81 or section 1 of P.L.1979, c.264 (C.2C:33-15) on the part of such person if it is shown that the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody failed or neglected to exercise reasonable supervision or control over the conduct of the person under 18 years of age. (cf: P.L.2021, c.16, s.71) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides that if a person under the age of 18 violates the law by purchasing or possessing alcoholic beverages or cannabis and receives a written warning from a law enforcement officer, the law enforcement officer would also be required to take the person into custody and notify the minors parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the minor that the underage person was taken into custody.  Under the bill, the minor would be taken into temporary custody but not subject to arrest. P.L.2021, c.25 established certain consequences for persons who purchase or possess alcoholic beverages or cannabis items when under the legal age to do so.  These consequences include notification to the minors parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the minor.  However, P.L.2021, c.25 does require that the minor be temporarily detained and the minors parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the minor be notified of the temporary detention. This bill requires that the minor be temporarily detained but not subject to arrest.  The bill preserves provisions of current law that prohibit a record of the minors possession of alcoholic beverages or cannabis in any juvenile delinquency matter.  The bill also clarifies that a law enforcement officer is required to seize from persons under 21 years of age any alcoholic beverage, marijuana, hashish, cannabis item, or drug or cannabis paraphernalia to be destroyed or secured for use in law enforcement training or educational programs.

The Attorney General may use the records described herein to generate the number of occurrences and other statistics concerning first, second, third and subsequent violations of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the municipal, county or other geographic areas within which first, second, third and subsequent violations occur, and the law enforcement agencies involved in first, second, third and subsequent violations, which are to be compiled and made available by the Attorney General in accordance with section 4 of P.L.2021, c.25 (C.2C:33-15.1). The identity of any person named in a record shall not be revealed or included in the information to be compiled and made available in accordance with that section. The records of violations shall only be maintained temporarily and shall be destroyed or permanently deleted as set forth in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph.

Upon final disposition of the matter for which the extended record retention was requested, the record shall be destroyed or permanently deleted. (d)   A law enforcement officer shall be guilty of the crime of official deprivation of civil rights as set forth in section 3 of P.L.2021, c.25 (C.2C:30-6.1) for violating the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection that address law enforcement actions involving persons who are under the legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages or cannabis items. b.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.25) c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.25) d.    Nothing in this act shall apply to possession of alcoholic beverages by any such person while actually engaged in the performance of employment pursuant to an employment permit issued by the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, or for a bona fide hotel or restaurant, in accordance with the provisions of R.S.33:1-26, or while actively engaged in the preparation of food while enrolled in a culinary arts or hotel management program at a county vocational school or post-secondary educational institution; and nothing in this section shall apply to possession of cannabis items by any such person while actually engaged in the performance of employment by a cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service as permitted pursuant to the "New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act," P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.). e.     Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.169 (C.33:1-81.1a) shall apply to a parent, guardian or other person with legal custody of a person under 18 years of age who is found to be in violation of this section. f.     An underage person and one or two other persons shall be immune from prosecution under this section if: (1)   one of the underage persons called 9-1-1 and reported that another underage person was in need of medical assistance due to alcohol consumption, or the consumption of marijuana, hashish, or a cannabis item; (2)   the underage person who called 9-1-1 and, if applicable, one or two other persons acting in concert with the underage person who called 9-1-1 provided each of their names to the 9-1-1 first responder dispatcher; (3)   the underage person was the first person to make the 9-1-1 report; and (4)   the underage person and, if applicable, one or two other persons acting in concert with the underage person who made the 9-1-1 call remained on the scene with the person under the legal age in need of medical assistance until assistance arrived and cooperated with medical assistance and law enforcement personnel on the scene. The underage person who received medical assistance also shall be immune from prosecution under this section. g.    For purposes of this section, an alcoholic beverage includes powdered alcohol as defined by R.S.33:1-1, a cannabis item includes any item available for lawful consumption pursuant to the "New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act," P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), and the terms "marijuana" and "hashish" have the same meaning as set forth in N.J.S.2C:35-2, and the terms "drug paraphernalia" and "cannabis paraphernalia" have the same meaning as set forth in N.J.S.2C:36-1 and section 3 of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-33), respectively. (cf: P.L.2021, c.447, s.4) 2.    A parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of a person under 18 years of age found in violation of R.S.33:1-81 or section 1 of P.L.1979, c.264 (C.2C:33-15) with respect to purchasing, possessing, or consuming any alcoholic beverage or cannabis item available for lawful consumption pursuant to the "New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act," P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.) shall be notified [of the violation in writing] that the underage person has been taken into temporary custody for the violation but has not been subject to arrest pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1979, c.264 (C.2C:33-15). The parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of a person under 18 years of age shall be subject to a fine in the amount of $500.00 upon any subsequent violation of R.S.33:1-81 or section 1 of P.L.1979, c.264 (C.2C:33-15) on the part of such person if it is shown that the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody failed or neglected to exercise reasonable supervision or control over the conduct of the person under 18 years of age. (cf: P.L.2021, c.16, s.71) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides that if a person under the age of 18 violates the law by purchasing or possessing alcoholic beverages or cannabis and receives a written warning from a law enforcement officer, the law enforcement officer would also be required to take the person into custody and notify the minors parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the minor that the underage person was taken into custody.  Under the bill, the minor would be taken into temporary custody but not subject to arrest. P.L.2021, c.25 established certain consequences for persons who purchase or possess alcoholic beverages or cannabis items when under the legal age to do so.  These consequences include notification to the minors parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the minor.  However, P.L.2021, c.25 does require that the minor be temporarily detained and the minors parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the minor be notified of the temporary detention. This bill requires that the minor be temporarily detained but not subject to arrest.  The bill preserves provisions of current law that prohibit a record of the minors possession of alcoholic beverages or cannabis in any juvenile delinquency matter.  The bill also clarifies that a law enforcement officer is required to seize from persons under 21 years of age any alcoholic beverage, marijuana, hashish, cannabis item, or drug or cannabis paraphernalia to be destroyed or secured for use in law enforcement training or educational programs.
