STATEMENT This bill amends N.J.S.A.2C:29-3, which prohibits hindering apprehension or prosecution, to impose criminal penalties for harboring an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States with knowledge that an arrest warrant or an immigration warrant has been issued for such an alien, or hindering the apprehension or deportation of such an alien. Under the bill, harboring or hindering the apprehension or deportation of an unlawful alien, with knowledge that the alien has an outstanding warrant, is a crime of the fourth degree.  An unlawful alien who hinders his or her own apprehension or deportation is guilty of a disorderly persons offense.  However, it is an affirmative defense that an unlawful alien was a victim of human trafficking during the time that the unlawful alien was hindering his or her own apprehension or deportation. A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  A disorderly persons offense is ordinarily punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.
