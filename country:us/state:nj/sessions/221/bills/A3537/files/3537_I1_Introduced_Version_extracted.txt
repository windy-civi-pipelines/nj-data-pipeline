(2)   The head of the ambulance, first aid and rescue squad shall seek reimbursement from the emergency medical technician, if the emergency medical technician ceases to be a volunteer in good standing, for monies paid out of the fund in connection with that emergency medical technicians training, testing, certification, or recertification, as appropriate, in connection with the initial three-year certification period in which the emergency medical technician ceased to be a volunteer in good standing.  The Department of Health shall exercise oversight authority over the collection of funds pursuant to this paragraph. d.    As used in this section, volunteer emergency medical technician means an emergency medical technician who provides basic life support services without receiving compensation in the form of an hourly wage, a salary, or any other form of financial remuneration provided for or in connection with the provision of basic life support services.

The bill would revise these requirements to provide that any agency, organization, or entity may be eligible for reimbursement from the fund for the unreimbursed costs of training and certifying a volunteer EMT, regardless of whether the ambulance, first aid and rescue squad employing or utilizing the services of the volunteer EMT charges for the provision of basic life support services.  The priority for reimbursement from the fund would be initial EMT training and certification classes and EMT refresher recertification classes. The bill requires that all reimbursements from the fund be promptly paid upon receipt of a qualifying application for reimbursement, which payment is to be made to the agency, organization, or entity that provided training to the volunteer EMT. The bill provides that the head of the ambulance, first aid and rescue squad employing or utilizing the services of an EMT, who received initial EMT training that was reimbursed by the fund, will determine the EMT to be a volunteer in good standing provided that the EMT works at least one service call per month during the initial three-year certification period as a volunteer EMT. A volunteer EMT is defined under the bill to mean an EMT who provides basic life support services without receiving any compensation, such as an hourly wage or a salary. The bill requires the head of the ambulance, first aid and rescue squad to seek reimbursement from an EMT that cease to be a volunteer in good standing for monies paid out of the fund in connection with the EMTs training, testing, certification, recertification, as appropriate, for that initial three-year certification period.  The Department of Health will exercise oversight authority over the collection of funds.
