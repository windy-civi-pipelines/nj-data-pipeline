State Police Retirement System and amending P.L.1965, c.89.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 30 of P.L.1965,
c.89 (C.53:5A-30) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     30.  a.  Subject to the
provisions of P.L.1955, c.70 (C.52:18A-95 et seq.), the general responsibility
for the proper operation of the retirement system is hereby vested in the board
of trustees, and, as specified, the committee established pursuant to
subsection o. of this section.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The board shall consist
of five trustees as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Two active or retired
members of the system who shall be appointed by the Superintendent of State
Police, who shall serve at the pleasure of the superintendent and until their
successors are appointed and one of whom shall be or shall have been a
commissioned officer of the Division of State Police. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Two members to be
appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, who shall
serve for a term of office of three years and until their successors are
appointed and who <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>shall<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>may</u> be
private citizens of the State of New Jersey <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>who
are neither an officer thereof nor active or retired members of the system<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>.  Of the two
members initially appointed by the Governor pursuant to P.L.1992, c.125
(C.43:4B-1 et al.), one shall be appointed for a term of two years and one for
a term of three years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The State Treasurer ex
officio.  The Deputy State Treasurer, when designated for that purpose by the
State Treasurer, may sit as a member of the board of trustees and when so
sitting shall have all the powers and shall perform all the duties vested by
this act in the State Treasurer.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Each trustee shall,
after his appointment, take an oath of office that, so far as it devolves upon
him, he will diligently and honestly fulfill his duties as a board member, and
that he will not knowingly violate or permit to be violated any of the
provisions of the law applicable to the retirement system.  Such oath shall be
subscribed by the member taking it, and certified by the official before whom
it is taken, and immediately filed in the office of the Secretary of State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.     If a vacancy occurs in
the office of a trustee, the vacancy shall be filled in the same manner as the
office was previously filled.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The trustees shall
serve without compensation, but they shall be reimbursed by the State for all
necessary expenses that they may incur through service on the board.  No
employee member shall suffer loss of salary through the serving on the board.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Except as otherwise
herein provided, no member of the board of trustees shall have any direct
interest in the gains or profits of any investments of the retirement system;
nor shall any member of the board of trustees directly or indirectly, for
himself or as an agent in any manner use the moneys of the retirement system,
except to make such current and necessary payments as are authorized by the
board of trustees; nor shall any member of the board of trustees become an
endorser or surety, or in any manner an obligor for moneys loaned to or
borrowed from the retirement system.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Each trustee shall be
entitled to one vote in the board.  A majority vote of all trustees shall be
necessary for any decision by the trustees at any meeting of said board.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Subject to the
limitations of this act, the board of trustees shall annually establish rules
and regulations for the administration of the funds created by this act and for
the transactions of the board's and committee's business. Such rules and
regulations shall be consistent with those adopted by the other pension funds
within the Division of Pensions and Benefits in order to permit the most
economical and uniform administration of all such retirement systems.  The
committee shall adopt such regulations as provided in subsection o. of this
section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The actuary of the fund
shall be selected by the Retirement Systems Actuary Selection Committee
established by P.L.1992, c.125. He shall be the technical adviser of the board
and the committee on matters regarding the operation of the funds created by
the provisions of this act and shall perform such other duties as are required
in connection herewith.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     The Attorney General
shall be the legal adviser of the retirement system, except that if the
Attorney General determines that a conflict of interest would affect the
ability of the Attorney General to represent the board or the committee on a
matter affecting the retirement system, the board may select and employ legal
counsel to advise and represent the board or the committee on that matter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    The Director of the
Division of Pensions and Benefits of the State Department of the Treasury shall
appoint a qualified member of the division who shall be the secretary of the
board.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     The board of trustees
shall keep a record of all of its proceedings which shall be open to public
inspection.  The retirement system shall publish annually a report showing the
fiscal transactions of the retirement system for the preceding year, the amount
of the accumulated cash and securities of the system and the last balance sheet

otherwise with regard to this process. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of subsections
c. through g., inclusive, of this section shall apply to the committee and its
members, as appropriate.  The committee shall keep a record of all of its
proceedings which shall be open to public inspection.</p>

with such actuaries or consultants, or both, in accordance with the provisions

implemented if the direct or indirect result of the decision will be that the
system's funded ratio falls below the target funded ratio in any valuation
period during the 30 years following the implementation of the decision.  The
actuary of the fund shall make a determination of the result in that regard and
submit that determination in a written report to the committee and the board
prior to the implementation of the decision.</p>
