(3) geographic limitations for energy storage projects and participating customers, prioritizing projects in urban areas and existing unoccupied industrial sites in the State; (4) a minimum number of participating customers for each energy storage project; (5) the value of the credit on each participating customer's bill; (6) the provision of access to energy storage projects for low- and moderate-income customers; (7) standards to ensure the ability of residential and commercial customers to participate in energy storage projects, including residential customers in multifamily housing; (8) standards for connection to the distribution and transmission system of an electric public utility; and (9) provisions to minimize impacts to the distribution and transmission system of an electric public utility. d.    The board shall make available on its Internet website information concerning energy storage projects that are seeking participants. e.     The board shall establish standards and an application process for owners of energy storage projects who wish to be included in the Community Power Storage Program.  The standards for the Community Power Storage Program shall include, but need not be limited to, a verification process to ensure that the energy storage projects are discharging an amount of energy that is greater than or equal to the amount of energy that is being credited to its participating customer's electric utility bills pursuant to this section, and consumer protection measures.  Projects approved by the board shall have at least two participating customers. f.     Subject to review by the board, an electric public utility shall be entitled to full and timely cost recovery for all costs incurred in implementation and compliance with this section. g.    The board shall prepare and submit an annual report to the Governor, and to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), on the effectiveness of the pilot program and make recommendations to amend, extend, or make permanent the program. 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes the Community Power Storage Program.  Specifically, the Community Power Storage Program is intended to permit customers of an electric public utility to participate in an energy storage project that is located remotely from their properties but is within their electric public utility service territory to allow for a credit to the customer's utility bill greater than or equal to the electricity discharged to the electric distribution and transmission system that is attributed to the customer's participation in the energy storage project. The bill provides the Board of Public Utilities (board) the authority to establish rules and regulations in order to effectuate certain requirements set forth in the bill.  The bill also requires the board to make available on its Internet website information on energy storage projects whose owners are seeking participants.  Under the bill, the board is required establish certain standards and an application process for owners of energy storage projects who wish to be included in the Community Energy Storage Program.  Finally, the bill allows an electric public utility, subject to review by the board, to recover the all costs incurred in the implementation and compliance with the bill.
