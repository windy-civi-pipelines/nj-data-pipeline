Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 9 of P.L.1973,
c.83 (C.19:44A-9) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.  a.  Unless already
established, each candidate, as defined in paragraph (1) of subsection c. of
section 3 of P.L.1973, c.83 (C.19:44A-3), shall, no later than the date on
which that candidate first receives any contribution or makes or incurs any
expenditures in connection with an election, establish (1) a candidate
committee, (2) a joint candidates committee, or (3) both, for the purpose of
receiving contributions and making expenditures.  No person serving as the
chairman of a political party committee or a legislative leadership committee
shall be eligible to be appointed or to serve as the chairman of a candidate
committee or joint candidates committee, other than a candidate committee or
joint candidates committee established to further the nomination for election
or the election of that person as a candidate for public office.  Subsequent to
an election, a candidate, whether or not successful in that election, shall
maintain a candidate committee or a joint candidates committee so long as
contributions are received or expenditures made by that former candidate.  An
elected officeholder who receives contributions and who has not maintained a
candidate committee or a joint candidates committee shall establish a candidate
committee, a joint candidates committee, or both, in a timely manner for the
purpose of receiving contributions and making expenditures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  (1)  The candidate or
candidates, as the case may be, shall file with the Election Law Enforcement
Commission a certificate of organization on a form prescribed by the
commission.  The certificate shall identify the name of the committee, which
shall be the sole name under which the committee receives contributions, makes
expenditures and otherwise does business and which shall include the surname or
surnames, as appropriate, of the candidate or candidates, except that in the
case of a joint candidates committee, the name of the committee need not
include such surnames if it identifies the legislative district, county,
municipality or other jurisdiction in which the candidates jointly seek
nomination for election or election and, in any case in which they seek
nomination for election or election as the candidates of a political party, the
name of that party, provided that no joint candidates committee so named shall
take the same name as that of any committee of a political party or another
joint candidates committee.  In the case of a candidate committee, the name of
the committee shall identify the office sought by the candidate.  The
certificate shall provide for the initial appointment by the candidate, or
candidates, of a campaign treasurer and for the designation by the candidate,
or candidates, of that treasurer of the candidate committee, or joint
candidates committee, as the campaign treasurer of the candidate, or
candidates, for the purposes of subsection a. of section 8 of P.L.1973, c.83
(C.19:44A-8) and shall generally identify and be signed by the candidate, or
candidates, and the chairman and the treasurer of the candidate committee or
joint candidates committee, as the case may be.  No person serving as the
chairman of a political party committee or a legislative leadership committee
shall be eligible to be appointed or to serve as the treasurer of a candidate
committee or joint candidates committee, other than a candidate committee or
joint candidates committee established to further the nomination for election
or the election of that person as a candidate for public office.  The
certificate shall be filed prior to or simultaneously with the filing of a
notification of the designation of a campaign depository as provided under
subsection c. of this section.  Upon the filing of such a certificate of
organization and until the termination of the committee, the candidate
committee or joint candidates committee shall file the reports which the
campaign treasurer or treasurers of the candidate or candidates would otherwise
be required to file under subsection a. of section 16 of P.L.1973, c.83
(C.19:44A-16).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Each campaign treasurer
of a candidate committee or a joint candidates committee for a candidate, or
candidates, for the Senate, the General Assembly or the office of Governor or
Lieutenant Governor shall be a trained treasurer, pursuant to subsection g. of
section 6 of P.L.1973, c.83 (C.19:44A-6), or shall acquire such training within
90 days of designation as a campaign treasurer. Any other campaign treasurer of
a candidate committee or a joint candidates committee may be a trained
treasurer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Each candidate, or the
candidates comprising a joint candidates committee, shall designate a campaign
depository.  Any bank authorized by law to transact business in the State may
be designated as the campaign depository.  Notification of the designation of
the campaign depository shall be made by the candidate's, candidates' or
committee's filing the name and address of such depository with the Election
Law Enforcement Commission no later than the tenth day after receipt by the
candidate or the committee of any contribution on behalf of the candidate or
candidates or after the making or incurring by the candidate or candidates of
any expenditure on behalf of that candidacy, whichever comes first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Each candidate and
campaign treasurer shall certify the correctness of each report filed by the
candidate committee or joint candidates committee with the commission and that
each report conforms with the limitations on contributions and expenditures
provided for in sections 18, 19 and 20 of P.L.1993, c.65 (C.19:44A-11.3,
C.19:44A-11.4 and C.19:44A-11.5).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     A campaign treasurer of
a candidate or candidates may appoint deputy campaign treasurers as required
and may designate additional campaign depositories in each county in which the
campaign is conducted.  The candidate or candidates shall file the names and
addresses of deputy campaign treasurers and additional campaign depositories
with the Election Law Enforcement Commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A candidate or
candidates may remove a campaign treasurer or deputy campaign treasurer.  In
the case of the death, resignation or removal of a campaign treasurer, the
candidate or candidates shall appoint a successor as soon as practicable and
shall file the name and address of that person with the Election Law
Enforcement Commission within three days.  A candidate may serve as his or her
own campaign treasurer.  One of the candidates in a joint candidates committee
may serve as the campaign treasurer of the entire committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    An individual who is a
candidate for two or more public offices in an election or in separate
elections shall establish separate candidate committees or separate joint
candidates committees or both for each office contested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  (1)  On and after the
