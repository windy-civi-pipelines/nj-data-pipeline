An Act establishing the New Jersey Wind Institute for Innovation and Training and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This act shall be known and may be cited as the New Jersey Wind Institute Act. 2.  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  Offshore wind, as a source of clean, renewable energy, provides opportunities for New Jersey to reduce dependence on fossil fuels that contribute to climate change, while significantly expanding and securing the States economy for the short and long term; b.  Because New Jersey is located in the heart of the East Coast development area for offshore wind, it is geographically positioned to be a supply chain hub for the countrys offshore wind industry; c.  The State has a goal of generating 7,500 megawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2035 as part of the States goal to transition to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, as stated in the 2019 Energy Master Plan; d.  Because offshore wind is an emerging industry in New Jersey, the State has a unique opportunity to promote the development of the offshore wind industry in order to ensure its longevity, inclusivity, and synergy with other industries in the State, and to ensure that the offshore wind industry reflects the diversity of New Jerseys population; e.  To further these goals, it is appropriate for the State to develop resources for education, research, innovation, and workforce training related to the development of the offshore wind industry in New Jersey and in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions; and f.  A New Jersey Wind Institute for Innovation and Training, acting in collaboration with other State agencies, can play a key role in the development of the offshore wind industry by leading the States coordination, promotion, and implementation of offshore wind workforce development, education, research, and innovation, with a particular focus on driving diversity, equity, and inclusion in this new industry. 3.  As used in this act: Board means the board of the New Jersey Wind Institute for Innovation and Training established pursuant to section 5 of this act. Institute means the New Jersey Wind Institute for Innovation and Training established pursuant to section 4 of this act. 4.  The New Jersey Wind Institute for Innovation and Training is created and established in the Executive Branch of the State Government.  For the purpose of complying with the provisions of Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, the institute is allocated in, but not of, the Department of the Treasury.  Notwithstanding this allocation, the institute shall be independent of any supervision or control by the Department of the Treasury or any board or officer thereof. 5.  a.  The institute shall be governed by a board consisting of nine members, as follows: (1) the Governor, or the Governors designee, who shall serve ex officio; (2) the President of the Board of Public Utilities, or the presidents designee, who shall serve ex officio; (3) the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, or the commissioners, who shall serve ex officio; (4) the Secretary of Higher Education, or the secretarys designee, who shall serve ex officio; (5) the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, or the commissioners designee, who shall serve ex officio; (6) the Chief Executive Officer of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, or the chief executive officers designee, who shall serve ex officio; and (7) three public members to be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.
