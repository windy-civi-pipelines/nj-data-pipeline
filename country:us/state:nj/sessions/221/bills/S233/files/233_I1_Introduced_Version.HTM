<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> establishing the New Jersey Wind Institute for
Innovation and Training and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  This act shall be known
and may be cited as the New Jersey Wind Institute Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  The Legislature finds and
declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  Offshore wind, as a source
of clean, renewable energy, provides opportunities for New Jersey to reduce
dependence on fossil fuels that contribute to climate change, while
significantly expanding and securing the States economy for the short and long
term; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Because New Jersey is
located in the heart of the East Coast development area for offshore wind, it
is geographically positioned to be a supply chain hub for the countrys
offshore wind industry;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The State has a goal of
generating 7,500 megawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2035 as part of the
States goal to transition to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, as stated in
the 2019 Energy Master Plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  Because offshore wind is
an emerging industry in New Jersey, the State has a unique opportunity to
promote the development of the offshore wind industry in order to ensure its
longevity, inclusivity, and synergy with other industries in the State, and to
ensure that the offshore wind industry reflects the diversity of New Jerseys
population;   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  To further these goals, it
is appropriate for the State to develop resources for education, research,
innovation, and workforce training related to the development of the offshore
wind industry in New Jersey and in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  A New Jersey Wind
Institute for Innovation and Training, acting in collaboration with other State
agencies, can play a key role in the development of the offshore wind industry
by leading the States coordination, promotion, and implementation of offshore
wind workforce development, education, research, and innovation, with a
particular focus on driving diversity, equity, and inclusion in this new
industry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Board means the board of the
New Jersey Wind Institute for Innovation and Training established pursuant to
section 5 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Institute means the New
Jersey Wind Institute for Innovation and Training established pursuant to
section 4 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  The New Jersey Wind
Institute for Innovation and Training is created and established in the
Executive Branch of the State Government.  For the purpose of complying with
the provisions of Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey
Constitution, the institute is allocated in, but not of, the Department of the
Treasury.  Notwithstanding this allocation, the institute shall be independent
of any supervision or control by the Department of the Treasury or any board or
officer thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.  a.  The institute shall be
governed by a board consisting of nine members, as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the Governor, or the
Governors designee, who shall serve ex officio;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) the President of the Board
of Public Utilities, or the presidents designee, who shall serve ex officio;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) the Commissioner of
Environmental Protection, or the commissioners, who shall serve ex officio; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) the Secretary of Higher
Education, or the secretarys designee, who shall serve ex officio;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) the Commissioner of Labor
and Workforce Development, or the commissioners designee, who shall serve ex
officio;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) the Chief Executive
Officer of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, or the chief
executive officers designee, who shall serve ex officio; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7) three public members to be
appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The chairperson of the board
shall be appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate,
from among the public members.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Each of the public members
appointed to the board shall have relevant experience in one or more of the
following areas:  workforce development; organized labor; education, research
and innovation; clean energy or offshore wind development; environmental
protection; or diversity and inclusion.  The public members shall be chosen to
provide relevant experience in different areas.  In the selection of public
members, a strong effort shall be made to solicit women and minorities as
candidates for appointment to the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The terms of the public
members of the board shall be for five years or until their successors are
appointed, except that, of the appointments first made to the board under this
act, two shall serve for terms of three years or until their successors are
appointed.  Any vacancy shall be filled in the same manner as the original
appointment but only for the balance of the unexpired term.  A member may be
reappointed to a second or subsequent term.  The members shall serve without
compensation but shall be reimbursed for necessary expenses incurred in the
performance of their duties, within the limits of funds appropriated or
otherwise made available to the institute for its purposes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  Each member appointed by
