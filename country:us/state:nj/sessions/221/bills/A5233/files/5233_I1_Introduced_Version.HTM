chapter 38 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes, and amending various parts

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) Sections 1
through 3 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as
this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the Protecting Legally-Present
Youngsters Limited Educational Resources (PLYLER) Act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section) The Legislature
finds and declares that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     In <u>Plyler v. Doe</u>,
457 U.S. 202 (1982), the United States Supreme Court held that illegal alien children
living in the United States could not be excluded from a free public education
based upon their immigration status. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The <u>Plyler</u>
decision circumvents the states authority over education.  The Tenth Amendment
to the United States Constitution provides: The powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are
reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In fact, the United
States Supreme Courts earlier decision in <u>San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v.
Rodriguez</u>, 411 U.S. 1 (1973), held that education is not a fundamental
right afforded explicit or implicit protection under the United States
Constitution.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Tenth Amendment, coupled
with the <u>Rodriguez</u> decision, makes clear that individual states are best
suited to determine the educational needs of their state and citizenry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Unlike the United
States Constitution, <span style='color:black'>the New Jersey Constitution
requires the Legislature to provide for the maintenance and support of a
thorough and efficient system of free public schools</span> <span
style='color:black'>for the instruction of all the children in the State
between the ages of five and 18 years.</span>  But this constitutional mandate
has never been understood to extend beyond the citizens of the State, those who
are legally residing here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     According to the
Migration Policy Institute, there were approximately 28,000 illegal alien
children enrolled in State public schools in 2019.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    While illegal alien
children enjoy the benefit of free public education, their parents often do not
pay their full tax responsibility.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The illegal alien population
of New Jersey has exponentially grown since the <u>Plyler</u> decision. According

legal resident children.  The <u>Plyler</u> decision circumvents the states
authority over education and has cost the State billions of dollars as illegal
alien children benefit from a free public education, but their parents often do
not pay their full tax responsibility.  <span style='color:black'>It is the
sponsors intent to authorize the </span>Legislature to exercise its reserved powers,
challenge the outdated <u>Plyler</u> decision, utilize public funds for United
