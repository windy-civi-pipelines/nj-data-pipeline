the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 5 of P.L.1996,
c.138 (C.18A:7F-5) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    As used in this section,
&quot;cost of living&quot; means the CPI as defined in section 3 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-45).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Within 30 days
following the approval of the Educational Adequacy Report, the commissioner
shall notify each district of the base per pupil amount, the per pupil amounts
for full-day preschool, the weights for grade level, county vocational school
districts, at-risk pupils, bilingual pupils, and combination pupils, the cost
coefficients for security aid and for transportation aid, the State average
classification rate and the excess cost for general special education services
pupils, the State average classification rate and the excess cost for
speech-only pupils, and the geographic cost adjustment for each of the school
years to which the report is applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>Beginning with State school
aid calculated for the 2026-2027 school year, the commissioner shall annually, no
later than the end of the first week in December, provide each district with a
preliminary State aid notice that details the minimum amount of State aid
payable to the district in the succeeding school year pursuant to the
provisions of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.).</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Annually, within two days following
the transmittal of the State budget message to the Legislature by the Governor
pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1944, c.112 (C.52:27B-20), the commissioner shall
notify each district of the maximum amount of aid payable to the district in
the succeeding school year pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-43 et al.) <u>or the amount of aid payable to the district in the
succeeding school year pursuant to the State budget message</u>, and shall
notify each district of the district's adequacy budget for the succeeding
school year.  <u>The commissioner shall, on the same date, notify each school
district of the projected Statewide property value rate and the projected
Statewide income rate to be used in the calculation of a districts local share
in the year following the succeeding school year.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the 2008-2009 school year
and thereafter, unless otherwise specified within P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.), aid amounts payable for the budget year shall be based on budget year
pupil counts, which shall be projected by the commissioner using data from
prior years.  Adjustments for the actual pupil counts of the budget year shall
be made to State aid amounts payable during the school year succeeding the
budget year.  Additional amounts payable shall be reflected as revenue and an
account receivable for the budget year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of this act to the contrary, each district's State aid payable for
the 2008-2009 school year, with the exception of aid for school facilities
projects, shall be based on simulations employing the various formulas and
State aid amounts contained in P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.).  The
commissioner shall prepare a report dated December 12, 2007 reflecting the
State aid amounts payable by category for each district and shall submit the
report to the Legislature prior to the adoption of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.).  Except as otherwise provided pursuant to this subsection and
paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 5 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-47),
the amounts contained in the commissioner's report shall be the final amounts
payable and shall not be subsequently adjusted other than to reflect the
phase-in of the required general fund local levy pursuant to paragraph (4) of
subsection b. of section 16 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-58) and to reflect
school choice aid to which a district may be entitled pursuant to section 20 of
that act. The projected pupil counts and equalized valuations used for the
calculation of State aid shall also be used for the calculation of adequacy
budget, local share, and required local share.  For 2008-2009, extraordinary
special education State aid shall be included as a projected amount in the
commissioner's report dated December 12, 2007 pending the final approval of
applications for the aid.  If the actual award of extraordinary special
education State aid is greater than the projected amount, the district shall
receive the increase in the aid payable in the subsequent school year pursuant
to the provisions of subsection c. of section 13 of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-55).  If the actual award of extraordinary special education State

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill modifies certain
provisions of school funding law, including requiring the Commissioner of
Education to take certain action concerning preliminary State school aid
notices and school district budgets, and creates the New Jersey Education
Funding Portal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that the
commissioner annually, no later than the end of the first week in December,
provide each district with a preliminary State aid notice that details the
minimum amount of State aid payable to the district in the succeeding school
year.  Additionally, within two days following the transmittal of the State
budget message by the Governor, the commissioner is to notify each district of the
projected Statewide property value rate and the projected Statewide income rate
to be used in the calculation of a districts local share in the year following
the succeeding school year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends
provisions of law governing to Educational Adequacy Report to require that the
Legislature adopt a concurrent resolution to approve the report or that advises
the Governor of the Legislatures specific objections to the report, rather
than deeming the report to be approved unless a concurrent resolution is
adopted objecting to all or part of the report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also revises the
definition of equalized valuation and district income used in a school
districts calculation of local share to provide that both measures are equal
to the average of the districts values for the preceding three years, except
that, when calculating the average, the value used for the prebudget year is to
be the lesser of the actual value for that year and the value for the year
preceding the prebudget year multiplied by 1.05.  For the 2026-2027 school
year, the value used for the prebudget year shall be the value for the year
preceding the prebudget year multiplied by 1.05.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill allows
a school district which is proposed to experience a State school aid reduction
to first submit its budget to the commissioner no later than five days
following the enactment of the appropriations act for the budget year and to
revise the districts budget at any point within the first six months of the
budget year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the
Department of Education to establish a New Jersey Education Funding Portal on
the departments Internet website which is to make available to school
districts and members of the public the data inputs and calculations used by
the department in formulating State school aid for all school districts.  The
portal is to allow individuals to adjust certain data inputs for a school
district, including enrollment, equalized property values, and district income,
and provide an estimate of the impact of these changes on the districts State
aid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill stipulates
that, for the 2026-2027 school year, the Statewide property value rate and the
Statewide income rate are to be the same as the rates used in the 2025-2026
school year, and the total amount of Statewide equalization aid available for
the 2026-2027 school year is to equal the sum of each school districts allocation
of equalization aid.</p>
