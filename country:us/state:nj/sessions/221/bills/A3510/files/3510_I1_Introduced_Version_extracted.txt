(cf: P.L.2013, c.5, s.5) 6.    Section 8 of P.L.1985, c.482 (C.40A:11-48) is amended to read as follows: 8.    Each contracting agency of a county or municipality which has established a qualified small business enterprise set-aside program, a qualified veteran business enterprise set-aside or joint venture and set-aside program, a qualified minority business enterprise set-aside or joint venture and set-aside program or a qualified women's business enterprise set-aside or joint venture and set-aside program shall submit a report to its governing body by January 31 of each year describing the agency's efforts in attaining the set-aside goals and the percentage of the dollar value of total procurements awarded pursuant to subsection b. of section 3 of [this act] P.L.1985, c.482 (C.40A:11-43).  The governing body shall publish a list of each agency's attainments in the immediately preceding local fiscal year, to include the county or municipal average, in at least one newspaper circulating in the county or municipality, as appropriate, by March 1 of each year. (cf: P.L.2013, c.5, s.7) 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would authorize local contracting units to establish women's, minority, and veteran business enterprise joint venture and set-aside programs.  The "Local Public Contracts Law" has authorized local contracting units to establish minority and women's business enterprise set-aside programs since 1985, and veteran business enterprise set-aside programs since 2013, as a way to encourage the growth and competitiveness of minority, women's, and veteran businesses. This bill would amend the current local set-aside law to permit a local contracting unit to set aside a percentage of the dollar value of total procurements to be awarded as set-aside contracts to joint ventures which include one or more qualified women's, minority, or veteran business enterprises.  This joint venture method, allowing traditionally disadvantaged women's, minority, and veteran-owned businesses to partner with more seasoned businesses into joint ventures, has been successfully employed in other places as a way to remove historic roadblocks that prevent disadvantaged businesses from competing in the public bidding process.

STATEMENT This bill would authorize local contracting units to establish women's, minority, and veteran business enterprise joint venture and set-aside programs.  The "Local Public Contracts Law" has authorized local contracting units to establish minority and women's business enterprise set-aside programs since 1985, and veteran business enterprise set-aside programs since 2013, as a way to encourage the growth and competitiveness of minority, women's, and veteran businesses. This bill would amend the current local set-aside law to permit a local contracting unit to set aside a percentage of the dollar value of total procurements to be awarded as set-aside contracts to joint ventures which include one or more qualified women's, minority, or veteran business enterprises.  This joint venture method, allowing traditionally disadvantaged women's, minority, and veteran-owned businesses to partner with more seasoned businesses into joint ventures, has been successfully employed in other places as a way to remove historic roadblocks that prevent disadvantaged businesses from competing in the public bidding process.
