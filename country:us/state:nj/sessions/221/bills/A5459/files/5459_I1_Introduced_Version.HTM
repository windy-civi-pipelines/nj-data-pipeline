<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 6 of P.L.1938,
c.366 (C.17:48-6) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    Every individual
contract made by a corporation subject to the provisions of this chapter to
furnish services to a subscriber shall provide for the furnishing of services
for a period of 12 months, and no contract shall be made providing for the
inception of such services at a date later than 1 year after the actual date of
the making of such contract.  Any such contract may provide that it shall be
automatically renewed from year to year unless there shall have been at least
30 days' prior written notice of termination by either the subscriber or the
corporation.  In the absence of fraud or material misrepresentation in the
application for a contract or for reinstatement, no contract with an individual
subscriber shall be terminated by the corporation unless all contracts of the
same type, in the same group or covering the same classification of persons are
terminated under the same conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No contract between any such
corporation and a subscriber shall entitle more than one person to services,
except that a contract issued as a family contract may provide that services
will be furnished to a husband and wife, or husband, wife and their dependent
child or children, or the subscriber and his (or her) dependent child or
children.  Adult dependent(s) of a subscriber may also be included for coverage
under the contract of such subscriber.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever, pursuant to the
provisions of a subscription certificate or group contract issued by a
corporation, the former spouse of a named subscriber under such a certificate
or contract is no longer entitled to coverage as an eligible dependent by
reason of divorce, separate coverage for such former spouse shall be made
available by the corporation on an individual non-group basis under the
following conditions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   Application for such
non-group coverage shall be made to the corporation by or on behalf of such
former spouse no later than 31 days following the date his or her coverage
under the prior certificate or contract terminated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   No new evidence of
insurability shall be required in connection with the application for such non-group
coverage but any health exception, limitation or exclusion applicable to said
former spouse under the prior coverage may, at the option of the corporation,
be carried over to the new non-group coverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   The effective date of
the new coverage shall be the day following the date on which such former
spouse's coverage under the prior certificate or contract terminated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   The benefits provided
under the non-group coverage issued to such former spouse shall be at least
equal to the basic benefits provided in contracts then being issued by the
corporation to new non-group applicants of the same age and family status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Family type contracts shall
provide that the services applicable for children shall be payable with respect
to a newly-born child of the subscriber, or his or her spouse from the moment
of birth.  The services for newly-born children shall consist of coverage of
injury or sickness including the necessary care and treatment of medically
diagnosed congenital defects and abnormalities.  If a subscription payment is
required to provide services for a child, the contract may require that
notification of birth of a newly-born child and the required payment must be
furnished to the service corporation within <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>60<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>90</u>
days after the date of birth in order to have the coverage continue beyond such
<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>60<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>90</u>-day
period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nonfamily type contracts which
provide for services to the subscriber but not to family members or dependents
of that subscriber, shall also provide services to newly-born children of the
subscriber which shall commence with the moment of birth of each child and
shall consist of coverage of injury or sickness including the necessary care
and treatment of medically diagnosed congenital defects and abnormalities,
provided that application therefor and payment of the required subscription
amount are made to include in said contract the coverage described in the
preceding paragraph of this section within <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>60<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>90</u> days
from the date of birth of a newborn child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A contract under which coverage
of a dependent of a subscriber terminates at a specified age shall, with
respect to an unmarried child, covered by the contract prior to attainment of
age 19, who is incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of an
intellectual disability or physical handicap and who became so incapable prior
to attainment of age 19 and who is chiefly dependent upon such subscriber for
support and maintenance, not so terminate while the contract remains in force
and the dependent remains in such condition, if the subscriber has within 31
days of such dependent's attainment of the termination age submitted proof of
such dependent's incapacity as described herein.  The foregoing provisions of
this paragraph shall not apply retrospectively or prospectively to require a
hospital service corporation to insure as a covered dependent any child with an
intellectual disability or physically handicapped child of the applicant where
the contract is underwritten on evidence of insurability based on health
factors required to be set forth in the application.  In such cases any
contract heretofore or hereafter issued may specifically exclude such child
with an intellectual disability or physically handicapped child from coverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Every individual contract
entered into by any such corporation with any subscriber thereto shall be in
writing and a certificate stating the terms and conditions thereof shall be
furnished to the subscriber to be kept by him.  No such certificate form shall
be made, issued or delivered in this State unless it contains the following
provisions:</p>
