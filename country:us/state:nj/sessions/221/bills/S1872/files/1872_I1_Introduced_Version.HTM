<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the
Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et
al.), to (1) clarify municipal planning or zoning authority, and (2) provide an
exemption from the Highlands permitting review program for certain development
along commercial corridors in the Highlands Region.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, this bill
provides that, notwithstanding any provision of the Highlands Water Protection
and Planning Act, or any regional master plan, or rule or regulation adopted
pursuant thereto, to the contrary, a municipality or county would not be denied
conformance approval or be deemed to have taken an action inconsistent with the
regional master plan if the municipality or county is exercising its planning
or zoning authority for property located within a commercial corridor in a
manner inconsistent with the regional master plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill amends
the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act to add a new exemption for
the construction or reconstruction of commercial or industrial development
within a commercial corridor.  This construction or reconstruction would be
exempt from the provisions of the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act,
the regional master plan, any rules or regulations adopted by the Department of
Environmental Protection pursuant thereto, or any amendments to a master plan,
development regulations, or other regulations adopted by a local government
unit to specifically conform them with the regional master plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines a commercial
corridor as the land area with frontage on a State, county, or rail
thoroughfare in the Highlands Region zoned for commercial or industrial use as
of August 10, 2004, i.e., the effective date of the Highlands Water Protection
and Planning Act, or, subsequent to that date, the land area along such a
thoroughfare that is deemed by a municipal planning board and governing body of
a municipality to be necessary for commercial or industrial use for the
economic viability of that municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is meant to encourage
reasonable and necessary economic growth in the Highlands Region as set forth
in the findings and declarations section of the Highlands Water Protection and
Planning Act that it is important to ensure the economic viability of
communities throughout the New Jersey Highlands; and that residential,
commercial, and industrial development, redevelopment, and economic growth in
certain appropriate areas of the New Jersey Highlands are also in the best
interests of all the citizens of the State, providing innumerable social,
cultural, and economic benefits and opportunities.  This bill would further
these findings and declarations by providing that commercial corridors along
well-traveled thoroughfares are appropriate areas for economic development in the
Highlands Region.</p>
