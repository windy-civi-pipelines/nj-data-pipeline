<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes certain
benefits for Class Two special law enforcement officers. Under current law,
Class Two special law enforcement officers only have full police powers while
on duty and are required to return their firearms to the officer in charge of
their station at the end of each workday.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill authorizes all Class
Two special law enforcement officers who successfully complete the statutorily
required training programs to exercise full police power and carry their
firearms at all times when in this State.  The bill also allows arson
investigators to carry a firearm at all times while in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill
establishes new requirements for Class One and Class Two special law
enforcement officers.  Specifically, the bill requires all special law
enforcement officers to be between 21 and 75 years of age and to submit to a
drug test at the time of appointment.  The bill also waives the training
requirements to become a Class Two special law enforcement officer for persons
who previously served as a full-time corrections officer, sheriffs officer, or
law enforcement officer.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also clarifies that
Class Two special law enforcement officers are granted the same protections as
all law enforcement officers.  Under current law, a simple assault is upgraded
to an aggravated assault if committed against a law enforcement officer while
clearly identifiable as being engaged in official duties or due to law
enforcement status.  Current law also makes it a fourth degree crime to
impersonate a law enforcement officer and a second degree crime to knowingly
take or attempt to exercise unlawful control over a law enforcement officers
firearm.  This bill clarifies that the same penalties for the crimes of
assaulting, impersonating, or disarming a law enforcement officer apply if
committed against a Class Two special law enforcement officer.  The bill also
specifically extends to Class Two special law enforcement officers the same
immunity from civil liability granted to regular full-time law enforcement
officers.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, Class Two
special law enforcement officers would be permitted to act as security at

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, special law
enforcement officers are prohibited from working more than 20 hours per week
except: 1) during periods of emergency, 2) in resort municipalities, 3) or to
provide public safety and law enforcement services to a public entity.  This
bill requires  counties and municipalities in which special law enforcement
officers work more than 20 hours per week to purchase liability insurance for
acts or omissions committed by special law enforcement officers acting in the
course of their official duties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also allows a
department, commission, or agency to dismiss a complaint filed by a private
citizen or an inmate against a regularly appointed, full-time law enforcement
officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer without full investigation
if it determines that the complaint does not constitute a violation of law or
departmental rule or regulation.  A complaint filed by a private citizen or an
inmate also may be dismissed if the complainant failed to substantially comply
with the complaint procedure prescribed by the employing department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill expands the
list of retired law enforcement officers who are eligible to receive a permit
to carry a handgun to include retired arson investigators and Class Two special
law enforcement officers who retire after four years of service.  Under current
law, certain retired law enforcement officers may annually apply for a permit
to carry a handgun, until those officers reach age 75, at which time they are
no longer eligible. The permit allows a retired law enforcement officer to
carry a handgun at all times.  Under this bill, retired arson investigators and
Class Two special law enforcement officers who retire after four years of
service would be eligible to receive a carry permit.  </p>
