"Investigation" means an action taken by the employing department, commission, or agency to determine whether a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer violated any law or department, commission, or agency rule or regulation and includes: (1) questioning any other State law enforcement officer or person; (2) conducting observations; (3) reviewing and evaluating reports, records, or other documents; and (4) examining physical evidence. b.    An employing department, commission, or agency may dismiss a complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate against a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer without full investigation if: (1)   the department, commission, or agency determines that the complaint does not constitute a violation of law or departmental, commission, or agency rule or regulation; or (2)   the complainant failed to substantially comply with the complaint procedure prescribed by the department, commission, or agency employing the officer. 12.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes certain benefits for Class Two special law enforcement officers. Under current law, Class Two special law enforcement officers only have full police powers while on duty and are required to return their firearms to the officer in charge of their station at the end of each workday. This bill authorizes all Class Two special law enforcement officers who successfully complete the statutorily required training programs to exercise full police power and carry their firearms at all times when in this State.  The bill also allows arson investigators to carry a firearm at all times while in this State. In addition, the bill establishes new requirements for Class One and Class Two special law enforcement officers.  Specifically, the bill requires all special law enforcement officers to be between 21 and 75 years of age and to submit to a drug test at the time of appointment.  The bill also waives the training requirements to become a Class Two special law enforcement officer for persons who previously served as a full-time corrections officer, sheriffs officer, or law enforcement officer. This bill also clarifies that Class Two special law enforcement officers are granted the same protections as all law enforcement officers.  Under current law, a simple assault is upgraded to an aggravated assault if committed against a law enforcement officer while clearly identifiable as being engaged in official duties or due to law enforcement status.  Current law also makes it a fourth degree crime to impersonate a law enforcement officer and a second degree crime to knowingly take or attempt to exercise unlawful control over a law enforcement officers firearm.  This bill clarifies that the same penalties for the crimes of assaulting, impersonating, or disarming a law enforcement officer apply if committed against a Class Two special law enforcement officer.  The bill also specifically extends to Class Two special law enforcement officers the same immunity from civil liability granted to regular full-time law enforcement officers. Under the bill, Class Two special law enforcement officers would be permitted to act as security at polling place on the day of an election to ensure that qualified voters are not obstructed from voting.  The bill authorizes the automatic expungement of criminal charges that are filed against any law enforcement officer, including any Class Two special law enforcement officer, in the course of official duties if the officer is found not guilty.  Class Two special law enforcement officers also would be entitled to paid leave to attend any State or national convention of the Special Police Organization. Under current law, paid leave is only granted to members of an organization affiliated with the New Jersey Policemen's Benevolent Association, Inc., the Fraternal Order of Police, the Firemen's Mutual Benevolent Association or the Professional Fire Fighters Association. Currently, special law enforcement officers are prohibited from working more than 20 hours per week except: 1) during periods of emergency, 2) in resort municipalities, 3) or to provide public safety and law enforcement services to a public entity.  This bill requires  counties and municipalities in which special law enforcement officers work more than 20 hours per week to purchase liability insurance for acts or omissions committed by special law enforcement officers acting in the course of their official duties. The bill also allows a department, commission, or agency to dismiss a complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate against a regularly appointed, full-time law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer without full investigation if it determines that the complaint does not constitute a violation of law or departmental rule or regulation.  A complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate also may be dismissed if the complainant failed to substantially comply with the complaint procedure prescribed by the employing department. Finally, the bill expands the list of retired law enforcement officers who are eligible to receive a permit to carry a handgun to include retired arson investigators and Class Two special law enforcement officers who retire after four years of service.  Under current law, certain retired law enforcement officers may annually apply for a permit to carry a handgun, until those officers reach age 75, at which time they are no longer eligible. The permit allows a retired law enforcement officer to carry a handgun at all times.  Under this bill, retired arson investigators and Class Two special law enforcement officers who retire after four years of service would be eligible to receive a carry permit.

Proof that the defendant was operating a hand-held wireless telephone while driving a motor vehicle in violation of section 1 of P.L.2003, c.310 (C.39:4-97.3) may give rise to an inference that the defendant was driving recklessly.

It shall be no defense to a prosecution for a violation of subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that the defendant was unaware that the prohibited conduct took place while on or within 1,000 feet of any school property or while driving through a school crossing.  Nor shall it be a defense to a prosecution under subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that no juveniles were present on the school property or crossing zone at the time of the offense or that the school was not in session. (4)   Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the third degree if the person purposely drives a vehicle in an aggressive manner directed at another vehicle and serious bodily injury results and is a crime of the fourth degree if the person purposely drives a vehicle in an aggressive manner directed at another vehicle and bodily injury results.  For purposes of this paragraph, "driving a vehicle in an aggressive manner" shall include, but is not limited to, unexpectedly altering the speed of the vehicle, making improper or erratic traffic lane changes, disregarding traffic control devices, failing to yield the right of way, or following another vehicle too closely.

(cf: P.L.2016, c.68, s.3) 9.    Section 9 of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.16) is amended to read as follows: 9.  a.  Except as provided in subsection c. of this section, a special law enforcement officer shall not be employed for more than 20 hours per week by the local unit except that special law enforcement officers may be employed by the local unit for those hours as the governing body may determine necessary in accordance with the limits prescribed below: (1)   In resort municipalities not to exceed 48 hours per week during any seasonal period.

STATEMENT This bill establishes certain benefits for Class Two special law enforcement officers. Under current law, Class Two special law enforcement officers only have full police powers while on duty and are required to return their firearms to the officer in charge of their station at the end of each workday. This bill authorizes all Class Two special law enforcement officers who successfully complete the statutorily required training programs to exercise full police power and carry their firearms at all times when in this State.  The bill also allows arson investigators to carry a firearm at all times while in this State. In addition, the bill establishes new requirements for Class One and Class Two special law enforcement officers.  Specifically, the bill requires all special law enforcement officers to be between 21 and 75 years of age and to submit to a drug test at the time of appointment.  The bill also waives the training requirements to become a Class Two special law enforcement officer for persons who previously served as a full-time corrections officer, sheriffs officer, or law enforcement officer. This bill also clarifies that Class Two special law enforcement officers are granted the same protections as all law enforcement officers.  Under current law, a simple assault is upgraded to an aggravated assault if committed against a law enforcement officer while clearly identifiable as being engaged in official duties or due to law enforcement status.  Current law also makes it a fourth degree crime to impersonate a law enforcement officer and a second degree crime to knowingly take or attempt to exercise unlawful control over a law enforcement officers firearm.  This bill clarifies that the same penalties for the crimes of assaulting, impersonating, or disarming a law enforcement officer apply if committed against a Class Two special law enforcement officer.  The bill also specifically extends to Class Two special law enforcement officers the same immunity from civil liability granted to regular full-time law enforcement officers. Under the bill, Class Two special law enforcement officers would be permitted to act as security at polling place on the day of an election to ensure that qualified voters are not obstructed from voting.  The bill authorizes the automatic expungement of criminal charges that are filed against any law enforcement officer, including any Class Two special law enforcement officer, in the course of official duties if the officer is found not guilty.  Class Two special law enforcement officers also would be entitled to paid leave to attend any State or national convention of the Special Police Organization. Under current law, paid leave is only granted to members of an organization affiliated with the New Jersey Policemen's Benevolent Association, Inc., the Fraternal Order of Police, the Firemen's Mutual Benevolent Association or the Professional Fire Fighters Association. Currently, special law enforcement officers are prohibited from working more than 20 hours per week except: 1) during periods of emergency, 2) in resort municipalities, 3) or to provide public safety and law enforcement services to a public entity.  This bill requires  counties and municipalities in which special law enforcement officers work more than 20 hours per week to purchase liability insurance for acts or omissions committed by special law enforcement officers acting in the course of their official duties. The bill also allows a department, commission, or agency to dismiss a complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate against a regularly appointed, full-time law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer without full investigation if it determines that the complaint does not constitute a violation of law or departmental rule or regulation.  A complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate also may be dismissed if the complainant failed to substantially comply with the complaint procedure prescribed by the employing department. Finally, the bill expands the list of retired law enforcement officers who are eligible to receive a permit to carry a handgun to include retired arson investigators and Class Two special law enforcement officers who retire after four years of service.  Under current law, certain retired law enforcement officers may annually apply for a permit to carry a handgun, until those officers reach age 75, at which time they are no longer eligible. The permit allows a retired law enforcement officer to carry a handgun at all times.  Under this bill, retired arson investigators and Class Two special law enforcement officers who retire after four years of service would be eligible to receive a carry permit.
