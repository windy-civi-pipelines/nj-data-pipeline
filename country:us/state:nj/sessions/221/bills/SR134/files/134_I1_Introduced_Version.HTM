SR134 SENATE RESOLUTION No. 134 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 5, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  MICHAEL L. TESTA, JR. District 1 (Atlantic, Cape May and Cumberland) Senator  JAMES W. HOLZAPFEL District 10 (Monmouth and Ocean) SYNOPSIS Expresses no confidence in BPU. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A senate Resolution expressing no confidence in the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. Whereas, The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) is charged with regulating the generation, transmission, and distribution of energy in New Jersey; and Whereas, Additionally, the BPU is required to ensure safe, adequate, and proper utility services at reasonable rates for New Jersey customers; and Whereas, New Jersey has historically been a net exporter of electricity, but under the current administrations energy policies, which have been implemented by the BPU, the State is now a net importer of electricity; and Whereas, As of February 2025, the price of residential electricity is nearly 20 percent higher for New Jerseyans than the national average, and the price of electricity across all sectors is over 27 percent higher; and Whereas, The BPU is responsible for certifying the results of the Basic Generation Service (BGS) auction, which determines, in part, the cost of electricity for many New Jersey residential and commercial ratepayers; and Whereas, In February 2025, the BPU certified the results of the BGS auction, which will lead to the average monthly electric bill in New Jersey increasing approximately 17 to 20 percent in June 2025; and Whereas, Increased electricity costs will present an affordability crisis that may force residents to make budgeting decisions that may have life-threatening consequences; and Whereas, The BPU has been aware that expected increases in demand for electricity would likely increase utility prices, but the BPU instead continued to promote electrification and renewable energy goals; and Whereas, The BPU has used ratepayer revenues to subsidize one-time payments to offset certain residential charges, instead of pursuing long-term affordability solutions; and Whereas, In November 2024, a BPU commissioner was quoted saying to the extent possible, we would encourage everyone for so many reasons  economic, environmental  to really cut back on their energy use whenever and wherever possible as a way for ratepayers to combat rising costs; and Whereas, In April 2025, a BPU commissioner was quoted saying that dissenting views within the BPU are often dismissed and marginalized and that BPU staff sometimes begin with expected results and shape their analysis to fit those outcomes; and Whereas, Under questioning at the joint meeting of the Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee and the Senate Select Committee, the President of the BPU indicated that that the board was going to continue prioritizing green energy policies at the expense of the ratepayer; and Whereas, The BPUs efforts to temporarily delay rate increases are an insufficient, delayed response to the BPUs failure to understand and regulate energy policy; and Whereas, Because of the foregoing reasons, the General Assembly no longer has confidence in the BPU to ensure ratepayers in New Jersey have access to affordable energy; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Senate of the State of New Jersey no longer has confidence that the Board of Public Utilities will ensure energy is provided to New Jersey ratepayers at an affordable and reasonable rate, and no longer has confidence that the board can successfully mitigate the impacts of rising energy costs for New Jerseyans. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the Governor and to the President and Commissioners of the BPU. STATEMENT This resolution expresses no confidence in the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU).  The BPU is charged with regulating the generation, transmission, and distribution of energy in New Jersey, and it is required to ensure safe, adequate, and proper utility services at reasonable rates for customers in the State.  However, the price of electricity in New Jersey is over 27 percent higher than the national average, and the average monthly electric bill in New Jersey is expected to increase approximately 17 to 20 percent in June 2025 following the Basic Generation Service auction, the results of which were certified by the BPU.  A BPU commissioner has been quoted encouraging ratepayers to reduce consumption, and saying that dissenting views within the BPU are often dismissed and marginalized.  Because of the foregoing reasons, the General Assembly no longer has confidence that the BPU will ensure energy is provided to New Jersey ratepayers at an affordable and reasonable rate, and no longer has confidence that the board can successfully mitigate the impacts of rising energy costs for New Jerseyans.
