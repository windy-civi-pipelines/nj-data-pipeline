of this act. When investigating a complaint, the Attorney General or county
prosecutor shall verify the work authorization of the alleged unauthorized
alien with the federal government pursuant to 8 U.S.C. s.1373(c). A State,
county or local official shall not attempt to independently make a final
determination as to whether an alien is authorized to work in the United
States. An alien's immigration status or work authorization status shall be
verified with the federal government pursuant to 8 U.S.C. s.1373(c).</p>

violation of section 4 of this act shall be brought against the employer by the
county prosecutor in the county where the unauthorized alien employee is
employed. The county prosecutor shall not bring an action against any employer
for any violation of section 4 that occurs before January 1, 2021. A second
violation shall be based only on an unauthorized alien who is employed by the
employer after an action has been brought for a previous violation of section
4.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Shall order the employer
to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county prosecutor within three
business days after the order is issued.  The affidavit shall state that the
employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens and that the
employer will not intentionally or knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. The
court shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses subject to
this paragraph (3) that are held by the employer if the employer fails to file
a signed sworn affidavit with the county prosecutor within three business days
after the order is issued. All licenses that are suspended under this paragraph
(3) shall remain suspended until the employer files a signed sworn affidavit
with the county prosecutor. Notwithstanding any other law, on filing of the
affidavit, the suspended licenses shall be reinstated immediately by the
appropriate agencies. For the purposes of this paragraph (3), the licenses that
are subject to suspension under this paragraph (3) are all licenses that are
held by the employer and that are necessary to operate the employer's business
at the employer's business location where the unauthorized alien performed
work. If a license is not necessary to operate the employer's business at the

necessary to operate the employer's business in general, the licenses that are
subject to suspension under this paragraph (3) are all licenses that are held by

unauthorized alien. All licenses that are suspended under this paragraph shall
remain suspended beyond the minimum 10 days required in paragraph (3) of
subsection b. of this section until the employer files a signed sworn affidavit
with the county prosecutor. For the purposes of this paragraph, the licenses
that are subject to suspension under this paragraph are all licenses that are
held by the employer and that are necessary to operate the employer's business
at the employer's business location where the unauthorized alien performed
work. If a license is not necessary to operate the employer's business at the
specific location where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license is
necessary to operate the employer's business in general, the licenses that are
subject to suspension under this subdivision are all licenses that are held by
the employer at the employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the
court's order and notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate agencies shall

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.    a.  In determining
whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider only the
federal government's determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. s.1373(c). The federal
government's determination creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's
lawful status. The court may take judicial notice of the federal government's
determination and may request the federal government to provide automated or
testimonial verification pursuant to 8 U.S.C. s.1373(c).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    For the purposes of this
section, proof of verifying the employment authorization of an employee through
the E-Verify program creates a rebuttable presumption that an employer did not
intentionally employ an unauthorized alien or knowingly employ an unauthorized
alien.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     For the purposes of
this section, an employer who establishes that it has complied in good faith
with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. s.1324b establishes an affirmative defense
that the employer did not intentionally or knowingly employ an unauthorized
alien.</p>

to effectuate the purposes of sections 2 and 3 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires every
employer, before hiring an employee, to verify the employment eligibility of
the employee through the E-Verify program. E-Verify is an electronic
verification of work authorization program jointly operated by the United
States Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration.
The bill provides for employers who employ 100 or more employees to comply with
the E-Verify requirement by December 31, 2020. Employers who employ less than
100 employees must comply with the E-Verify requirement by December 31, 2020.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development to develop a Statewide random
auditing program to inspect private employers for compliance with the E-Verify
requirement. The commissioner is also directed, upon receipt of a written and
signed complaint against an employer, or upon an investigation initiated by the
commissioner for good cause, to institute an investigation if the commissioner
finds reasonable grounds exist that an employer allegedly violated the E-Verify
requirement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides for the
assessment of a civil penalty of not less than $100 and not more than $1000 on
employers found to be in violation of the E-Verify requirement. For a first
occurrence involving a violation, if, upon notification by the commissioner,
the employer complies within seventy-two hours, the employer shall not be
assessed a penalty. Any subsequent occurrence involving a violation by the
employer results in the assessment of a civil penalty by the commissioner.
However, if the employer has not committed a violation of the E-Verify
requirement within the previous five years, a subsequent occurrence shall be
treated as a first occurrence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also prohibits the
employment of unauthorized aliens. It imposes penalties on employers who knowingly
or intentionally employ unauthorized aliens. For the first violation where an
employer knowingly hired unauthorized aliens, a court shall order the employer
to terminate such employment, to be subject to a three year probationary period
during which the employer shall submit quarterly reports for each new hire, to
file a sworn affidavit within three business days after the order has been
issued or face the suspension of any business license held by the employer
until such time a signed sworn affidavit is filed. In addition, a court may
consider a number of factors surrounding the violation and order the suspension
of any business license for a period not to exceed ten business days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the first violation where
an employer intentionally hired unauthorized aliens, a court shall order the
employer to terminate such employment; a five year probationary period during
which the employer shall submit quarterly reports for each new hire; the
suspension of any business license for a minimum ten days after considering all
factors surrounding the violation; and the employer to file a sworn affidavit
until which all licenses shall remain suspended. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For any second violation of
knowingly or intentionally employing an unauthorized alien, a court shall order
the permanent revocation of any and all of the employers business licenses
issued by the State or any political subdivisions of the State. </p>
