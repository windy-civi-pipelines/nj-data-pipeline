Cannabis Regulatory Commission (commission) regulates adult-use and medical
cannabis, the Department of Agriculture (department) regulates hemp, and the
Attorney General (AG) enforces criminal penalties against illegal marijuana and
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill synchronizes the
definitions of hemp, hemp products, and THC in order to regulate the sale of
intoxicating hemp products.  By means of updating the definitions of hemp, hemp
products, and THC, and adding a definition of intoxicating hemp products, the
bill clarifies the role of each agency.  The commission would be responsible
for regulating the sale of all legally produced intoxicating cannabis items,
whether hemp or cannabis; the department would continue to regulate the
cultivation and processing of hemp as an agricultural commodity; and the AG
would maintain the jurisdiction over illegally produced marijuana and THC,
including any businesses or individuals who fail to sell cannabis items through
a licensed retailer. <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Pursuant to N.J.S.A.24:6I-35,
and through the amended definition of cannabis item to include intoxicating
hemp product, the commission is required to promulgate regulations related to
the sale and purchase of cannabis items.  Further, pursuant to
N.J.S.A.24:6I-42, an entity is required to be licensed as a Class 5 Cannabis
Retailer in order to operate a business in which cannabis items are retailed. 
Thus, in order to sell an intoxicating hemp product, the business is required
to be a Class 5 licensee and is subject to product testing, labeling
requirements, and limitations on the sale of products to persons of a certain
age as established by the commission.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Intoxicating hemp product is

sold in this State that has a concentration of total THC greater than 0.5
milligrams per serving or 2.5 milligrams per package.  Intoxicating hemp

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, the bill amends the
New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, P.L.2019, c.238 (C.4:28-6 et seq.), to set
limits on the amount of THC that can be sold in hemp or hemp products.  This
limit is set at a total THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry
weight basis and additionally, for a hemp product, not more than 0.5 milligrams
of total THC per serving, and 2.5 milligrams of total THC per package.  Total
THC is defined as the total concentration of all tetrahydrocannabinols in a
cannabis item, including delta-8, delta-9, delta-10, tetrahydrocannabinolic
acid and any other chemically similar compound, substance, derivative, or
isomer of tetrahydrocannabinol, regardless of how derived or manufactured, and
any other cannabinoid, other than cannabidiol, identified by the commission, in
consultation with the Department of Agriculture and the Attorney General, as
causing intoxication.  This definitional change clarifies the departments role
in the regulation of hemp, and limits it to hemp or hemp products that meet the
limitations established in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also clarifies the definition
of THC in the Schedule I controlled dangerous substance statute,
N.J.S.A.24:21-5, to ensure THC produced by way of manufacture, and which is not

compounding, conversion, or processing of a controlled dangerous substance,
either directly or by extraction from substances of natural origin, or
independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction
and chemical synthesis, and includes any packaging or repackaging of the
substance or labeling or relabeling of its container, except that this term
does not include the preparation or compounding of a controlled dangerous
substance by an individual for the individual's own use or the preparation,
compounding, packaging, or labeling of a controlled dangerous substance: (1) by
a practitioner as an incident to the practitioner's administering or dispensing
of a controlled dangerous substance in the course of the practitioner's professional
