In August 2020, Navalny was poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent and medically evacuated to Germany for treatment.  Upon his return to Russia in 2021, he was immediately arrested due to accusations that he violated his parole conditions.  After his arrest, he received multiple prison sentences.  The time Navalny spent in prison was reportedly inhumane for reasons such as solitary confinement, extreme cold, unsanitary conditions, and harsh beatings.  Navalny was pronounced dead on February 16, 2024, at the age of 47, while imprisoned at the IK-3 penal colony, and many people were detained and arrested for attending his funeral as well as various memorials across Russia. The General Assembly of the State of New Jersey joins the rest of the world in condemning the Russian Federation and Vladimir Putins relentless targeting of Alexei Navalny to silence his message of resistance against corruption, which ultimately resulted in his death.
