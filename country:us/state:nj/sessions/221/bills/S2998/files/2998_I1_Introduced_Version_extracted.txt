STATEMENT This bill revises the eligibility criteria for adult medical day care services. Under the bill, a Medicaid enrollee is to be deemed eligible to receive adult medical day care services if the individual:  (1) requires assistance or supervision with at least one activity of daily living; (2) possesses a letter or prescription from a physician recommending the individual receive adult medical day care services; and (3) furnishes an up-to-date copy of the individuals medical history and a current report of a physical examination of the individual completed by a physician. The bill defines "activity of daily living" to mean a function or task that is completed for self-care.  Activity of daily living is to include, but is not to be limited to:  dressing, bathing, toilet use, transfer, locomotion, bed mobility, and eating.  "Adult medical day care" means a community-based group program designed to meet the needs of functionally or cognitively impaired adults through an individual plan of care structured to provide a variety of health, social, and related support services in a protective setting during any part of a day but less than 24 hours. Adult medical day care allows individuals with a functional impairment to remain in a community setting, rather than being institutionalized, and is the preferred method of providing services to this population.  It is the sponsors belief that the current eligibility criteria for adult medical day care services are too onerous, and prevent people who would benefit from adult medical day care services from receiving those services while remaining in their own communities.  It is the sponsors intent to ease the eligibility criteria for adult medical day care services in order to expand the population benefitting from those services.
