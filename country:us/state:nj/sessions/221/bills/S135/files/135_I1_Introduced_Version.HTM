(cf: P.L.2004, c.16, s.13) 9. Section 16 of P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-151) is amended to read as follows: 16.  a.   On or after December 31, 2005, every home improvement contract for a purchase price in excess of $500, and all changes in the terms and conditions of the contract, shall be in writing.  The contract shall be signed by all parties thereto and shall not contain any blank spaces for information, including but not limited to terms and conditions, to be added after the contract is signed by the consumer, and shall clearly and accurately set forth in legible form and in understandable language all terms and conditions of the contract, including but not limited to: (1)   The legal name, business address, and registration number of the contractor; (2)   A copy of the certificate of commercial general liability insurance required of a contractor pursuant to section 7 of [this act] P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-142) and the telephone number of the insurance company issuing the certificate; and (3)   The total price or other consideration to be paid by the owner, including the finance charges. b.    [On or after December 31, 2005, a home improvement contract may be cancelled by a consumer for any reason at any time before midnight of the third business day after the consumer receives a copy of it.  In order to cancel a contract the consumer shall notify the contractor of the cancellation in writing, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery, to the address specified in the contract.  All moneys paid pursuant to the cancelled contract shall be fully refunded within 30 days of receipt of the notice of cancellation.  If the consumer has executed any credit or loan agreement through the contractor to pay all or part of the contract, the agreement or note shall be cancelled without penalty to the consumer and written notice of that cancellation shall be mailed to the consumer within 30 days of receipt of the notice of cancellation.  The contract shall contain a conspicuous notice printed in at least 10-point bold-faced type as follows: "NOTICE TO CONSUMER YOU MAY CANCEL THIS CONTRACT AT ANY TIME BEFORE MIDNIGHT OF THE THIRD BUSINESS DAY AFTER RECEIVING A COPY OF THIS CONTRACT.  IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL THIS CONTRACT, YOU MUST EITHER: 1.    SEND A SIGNED AND DATED WRITTEN NOTICE OF CANCELLATION BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED; OR 2.  PERSONALLY DELIVER A SIGNED AND DATED WRITTEN NOTICE OF CANCELLATION TO: (Name of Contractor) (Address of Contractor) (Phone Number of Contractor) If you cancel this contract within the three-day period, you are entitled to a full refund of your money.

You are entitled to a copy of the contract at the time you sign. Keep it to protect your legal rights. Do not sign any completion certificate or agreement stating that you are satisfied with the entire project before this project is complete.  Home repair contractors are prohibited by law from requesting or accepting a certificate of completion signed by the consumer prior to the actual completion of the work to be performed under the home repair contract." d.    Any home improvement contract may be rescinded by the consumer, except as provided in subsection k. of this section if the consumer: (1)   Furnishes to the contractor a notice of intent to rescind the home repair contract by certified mail, return receipt requested, postmarked not later than 5 p.m. of the third business day following the day on which the home improvement  contract is executed; and (2)   Gives up possession of any goods, subject to a home repair contract, delivered to the consumer prior to receipt by the contractor of the notice of intent to rescind. e.     Within 10 business days after receipt of a notice of intent to rescind a home improvement contract, a contractor shall: (1)   Pick up, at the contractors own expense, any goods subject to the contract, delivered to the consumer prior to receipt by the contractor of the notice; (2)   Refund to the consumer all amounts of money paid by the consumer, less reasonable charges for any damages to any goods which occurred while in the consumers possession; and (3)   Redeliver to the consumer any goods traded-in to the contractor on account of or in contemplation of the home improvement contract, less any reasonable charges actually incurred in making the goods ready for sale. f.     Each home repair contractor shall maintain a record of the receipt of any consumers notice of intent to rescind a sale under this act for at least 18 months after the receipt of a notice of intent to rescind. g.    At the time of executing every home improvement contract subject to the provisions of this act, the contractor shall deliver to the consumer two copies of a receipt which clearly and conspicuously sets forth: (1)   The home repair contractor's name and place of business; (2)   A description of the goods and services sold; and (3)   The amount of money paid by the consumer or the cash value of any goods delivered to the contractor at the time the home improvement contract was entered into. h.    The receipt required to be delivered to the consumer shall also clearly and conspicuously include, in at least 10-point bold type, the following statement: NOTICE TO CONSUMER:  YOU MAY RESCIND THIS SALE PROVIDED THAT YOU NOTIFY THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTOR OF YOUR INTENT TO DO SO BY CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, POSTMARKED NOT LATER THAN 5 P.M. OF THE THIRD BUSINESS DAY FOLLOWING THE SALE.  FAILURE TO EXERCISE THIS OPTION, HOWEVER, WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH ANY OTHER REMEDIES AGAINST THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTOR YOU MAY POSSESS.  IF YOU WISH YOU MAY USE THIS PAGE AS NOTIFICATION BY WRITING I HEREBY RESCIND' AND ADDING YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS.  A DUPLICATE OF THIS RECEIPT IS PROVIDED BY THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTOR FOR YOUR RECORDS. i.     Except as provided in subsection k. of this section, a receipt required to be delivered by the consumer shall not contain, or be accompanied by, any document which contains provisions by which the consumer waives any rights under this act. j.     A contractor who in the ordinary course of business regularly uses a language other than English in any advertising or other solicitation of consumers, or in any printed forms for use by consumers, or in any face-to-face negotiations with consumers, shall deliver two copies of the receipt to a consumer whose principal language is not English, one in English and one in the other language. k.    A home improvement contract for home improvement work needed by the consumer to meet a bona fide emergency, where the contact with the contractor was initiated by the consumer, shall not be subject to the cancellation provisions of subsection d. of this section, if the consumer furnishes the contractor with a statement separate from the contract, in a form approved by the Division of Consumer Affairs, dated and signed by the consumer, describing the situation requiring immediate remedy and expressly acknowledging and waiving the right to cancel the contract within three business days. (cf: P.L.2004, c.155, s.4) 10.  (New section)    A county or municipal office of consumer affairs established pursuant to P.L.1975, c.376 (C.40:23-6.47 et seq.), that enters into a written agreement with the director in the form specified by the director to accept consumer complaints, directly or on a referral basis, and enforce this act against contractors whose principal place of business is in the county or municipality, shall be entitled to a share of registration fees paid by contractors having their principal place of business in the county or municipality as determined by the director by regulation. 11.  (New section)   The Dir ector of Consumer Affairs, pursuant to the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this act. 12.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the second month next following enactment, but the Director of Consumer Affairs may take any anticipatory action in advance of that date as may be necessary for the timely implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill clarifies that the exemption from certain requirements of the "Contractor's Registration Act," afforded to the persons listed in section 5 of P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-140), applies only to the registration, insurance, and bonding requirement for home improvement contractors.  All home improvement contractors would continue to be subject to the other requirements of the act. Under the bill, a consumer would be permitted to waive the three day waiting period during which the consumer would otherwise have the right cancel a contract for home improvements in the event that the work is necessary to meet a bona fide emergency. The bill would provide a funding source for restitution to consumers who have been damaged by a contractors violation of the "Contractor's Registration Act," by requiring registered contractors to post a bond. The bill establishes that a contractor would be liable for fines or penalties imposed on a consumer as a result of a contractors failure to obtain construction permits.  Work performed without a required permit, and thus not inspected by local building code officials, often violates building codes and zoning ordinances designed to protect the health and safety of residents. Finally, the bill makes it an unlawful practice under the consumer fraud act for a contractor to fail to complete a home improvement in accordance with the home improvement contract, and provides a consumer who suffers damage as a result of a violation of the "Contractor's Registration Act" with the remedy of restitution.  An unlawful practice is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense. Additionally, violations can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured party.

(1)   Any person claiming against the bond, letter of credit, or securities, moneys or other security may maintain an action at law against the contractor and the surety, bank, or director, as the case may be. (2)   The bond shall not be payable for treble damage claims pursuant to the consumer fraud act, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.). (3)   The director may make a claim against the bond, letter of credit, or securities, moneys or other security on behalf of a consumer, with notice to the registered contractor. (4)   The aggregate liability of the surety, bank, or the director to all persons for all breaches of the conditions of the bond, letter of credit or the securities, moneys or other security held by the director shall not exceed the amount of the bond, letter of credit, or the securities, moneys or other security held by the director. h.    Every bond required to be filed with the director shall provide that any consumer who may be claiming against the bond shall notify the director and the surety of the amount and nature of the claim prior to the initiation of any action at law against the contractor.  The bond shall provide that the surety may not pay any claim against the bond unless and until it shall have received authorization from the director to pay the claim. i.     If the director determines that there is a substantial likelihood that the aggregate amount of claims against a bond will exceed the available principal amount of the bond, the director may apportion the proceeds of the bond among the claimants in an equitable manner. j.     Every bond required to be filed with the director shall provide that cancellation or nonrenewal of the bond shall not be effective unless and until at least 10 days notice of intention to cancel or nonrenew has been received in writing by the director from the issuer. (cf: P.L.2014, c.34, s.4) 6.    Section 11 of P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-146) is amended to read as follows: 11.  a.   It is an unlawful practice and a violation of P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.) for a contractor to fail to complete a home improvement in accordance with the home improvement contract or otherwise, or to violate any provision of this act.  A contractor who violates any provision of P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-136 et seq.) shall be liable for restitution to a consumer who is damaged or suffers any loss as a result of a violation. b.    In addition to any other penalty provided by law, a person who knowingly violates any of the provisions of this act is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. (cf: P.L.2004, c.16, s.11) 7.    Section 12 of P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-147) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a.   This act shall supersede any municipal ordinance or regulation that provides for the licensing or registration of home improvement contractors or for the protection of homeowners by bonds or warranties required to be provided by home improvement contractors, exclusive of those required by water, sewer, utility, or land use ordinances or regulations. b.    [No] A municipality shall not issue a construction permit for any home improvement [to any] if any part of the home improvement is to be performed by a contractor who is required to be but is not registered pursuant to the provisions of this act. c.     A municipality may issue a construction permit for a home improvement only to: (1)   a contractor who is performing the home improvement and who is registered under this act; or (2)   a person who is performing the home improvement and is not required to be registered under this act.

(cf: P.L.2004, c.16, s.13) 9. Section 16 of P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-151) is amended to read as follows: 16.  a.   On or after December 31, 2005, every home improvement contract for a purchase price in excess of $500, and all changes in the terms and conditions of the contract, shall be in writing.  The contract shall be signed by all parties thereto and shall not contain any blank spaces for information, including but not limited to terms and conditions, to be added after the contract is signed by the consumer, and shall clearly and accurately set forth in legible form and in understandable language all terms and conditions of the contract, including but not limited to: (1)   The legal name, business address, and registration number of the contractor; (2)   A copy of the certificate of commercial general liability insurance required of a contractor pursuant to section 7 of [this act] P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-142) and the telephone number of the insurance company issuing the certificate; and (3)   The total price or other consideration to be paid by the owner, including the finance charges. b.    [On or after December 31, 2005, a home improvement contract may be cancelled by a consumer for any reason at any time before midnight of the third business day after the consumer receives a copy of it.  In order to cancel a contract the consumer shall notify the contractor of the cancellation in writing, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery, to the address specified in the contract.  All moneys paid pursuant to the cancelled contract shall be fully refunded within 30 days of receipt of the notice of cancellation.  If the consumer has executed any credit or loan agreement through the contractor to pay all or part of the contract, the agreement or note shall be cancelled without penalty to the consumer and written notice of that cancellation shall be mailed to the consumer within 30 days of receipt of the notice of cancellation.  The contract shall contain a conspicuous notice printed in at least 10-point bold-faced type as follows: "NOTICE TO CONSUMER YOU MAY CANCEL THIS CONTRACT AT ANY TIME BEFORE MIDNIGHT OF THE THIRD BUSINESS DAY AFTER RECEIVING A COPY OF THIS CONTRACT.  IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL THIS CONTRACT, YOU MUST EITHER: 1.    SEND A SIGNED AND DATED WRITTEN NOTICE OF CANCELLATION BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED; OR 2.  PERSONALLY DELIVER A SIGNED AND DATED WRITTEN NOTICE OF CANCELLATION TO: (Name of Contractor) (Address of Contractor) (Phone Number of Contractor) If you cancel this contract within the three-day period, you are entitled to a full refund of your money. Refunds must be made within 30 days of the contractor's receipt of the cancellation notice."] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     The contract shall include the following notice in 10-point bold type or larger, directly above the space provided for the signature of the consumer: "NOTICE TO CONSUMER Do not sign this contract if any of the spaces for information have been left blank. You are entitled to a copy of the contract at the time you sign. Keep it to protect your legal rights. Do not sign any completion certificate or agreement stating that you are satisfied with the entire project before this project is complete.  Home repair contractors are prohibited by law from requesting or accepting a certificate of completion signed by the consumer prior to the actual completion of the work to be performed under the home repair contract." d.    Any home improvement contract may be rescinded by the consumer, except as provided in subsection k. of this section if the consumer: (1)   Furnishes to the contractor a notice of intent to rescind the home repair contract by certified mail, return receipt requested, postmarked not later than 5 p.m. of the third business day following the day on which the home improvement  contract is executed; and (2)   Gives up possession of any goods, subject to a home repair contract, delivered to the consumer prior to receipt by the contractor of the notice of intent to rescind. e.     Within 10 business days after receipt of a notice of intent to rescind a home improvement contract, a contractor shall: (1)   Pick up, at the contractors own expense, any goods subject to the contract, delivered to the consumer prior to receipt by the contractor of the notice; (2)   Refund to the consumer all amounts of money paid by the consumer, less reasonable charges for any damages to any goods which occurred while in the consumers possession; and (3)   Redeliver to the consumer any goods traded-in to the contractor on account of or in contemplation of the home improvement contract, less any reasonable charges actually incurred in making the goods ready for sale. f.     Each home repair contractor shall maintain a record of the receipt of any consumers notice of intent to rescind a sale under this act for at least 18 months after the receipt of a notice of intent to rescind. g.    At the time of executing every home improvement contract subject to the provisions of this act, the contractor shall deliver to the consumer two copies of a receipt which clearly and conspicuously sets forth: (1)   The home repair contractor's name and place of business; (2)   A description of the goods and services sold; and (3)   The amount of money paid by the consumer or the cash value of any goods delivered to the contractor at the time the home improvement contract was entered into. h.    The receipt required to be delivered to the consumer shall also clearly and conspicuously include, in at least 10-point bold type, the following statement: NOTICE TO CONSUMER:  YOU MAY RESCIND THIS SALE PROVIDED THAT YOU NOTIFY THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTOR OF YOUR INTENT TO DO SO BY CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, POSTMARKED NOT LATER THAN 5 P.M. OF THE THIRD BUSINESS DAY FOLLOWING THE SALE.  FAILURE TO EXERCISE THIS OPTION, HOWEVER, WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH ANY OTHER REMEDIES AGAINST THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTOR YOU MAY POSSESS.  IF YOU WISH YOU MAY USE THIS PAGE AS NOTIFICATION BY WRITING I HEREBY RESCIND' AND ADDING YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS.  A DUPLICATE OF THIS RECEIPT IS PROVIDED BY THE HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTOR FOR YOUR RECORDS. i.     Except as provided in subsection k. of this section, a receipt required to be delivered by the consumer shall not contain, or be accompanied by, any document which contains provisions by which the consumer waives any rights under this act. j.     A contractor who in the ordinary course of business regularly uses a language other than English in any advertising or other solicitation of consumers, or in any printed forms for use by consumers, or in any face-to-face negotiations with consumers, shall deliver two copies of the receipt to a consumer whose principal language is not English, one in English and one in the other language. k.    A home improvement contract for home improvement work needed by the consumer to meet a bona fide emergency, where the contact with the contractor was initiated by the consumer, shall not be subject to the cancellation provisions of subsection d. of this section, if the consumer furnishes the contractor with a statement separate from the contract, in a form approved by the Division of Consumer Affairs, dated and signed by the consumer, describing the situation requiring immediate remedy and expressly acknowledging and waiving the right to cancel the contract within three business days. (cf: P.L.2004, c.155, s.4) 10.  (New section)    A county or municipal office of consumer affairs established pursuant to P.L.1975, c.376 (C.40:23-6.47 et seq.), that enters into a written agreement with the director in the form specified by the director to accept consumer complaints, directly or on a referral basis, and enforce this act against contractors whose principal place of business is in the county or municipality, shall be entitled to a share of registration fees paid by contractors having their principal place of business in the county or municipality as determined by the director by regulation. 11.  (New section)   The Dir ector of Consumer Affairs, pursuant to the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this act. 12.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the second month next following enactment, but the Director of Consumer Affairs may take any anticipatory action in advance of that date as may be necessary for the timely implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill clarifies that the exemption from certain requirements of the "Contractor's Registration Act," afforded to the persons listed in section 5 of P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-140), applies only to the registration, insurance, and bonding requirement for home improvement contractors.  All home improvement contractors would continue to be subject to the other requirements of the act. Under the bill, a consumer would be permitted to waive the three day waiting period during which the consumer would otherwise have the right cancel a contract for home improvements in the event that the work is necessary to meet a bona fide emergency. The bill would provide a funding source for restitution to consumers who have been damaged by a contractors violation of the "Contractor's Registration Act," by requiring registered contractors to post a bond. The bill establishes that a contractor would be liable for fines or penalties imposed on a consumer as a result of a contractors failure to obtain construction permits.  Work performed without a required permit, and thus not inspected by local building code officials, often violates building codes and zoning ordinances designed to protect the health and safety of residents. Finally, the bill makes it an unlawful practice under the consumer fraud act for a contractor to fail to complete a home improvement in accordance with the home improvement contract, and provides a consumer who suffers damage as a result of a violation of the "Contractor's Registration Act" with the remedy of restitution.  An unlawful practice is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense. Additionally, violations can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured party.
