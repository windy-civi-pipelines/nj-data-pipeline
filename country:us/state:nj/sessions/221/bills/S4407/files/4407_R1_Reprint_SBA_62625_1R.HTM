<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) 
P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited
as the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Manufacturers are vital
contributors to the State's economic health and overall prosperity.  They serve
as engines of growth, driving job creation, stimulating innovation, and
fostering a robust and productive workforce. By producing goods and
contributing to the supply chain, manufacturing facilities bolster the State's
competitiveness in the global market. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Projects involving
manufacturing and manufacturers are inherently beneficial to the State because
they provide vital contributions to the communities in which they are located,
enhancing the quality of life for residents, and producing immeasurable
economic benefits to the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Next New Jersey
Manufacturing Program is a comprehensive tax credit program designed to drive
substantial investment, foster the creation of new jobs, and position New
Jersey as a leader in the manufacturing economy. The program will encourage a
wide range of manufacturing activities benefitting various industries, including
advanced manufacturing; non-retail food and beverage; life sciences; defense; and
the production of components for clean energy technologies, such as offshore
wind, solar, geothermal, green hydrogen, nuclear energy, fuel cells, battery
storage, and other sustainable clean energy solutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    By offering competitive
incentives, the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program encourages companies to
allocate their capital investments to New Jersey while demonstrating a
long-term commitment to the States economic growth. The program is designed
for manufacturing facilities that establish or expand their physical presence
in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  As used
in P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Affiliate means an entity
that directly or indirectly controls, is under common control with, or is
controlled by an eligible business. Control exists in all cases in which the
entity is a member of a controlled group of corporations as defined pursuant to
section 1563 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.1563) or the
entity is an organization in a group of organizations under common control that
is subject to the regulations applicable to organizations pursuant to
subsection (b) or (c) of section 414 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26
U.S.C. s.414).  A taxpayer may establish by clear and convincing evidence, as
determined by the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the
Treasury, that control exists in situations involving lesser percentages of
ownership than required by sections 1563 and 414 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ss.1563 and 414). An affiliate of a business may contribute
to meeting either the capital investment or full-time employee requirements of
a business and new full-time job requirements and may satisfy the requirement
for site control during construction and the eligibility period, but in no
event shall the tax credit certificate be issued to any affiliate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Authority means the New
Jersey Economic Development Authority established by section 4 of P.L.1974,
c.80 (C.34:1B-4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Board means the Board of the
New Jersey Economic Development Authority, established by section 4 of P.L.1974,
c.80 (C.34:1B-4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Building services means any
cleaning or routine building maintenance work, including but not limited to
sweeping, vacuuming, floor cleaning, cleaning of rest rooms, collecting refuse
or trash, window cleaning, securing, patrolling, or other work in connection
