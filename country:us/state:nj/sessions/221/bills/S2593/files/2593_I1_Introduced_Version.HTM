<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would authorize the
use of constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues to
provide grants to local governments to fund sewer or stormwater infrastructure
projects that reduce nonpoint source pollution of the State's lakes and
reservoirs, and help prevent harmful algal blooms.  The bill would allow monies
from the &quot;Watershed Management Fund,&quot; which was established by the
&quot;Watershed Protection and Management Act of 1997,&quot; P.L.1997, c.261
(C.58:29-1 et seq.), to be used to fund the grants.  The bill also clarifies
that the &quot;Watershed Management Fund&quot; would serve as the repository
for the 0.3 percent of annual CBT revenues that are constitutionally dedicated
to paying or financing the cost of water quality point and nonpoint source
pollution monitoring, watershed based water resource planning and management,
and nonpoint source pollution prevention projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also amend the
&quot;Preserve New Jersey Act&quot; to authorize a portion of CBT
revenuesnamely those dedicated to the provision of grants and loans to assist
local government units to pay the cost of acquisition and development of lands
for recreation and conservation purposesto be used to provide grants to local
government units to fund 100 percent of the costs of projects undertaken for
the management and maintenance of lakes and reservoirs with the aim of
preventing or mitigating harmful algal blooms.  The amount authorized is
approximately 0.17 percent of annual CBT revenues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that both kinds of grants can be used as matching funds by local government
units for the purpose of obtaining other grants, including State or federal
grants.</p>
