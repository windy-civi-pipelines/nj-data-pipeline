(1) In addition to the purposes set forth in subsection d. of this section, moneys in the Preserve New Jersey Green Acres Fund may be applied for the purposes of providing moneys to: (a)   meet the Blue Acres costs to the State for the acquisition of lands for a Blue Acres project; or (b)   provide grants, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, to assist a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization in meeting the Blue Acres costs for the acquisition of lands for a Blue Acres project. (2)   A grant by the State for lands to be acquired by a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization for a Blue Acres project may include up to 50 percent of the Blue Acres cost of acquisition of the lands by the qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization. (a)   A qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization shall not use as its matching share of the Blue Acres cost of acquisition of lands for a Blue Acres project any constitutionally dedicated moneys, as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-3), or any grant moneys obtained from a Green Acres bond act. (b)   To qualify to receive a grant from the Preserve New Jersey Blue Acres Fund, the board of directors or governing body of the applying tax exempt nonprofit organization shall: (i)    demonstrate to the commissioner that the organization qualifies as a charitable conservancy for the purposes of P.L.1979, c.378 (C.13:8B-1 et seq.); (ii)   demonstrate that the organization has the resources to match the grant requested; (iii)  agree to make and keep the lands accessible to the public, unless the commissioner determines that public accessibility would be detrimental to the lands or any natural resources associated therewith; (iv)  agree not to convey the lands except to the federal government, the State, a local government unit, or another qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization, for recreation and conservation purposes; and (v)   agree to execute and donate to the State at no charge a conservation restriction pursuant to P.L.1979, c.378 (C.13:8B-1 et seq.) on the lands to be acquired with the grant. l.     In addition to any other reporting requirements required by law, the department shall annually send a written report to the Chairperson of the Senate Environment and Energy Committee, the Assembly Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, and the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee, or their successors, identifying the projects funded with moneys pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of subsection j. of this section.  This report shall:  (1) identify the project type, location, and cost for each development project; and (2) identify the stewardship activities, including the location and cost for each stewardship activity, undertaken on lands administered by the Division of Fish and Wildlife and Division of Parks and Forestry pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of subsection j. of this section. (cf: P.L.2019, c.136, s.3) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would authorize the use of constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues to provide grants to local governments to fund sewer or stormwater infrastructure projects that reduce nonpoint source pollution of the State's lakes and reservoirs, and help prevent harmful algal blooms.  The bill would allow monies from the "Watershed Management Fund," which was established by the "Watershed Protection and Management Act of 1997," P.L.1997, c.261 (C.58:29-1 et seq.), to be used to fund the grants.  The bill also clarifies that the "Watershed Management Fund" would serve as the repository for the 0.3 percent of annual CBT revenues that are constitutionally dedicated to paying or financing the cost of water quality point and nonpoint source pollution monitoring, watershed based water resource planning and management, and nonpoint source pollution prevention projects. The bill would also amend the "Preserve New Jersey Act" to authorize a portion of CBT revenuesnamely those dedicated to the provision of grants and loans to assist local government units to pay the cost of acquisition and development of lands for recreation and conservation purposesto be used to provide grants to local government units to fund 100 percent of the costs of projects undertaken for the management and maintenance of lakes and reservoirs with the aim of preventing or mitigating harmful algal blooms.  The amount authorized is approximately 0.17 percent of annual CBT revenues. Finally, the bill provides that both kinds of grants can be used as matching funds by local government units for the purpose of obtaining other grants, including State or federal grants.

(b)   To qualify to receive a grant from the Preserve New Jersey Blue Acres Fund, the board of directors or governing body of the applying tax exempt nonprofit organization shall: (i)    demonstrate to the commissioner that the organization qualifies as a charitable conservancy for the purposes of P.L.1979, c.378 (C.13:8B-1 et seq.); (ii)   demonstrate that the organization has the resources to match the grant requested; (iii)  agree to make and keep the lands accessible to the public, unless the commissioner determines that public accessibility would be detrimental to the lands or any natural resources associated therewith; (iv)  agree not to convey the lands except to the federal government, the State, a local government unit, or another qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization, for recreation and conservation purposes; and (v)   agree to execute and donate to the State at no charge a conservation restriction pursuant to P.L.1979, c.378 (C.13:8B-1 et seq.) on the lands to be acquired with the grant. l.     In addition to any other reporting requirements required by law, the department shall annually send a written report to the Chairperson of the Senate Environment and Energy Committee, the Assembly Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, and the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee, or their successors, identifying the projects funded with moneys pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of subsection j. of this section.  This report shall:  (1) identify the project type, location, and cost for each development project; and (2) identify the stewardship activities, including the location and cost for each stewardship activity, undertaken on lands administered by the Division of Fish and Wildlife and Division of Parks and Forestry pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of subsection j. of this section. (cf: P.L.2019, c.136, s.3) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would authorize the use of constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues to provide grants to local governments to fund sewer or stormwater infrastructure projects that reduce nonpoint source pollution of the State's lakes and reservoirs, and help prevent harmful algal blooms.  The bill would allow monies from the "Watershed Management Fund," which was established by the "Watershed Protection and Management Act of 1997," P.L.1997, c.261 (C.58:29-1 et seq.), to be used to fund the grants.  The bill also clarifies that the "Watershed Management Fund" would serve as the repository for the 0.3 percent of annual CBT revenues that are constitutionally dedicated to paying or financing the cost of water quality point and nonpoint source pollution monitoring, watershed based water resource planning and management, and nonpoint source pollution prevention projects. The bill would also amend the "Preserve New Jersey Act" to authorize a portion of CBT revenuesnamely those dedicated to the provision of grants and loans to assist local government units to pay the cost of acquisition and development of lands for recreation and conservation purposesto be used to provide grants to local government units to fund 100 percent of the costs of projects undertaken for the management and maintenance of lakes and reservoirs with the aim of preventing or mitigating harmful algal blooms.  The amount authorized is approximately 0.17 percent of annual CBT revenues. Finally, the bill provides that both kinds of grants can be used as matching funds by local government units for the purpose of obtaining other grants, including State or federal grants.
