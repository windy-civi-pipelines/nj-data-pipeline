A802 ASSEMBLY, No. 802 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  GREGORY P.

CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning protection of the Barnegat Bay estuary watershed, and supplementing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Sections 1 through 7 of this act shall be known and may be cited as the Barnegat Bay Protection Act. 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     New Jerseys Barnegat Bay estuary watershed is one of the States most precious natural resources, and this shallow lagoonal estuary is now significantly affected by an array of human impacts that potentially threaten its ecological integrity; b.    The Barnegat Bay estuary watershed encompasses most of the 33 municipalities in Ocean County and four municipalities in Monmouth County, supports a population of over 500,000 people that more than doubles during the summer season, and also provides economic, ecological, aesthetic, and recreational benefits; c.     Eutrophication exists in the Barnegat Bay, caused in part by nutrient loadings from nonpoint pollution sources and evidenced by the decline of seagrass and hard clams and the increase of harmful algae, drift algae, and other noxious species, and studies show that increased development has caused pollutant loadings from nitrogen and phosphorus to grow; d.    In order to preserve the Barnegat Bay estuary watershed, help is urgently needed to protect the bay from pollution; and e.     It is therefore altogether fitting and proper for the State to create a special fund dedicated to protecting the Barnegat Bay estuary watershed, and support the fund by:  (1) dedicating a portion of sales tax revenues collected from the sale of fertilizer; (2) authorizing special license plates; and (3) soliciting and accepting donations, including at the time of application or renewal of a license to operate a personal watercraft or power vessel and registration or renewal of a vessel, and at the point of purchase of a beach tag or beach badge. 3.    a.  There is created in the Department of the Treasury a special non-lapsing fund to be known as the Barnegat Bay Protection Fund.  There shall be deposited in the fund: (1)   amounts collected from the retail sale of fertilizer pursuant to section 4 of P.L.    , c.   (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill;
