In addition to the above such other matters may be added, or such changes in the foregoing items may be made, as may from time to time be directed by the Director of the Division of Taxation.  The forms for filling out tables of aggregates shall be prescribed by the director and sent by him to the county treasurers of the several counties to be by them transmitted to the county board of taxation. Such table of aggregates shall be correctly added by columns and shall be signed by the members of the county board of taxation and shall within three days thereafter be transmitted to the county treasurer who shall file the same and forthwith cause it to be printed in its entirety and shall transmit certified copy of same to the Director of the Division of Taxation, the State Auditor, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs, the clerk of the board of freeholders, and the clerk of each municipality in the county. (cf: P.L.2018, c.94, s.10) 11.  (New section) The State Treasurer, in consultation with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, shall adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this act pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 12.  Sections 1 and 11 of P.L.2018, c.94 (C.54:1-105 and C.54:1-106) are repealed. 13.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would revise the current dates for the administration of the assessment of real property in order to create a more accurate process for that essential assessment function throughout the entire State.  The provisions of the bill specifically address the systemic costs which result from the losses due to successful assessment appeals by property owners, which reduce the property tax base, and which require municipalities to refund large amounts of property taxes collected from those property owners prior to the successful assessment appeal, which lowers their assessment, and thereby lowers the amount of property taxes due and payable from those property owners. Under current law, every municipal tax assessor files the municipalitys tax list with the county board of taxation, which subsequently sets the local tax rates.  Assessment appeals are filed by property owners on April 1 of each year, or on May 1 in the case of a municipality that has undergone a municipal-wide revaluation or reassessment of real property.  Appeals are heard by the county tax board and generally decided in most, if not all, cases by the end of July.  Successful appeals that late in the tax year result in reduced assessments, which results in a reduced municipal tax base, which then results in the under-collection of property taxes to fund current year operations.  The bill proposes the re-scheduling of the property assessment appeal process to dates prior to the calculation of the local property tax rate, which would allow for a more accurate local property tax rate to reflect local budgetary needs and the true value of the tax base that provides the property tax revenue to fund the local budget. The following chart sets forth the current statutory dates relative to the individual functions that comprise the real property assessment process, and the proposed dates for those functions under the bill: DATES RELATIVE TO CERTIFICATION OF THE TAX LIST, ASSESSMENT APPEALS, AND THE CALCULATION OF LOCAL TAX RATES IN ALL MUNICIPALITIES Description of Function Current Date Proposed Date Assessing Date October 1 of pre-tax year October 1 of pre-tax year Certification of Preliminary Assessment N/A November 1 of pre-tax year Notification of Assessment Postcards February 1 November 15 of pre-tax year Assessment Appeal Filing Deadline April 1; May 1 in municipalities wherein revaluation of real property has occurred January 15 Assessment Appeals Heard May, June and July February, March and April Tax List Filed January 10 May 5 County Preliminary Equalization March 10 May 15 County Final Equalization March 10 May 25 Municipal Budget to Tax Board March 31 May 15 County Budget to Tax Board April 1 May 15 School Budget to Tax Board May 19 May 15 Certified Tax Rates May 20 May 31 Tax Duplicates June 3 June 3 Tax Bills June 14 June 14 The assessment calendar proposed under this bill has been successfully implemented in Monmouth County since 2014, Gloucester County since 2018, and Burlington County since 2021. The calendar has been shown to provide municipalities in these counties with more financial certainty.  By notifying property owners of their property tax assessments and deciding appeals of those assessments at earlier times, municipalities can better ascertain their revenues to ensure the integrity of their budgets throughout the fiscal year.

STATEMENT This bill would revise the current dates for the administration of the assessment of real property in order to create a more accurate process for that essential assessment function throughout the entire State.  The provisions of the bill specifically address the systemic costs which result from the losses due to successful assessment appeals by property owners, which reduce the property tax base, and which require municipalities to refund large amounts of property taxes collected from those property owners prior to the successful assessment appeal, which lowers their assessment, and thereby lowers the amount of property taxes due and payable from those property owners. Under current law, every municipal tax assessor files the municipalitys tax list with the county board of taxation, which subsequently sets the local tax rates.  Assessment appeals are filed by property owners on April 1 of each year, or on May 1 in the case of a municipality that has undergone a municipal-wide revaluation or reassessment of real property.  Appeals are heard by the county tax board and generally decided in most, if not all, cases by the end of July.  Successful appeals that late in the tax year result in reduced assessments, which results in a reduced municipal tax base, which then results in the under-collection of property taxes to fund current year operations.  The bill proposes the re-scheduling of the property assessment appeal process to dates prior to the calculation of the local property tax rate, which would allow for a more accurate local property tax rate to reflect local budgetary needs and the true value of the tax base that provides the property tax revenue to fund the local budget. The following chart sets forth the current statutory dates relative to the individual functions that comprise the real property assessment process, and the proposed dates for those functions under the bill: DATES RELATIVE TO CERTIFICATION OF THE TAX LIST, ASSESSMENT APPEALS, AND THE CALCULATION OF LOCAL TAX RATES IN ALL MUNICIPALITIES Description of Function Current Date Proposed Date Assessing Date October 1 of pre-tax year October 1 of pre-tax year Certification of Preliminary Assessment N/A November 1 of pre-tax year Notification of Assessment Postcards February 1 November 15 of pre-tax year Assessment Appeal Filing Deadline April 1; May 1 in municipalities wherein revaluation of real property has occurred January 15 Assessment Appeals Heard May, June and July February, March and April Tax List Filed January 10 May 5 County Preliminary Equalization March 10 May 15 County Final Equalization March 10 May 25 Municipal Budget to Tax Board March 31 May 15 County Budget to Tax Board April 1 May 15 School Budget to Tax Board May 19 May 15 Certified Tax Rates May 20 May 31 Tax Duplicates June 3 June 3 Tax Bills June 14 June 14 The assessment calendar proposed under this bill has been successfully implemented in Monmouth County since 2014, Gloucester County since 2018, and Burlington County since 2021. The calendar has been shown to provide municipalities in these counties with more financial certainty.  By notifying property owners of their property tax assessments and deciding appeals of those assessments at earlier times, municipalities can better ascertain their revenues to ensure the integrity of their budgets throughout the fiscal year.
