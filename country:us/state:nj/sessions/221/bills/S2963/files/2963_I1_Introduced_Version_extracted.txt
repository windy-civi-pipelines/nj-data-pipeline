Upon suspension, the department shall contact the general contractor on any identifiable job sites where the suspended contractor was engaged in work.  That notification shall provide the general contractor 72 hours from the time of notification to remove the suspended contractor from the site.  If a general contractor continues to utilize a suspended contractor after receiving written notification from the department, then the general contractor shall be considered to be in violation of the act and subject to fines and penalties contained herein. 7.    The commissioner may adopt regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to carry out the purposes of this act. 8.    There is appropriated from the General Fund to the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, $2,000,000, to effectuate the provisions of this act. 9.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the sixth month next following enactment, except that the commissioner may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as may be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill establishes the New Jersey Private Contractor Registration Act.  The bill prohibits contractors and subcontractors from engaging in private construction work, unless they are registered pursuant to the bill. Under the bill, private construction work means all building or work on a building, structure, or improvement of any type, as well as related building or work on a building, done within the State under an express or implied contract on behalf of another entity or individual.  Private construction work does not include public work as that term is defined in the prevailing wage law, or home improvement, as that term is defined in the Contractors' Registration Act. As part of the registration, the contractor is required to include the following information: (1) the name, principal business address and telephone number of the private contractor; (2) whether the private contractor is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or other form of business entity; (3) if the private contractor's principal business address is not within the State, the name and address of the private contractor's custodian of records and agent for service of process in the State; (4) the name and address of each person with a financial interest in the private contractor and the percentage interest, except that if the private contractor is a publicly-traded corporation, the private contractor is required to supply the names and addresses of the corporation's officers; (5) the private contractor's tax identification number and unemployment insurance registration number; (6) a certification form provided by the commissioner, with documentation satisfactory to the commissioner, that the private contractor has all valid and effective licenses, registrations or certificates required by State law, including registrations or certifications required to do business in the State of New Jersey; (7) disclosure of any administrative merits determination, arbitral award or decision, or civil judgment, for violations of any of the certain federal and State labor laws or executive orders; and (8) any other relevant and appropriate information as determined by the commissioner. The bill requires a private contractor to pay an initial non-refundable registration fee of $750 to the commissioner.  Upon successful completion of an initial two year registration, a private contractor is thereafter required to register for a two-year period and pay a non-refundable registration fee of $500.  The bill provides that reduced fee schedules based upon an entitys annual revenue or non-profit status may be prescribed by regulation. The bill provides for penalties and fines for noncompliance with its provisions, including but not limited to the suspension of a contractors registration.  The bill appropriates from the General Fund to the Department of Labor and Workforce Development $2,000,000 to effectuate the provisions of the bill.

Upon suspension, the department shall contact the general contractor on any identifiable job sites where the suspended contractor was engaged in work.  That notification shall provide the general contractor 72 hours from the time of notification to remove the suspended contractor from the site.  If a general contractor continues to utilize a suspended contractor after receiving written notification from the department, then the general contractor shall be considered to be in violation of the act and subject to fines and penalties contained herein. 7.    The commissioner may adopt regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to carry out the purposes of this act. 8.    There is appropriated from the General Fund to the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, $2,000,000, to effectuate the provisions of this act. 9.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the sixth month next following enactment, except that the commissioner may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as may be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill establishes the New Jersey Private Contractor Registration Act.  The bill prohibits contractors and subcontractors from engaging in private construction work, unless they are registered pursuant to the bill. Under the bill, private construction work means all building or work on a building, structure, or improvement of any type, as well as related building or work on a building, done within the State under an express or implied contract on behalf of another entity or individual.  Private construction work does not include public work as that term is defined in the prevailing wage law, or home improvement, as that term is defined in the Contractors' Registration Act. As part of the registration, the contractor is required to include the following information: (1) the name, principal business address and telephone number of the private contractor; (2) whether the private contractor is a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or other form of business entity; (3) if the private contractor's principal business address is not within the State, the name and address of the private contractor's custodian of records and agent for service of process in the State; (4) the name and address of each person with a financial interest in the private contractor and the percentage interest, except that if the private contractor is a publicly-traded corporation, the private contractor is required to supply the names and addresses of the corporation's officers; (5) the private contractor's tax identification number and unemployment insurance registration number; (6) a certification form provided by the commissioner, with documentation satisfactory to the commissioner, that the private contractor has all valid and effective licenses, registrations or certificates required by State law, including registrations or certifications required to do business in the State of New Jersey; (7) disclosure of any administrative merits determination, arbitral award or decision, or civil judgment, for violations of any of the certain federal and State labor laws or executive orders; and (8) any other relevant and appropriate information as determined by the commissioner. The bill requires a private contractor to pay an initial non-refundable registration fee of $750 to the commissioner.  Upon successful completion of an initial two year registration, a private contractor is thereafter required to register for a two-year period and pay a non-refundable registration fee of $500.  The bill provides that reduced fee schedules based upon an entitys annual revenue or non-profit status may be prescribed by regulation. The bill provides for penalties and fines for noncompliance with its provisions, including but not limited to the suspension of a contractors registration.  The bill appropriates from the General Fund to the Department of Labor and Workforce Development $2,000,000 to effectuate the provisions of the bill.
