In the event that these rates, when used in accordance with the provisions of this section and assuming that each district's general fund levy is equal to its local share, do not result in equalization aid for all districts equal to the Statewide available equalization aid, the commissioner shall adjust these rates appropriately, giving equal weight to each. (cf: P.L.2007, c.260, s.10) 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall first apply to the first full school year following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill provides that a school districts nonpublic transportation costs are not to be included in the determination of the school districts local share for the purposes of calculating State school aid. Under the bill, a school districts prebudget year expenses for the transportation of nonpublic school students would be subtracted from the sum of the districts equalized property values and aggregate income to determine the districts local share.
