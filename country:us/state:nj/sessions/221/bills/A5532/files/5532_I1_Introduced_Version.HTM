<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10. a. It is a violation of
P.L.2023, c.10 (C.34:8D-1 et al.) for a temporary help service firm or third
party client, or any agent of a temporary help service firm or third party
client, to retaliate through discharge or in any other manner against any
temporary laborer in a designated classification placement for exercising any
rights granted under P.L.2023, c.10 (C.34:8D-1 et al.).  The termination or
disciplinary action by a temporary help service firm against a temporary
laborer in a designated classification placement within 90 days of the person's
exercise of rights protected under P.L.2023, c.10 (C.34:8D-1 et al.) shall
raise a rebuttable presumption of having done so in retaliation for the
exercise of those rights.  Such retaliation shall subject a temporary help
service firm or third party client, or both, to civil penalties pursuant to
P.L.2023, c.10 (C.34:8D-1 et al.) or a private cause of action.  <u>For
purposes of this section, the termination of a temporary assignment shall not
solely raise a presumption of retaliation.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    It is a violation of
P.L.2023, c.10 (C.34:8D-1 et al.) for a temporary help service firm or third
party client to retaliate against a temporary laborer in a designated
classification placement for:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) making a complaint to a
temporary help service firm, to a third party client, to a co-worker, to a
community organization, before a public hearing, or to a State or federal
agency that rights guaranteed under P.L.2023, c.10 (C.34:8D-1 et al.) have been
violated;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) instituting any proceeding
under or related to P.L.2023, c.10 (C.34:8D-1 et al.); or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) testifying or preparing to
testify in an investigation or proceeding under P.L.2023, c.10 (C.34:8D-1 et
al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     When the commissioner
finds that a temporary help service firm or third party client has violated
this section, the commissioner is authorized to assess and collect
administrative penalties, up to a maximum of $250 for a first violation and up
to a maximum of $500 for each subsequent violation, specified in a schedule of
penalties to be promulgated as a rule or regulation by the commissioner in
accordance with the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410
(C.52:14B-1 et seq.).  When determining the amount of the penalty imposed
because of a violation, the commissioner shall consider factors which include
the history of previous violations by the employer, the seriousness of the
violation, the good faith of the employer and the size of the employer's
business.  No administrative penalty shall be levied pursuant to this section
unless the commissioner provides the alleged violator with notification of the
violation and of the amount of the penalty by certified mail and an opportunity
to request a hearing before the commissioner or his designee within 15 days
following the receipt of the notice.  If a hearing is requested, the
commissioner shall issue a final order upon such hearing and a finding that a
violation has occurred.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a
final order upon expiration of the 15-day period.  Payment of the penalty is
due when a final order is issued or when the notice becomes a final order.  Any
penalty imposed pursuant to this section may be recovered with costs in a
summary proceeding commenced by the commissioner pursuant to &quot;the penalty
enforcement law&quot; (N.J.S. 2A:58-1 et seq.).  Any sum collected as a fine or
penalty pursuant to this section shall be applied toward enforcement and
administration costs of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
Business Growth Protection Act and revises the law concerning temporary help
service firms and temporary laborers.  The bill limits its applicability to
temporary laborers working in the State.  Under current law, New Jersey
residents who are temporary laborers working outside the State are covered,
which was causing third party clients in other states to reduce their use of
temporary laborers from New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill changes what
information is required to be provided in itemized statements by temporary help
service firms to temporary laborers from a daily commission rate to the option
of calculating hours worked, for itemized statements and placement fee
calculation, based on total hours worked during a weekly or other pay period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill protects proprietary
information of temporary help service firms by providing that the firms do not
have an obligation to disclose pay rates to third party clients or third party
client bill rates to temporary laborers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill revises the law to
change the pay equity provision from equal pay and benefits to just equal pay. 
The bill provides that equal pay means temporary help service firms are
required to pay temporary laborers a wage not less than the clients current
entry level pay rate for client employees with the minimum qualifications for
the position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill revises the surety
bond requirement for temporary help service firms.  Specifically, the bill
reduces the bond requirement from not less than $200,000 to a minimum of
$50,000 and a cap of $200,000, depending on the revenue of the temporary help
service firm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill changes the
rebuttable presumption of retaliation under the law with respect to termination
of an assignment.  The bill provides that no presumption of retaliation will be
raised based solely on the termination of a scheduled temporary assignment.</p>
