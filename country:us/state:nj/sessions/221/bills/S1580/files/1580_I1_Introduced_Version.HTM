<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:
150%'>     1.    a.  The Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   New Jersey has been a
hub for pharmaceutical, technology, medical research, and other science-related
businesses for over a century;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   with the reestablishment
of the New Jersey Commission on Science, Innovation, and Technology
(commission), the State is refocusing its efforts on attracting and fostering
emerging technology business innovators so that New Jersey can continue to lead
the nation in the fields of science and technology; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the Innovation
Partnership shall work in tandem with the commission to fund these innovators
and to ensure they have the support to continue with their work in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Legislature further
finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Beatrice Hicks, born in
Orange, New Jersey in 1919, was one this States most successful and important
scientists and engineers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   by the age of 13, after
being inspired by the newly built Empire State Building and George Washington
Bridge, Ms. Hicks believed her calling was to become an engineer;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   a graduate of Orange
High School and the Newark College of Engineering, now known as the New Jersey
Institute of Technology, Ms. Hicks went on to be the first woman engineer
employed by Western Electric, where she pioneered the theoretical study,
analysis, development, and manufacture of sensing devices, developed
long-distance telephone technology, and a invented a crystal oscillator that generated
radio frequencies used in aircraft communications;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   after working as an
independent consultant, she assumed several leadership roles at her fathers
company, the Newark Controls Company;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Ms. Hicks served as
vice-president and chief engineer, and eventually president, of the Newark
Controls Company, where she developed environmental sensors for heating and
cooling systems that went on to be used in the United States space program;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Ms. Hicks co-founded the
Society of Women Engineers in 1950 after recognizing the lack of support and
encouragement women received to pursue an education in engineering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Legislature
therefore determines that, in honor of her trailblazing and independent spirit,
her innovations and leadership in science and engineering, and her
consciousness of the support needed to foster a community of innovators, this
partnership shall be established.</p>
