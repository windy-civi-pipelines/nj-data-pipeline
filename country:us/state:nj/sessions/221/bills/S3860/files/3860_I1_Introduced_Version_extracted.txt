STATEMENT This bill requires school district capital project referendums to be voted on only during the June primary elections and the November general elections.  Under current law, a school district capital project referendum may take place during an annual or special school election.  An annual school election may be held in April or November, and a special election may be held on the fourth Tuesday in January, the second Tuesday in March, the last Tuesday in September, or the second Tuesday in December.  This bill will mandate that school district capital project referendums may only be held during the June primary elections or the November general elections, during an already occurring special election being held for another purpose, or during a municipal election held regularly outside of the June primary election and November general election, when that election includes all of the legal voters of the school district.  The bill also requires the Secretary of State to coordinate with the county clerk of each county on how the school district capital project referendum questions are to be displayed on a June primary election ballot.
