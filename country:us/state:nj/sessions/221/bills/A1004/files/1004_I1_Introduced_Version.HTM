not on the defendants intent, paragraph (3) does not give a defendant
sufficient guidance or notice on how to conform to the law. The court found
that paragraph (3) unconstitutionally allows a defendant to be convicted of a
bias crime even though a jury may conclude that the defendant had no intent to
commit such a crime.   </p>
