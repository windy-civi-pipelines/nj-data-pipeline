<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In January of 2018, the Legislature
enacted P.L.2017, c.291 that established certain requirements in the event that
a school district, educational services commission, or an approved private
school for students with disabilities choose to utilize physical restraint or a
seclusion technique on a student with disabilities.  This bill amends that law
to provide that in addition to the requirements previously imposed when
physical restraint or seclusion techniques are used on a student with
disabilities, the school district, educational services commission, or the
approved private school for students with disabilities are also required to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)  request a meeting with the
parent or guardian of the student who has been subjected to physical restraint
or seclusion on more than one occasion to discuss a plan for improving the
students behavior;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)  in the case of seclusion,
to immediately notify the students parent or guardian when the student is
subject to seclusion by telephone or electronic communication.  Under the
current law, this requirement is only applicable to the use of physical
restraint; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)  provide a full written
report of the incident of seclusion to the students parent or guardian within
48 hours of the occurrence of the incident.  Again, under current law, this
requirement is only applicable to the use of physical restraint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
Department of Education to establish guidelines on adequate physical
requirements for a seclusion area, including guidelines on the lighting and
space of the seclusion area.  The guidelines are to ensure the safety and
dignity of the student placed in the seclusion area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also directs the
department to annually collect data from school districts, educational services
commissions, and approved private schools for students with disabilities on the
use of physical restraint and seclusion.  The department is to annually publish
the data on its website disaggregated by county and by race, gender, and age.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that the requirements included in current law and in the bill on the use of
physical restraint and seclusion on students with disabilities, will also be
applied to the use of physical restraint and seclusion on all other students.</p>
