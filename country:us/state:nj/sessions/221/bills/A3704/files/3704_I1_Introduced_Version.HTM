In the first full year where an existing appropriation or expenditure that is subject to budget limitations is made an exception to budget limitations, a county shall deduct from its final appropriations upon which its permissible expenditures are calculated pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1976, c.68 (C.40A:4-45.2) the amount which the county expended for that purpose during the last full budget year, or portion thereof, in which the purpose so excepted was funded from appropriations in the county budget. In the first full year where an existing appropriation or expenditure that is not subject to budget limitations is made subject to budget limitations, a county shall add to its final appropriations upon which its permissible expenditures are calculated pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1976, c.68 (C.40A:4-45.2) the amount which the county expended for that purpose during the last full budget year, or portion thereof, in which the purpose so excepted was funded from appropriations in the county budget. (cf:  P.L.2007, c.311, s.18) 2.    Section 10 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.40A:4-45.45) is amended to read as follows: 10.  a.  (1)  [In] Except as provided in section 4 of P.L.1976, c.68 (C.40A:4-45.4), in the preparation of its budget the amount to be raised by taxation by a local unit shall not exceed, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the sum of new ratables, the adjusted tax levy, and the total of waivers approved pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.40A:4-45.46); provided, however, that in the case of a county, the amount to be raised by taxation shall not exceed the [amount] greater of the two amounts permitted by this section and section 4 of P.L.1976, c.68 (C.40A:4-45.4). (2)   A local unit that has not been granted approval for a waiver pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.40A:4-45.46), may add to its adjusted tax levy in any one of the next three succeeding years, the amount of the difference between the maximum allowable amount to be raised by taxation or county purposes tax, as applicable, for the current local budget year pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and the actual amount to be raised by taxation or county purposes tax, as applicable, for the current local budget year. b.    The following exclusions shall be added to the calculation of the adjusted tax levy: increases in amounts required to be raised by taxation for capital expenditures, including debt service as defined by law; increases in pension contributions and accrued liability for pension contributions in excess of 2.0%; increases in health care costs equal to that portion of the actual increase in total health care costs for the budget year that is in excess of 2.0% of the total health care costs in the prior year, but is not in excess of the product of the total health care costs in the prior year and the average percentage increase of the State Health Benefits Program, P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.), as annually determined by the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury; and extraordinary costs incurred by a local unit directly related to a declared emergency, as defined by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, in consultation with the Commissioner of Education, as appropriate. If there are no exclusions, then the amount of the difference shall reduce the adjusted tax levy by that amount.  Any cancelled or unexpended appropriation for any exclusion pursuant to this subsection or waiver pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.40A:4-45.46), also shall be deducted from the sum of the exclusions listed in this subsection or directly reduce the adjusted tax levy if there are no exclusions. (cf:  P.L.2010, c.44, s.9) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall be retroactive to January 1, 2024. STATEMENT This bill modifies the process for calculating the county property tax levy. Under current law, counties are required to calculate the annual property tax levy using two different statutory formulas.  One formula for calculating the property tax levy is established pursuant to N.J.S.40A:4-45.4 and another formulas is established pursuant to N.J.S.40A:4-45.45.  The calculations performed using these two formulas generally result in the two different county property tax levy amounts. In this circumstance, current law provides that the maximum permitted county tax levy may not exceed the lower of those two calculations.  This bill revises this provision of law and instead provides that a countys maximum permitted property tax levy may not exceed the greater of these two calculations.
