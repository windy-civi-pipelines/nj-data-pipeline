large commercial, residential and small commercial customers, as those
customers are classified or defined by the board, that generate electricity, on
the customer's side of the meter, using a Class I renewable energy source, for
the net amount of electricity supplied by the electric power supplier or basic
generation service provider over an annualized period.  Systems of any sized
capacity, as measured in watts, are eligible for net metering.  If the amount
of electricity generated by the customer-generator, plus any kilowatt hour
credits held over from the previous billing periods, exceeds the electricity
supplied by the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider,
then the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider, as the
case may be, shall credit the customer-generator for the excess kilowatt hours
until the end of the annualized period at which point the customer-generator
will be compensated for any remaining credits or, if the customer-generator
chooses, credit the customer-generator on a real-time basis, at the electric
power supplier's or basic generation service provider's avoided cost of
wholesale power or the PJM electric power pool's real-time locational marginal
pricing rate, adjusted for losses, for the respective zone in the PJM electric
power pool.  Alternatively, the customer-generator may execute a bilateral
agreement with an electric power supplier or basic generation service provider
for the sale and purchase of the customer-generator's excess generation.  The
customer-generator may be credited on a real-time basis, so long as the
customer-generator follows applicable rules prescribed by the PJM electric
power pool for its capacity requirements for the net amount of electricity
supplied by the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider. 
The board may authorize an electric power supplier or basic generation service
provider to cease offering net metering to customers that are not already net metered
whenever the total rated generating capacity owned and operated by net metering
customer-generators Statewide equals 5.8 percent of the total annual
kilowatt-hours sold in this State by each electric power supplier and each
basic generation service provider during the prior one-year period;</p>

State entity, school district, county, county agency, county authority,
municipality, municipal agency, or municipal authority.  The standards shall
provide that, in order to qualify for net metering aggregation, the customer
must operate a solar electric power generation system using a net metering
billing account, which system is located on property owned by the customer,

agricultural or horticultural use and that is valued, assessed, and taxed

planning board of a municipality in which a solar electric power generation
system is located may waive the requirement of this subparagraph (a), (b) the
system is not an on-site generation facility, (c) all of the facilities of the
single customer combined for the purpose of net metering aggregation are
facilities owned or operated by the single customer and are located within its
territorial jurisdiction except that all of the facilities of a State entity
engaged in net metering aggregation shall be located within five miles of one
another, and (d) all of those facilities are within the service territory of a
single electric public utility and are all served by the same basic generation
service provider or by the same electric power supplier.  The standards shall
provide that, in order to qualify for net metering aggregation, the customer's
solar electric power generation system shall be sized so that its annual
generation does not exceed the combined metered annual energy usage of the
qualified customer facilities, and the qualified customer facilities shall all
be in the same customer rate class under the applicable electric public utility
tariff.  For the customer's facility or property on which the solar electric
generation system is installed, the electricity generated from the customer's
solar electric generation system shall be accounted for pursuant to the
provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection to provide that the electricity
generated in excess of the electricity supplied by the electric power supplier
or the basic generation service provider, as the case may be, for the
customer's facility on which the solar electric generation system is installed,
over the annualized period, is credited at the electric power supplier's or the
basic generation service provider's avoided cost of wholesale power or the PJM
electric power pool real-time locational marginal pricing rate.  All
electricity used by the customer's qualified facilities, with the exception of
the facility or property on which the solar electric power generation system is
installed, shall be billed at the full retail rate pursuant to the electric
public utility tariff applicable to the customer class of the customer using
the electricity.  A customer may contract with a third party to operate a solar
electric power generation system, for the purpose of net metering aggregation. 
Any contractual relationship entered into for operation of a solar electric
power generation system related to net metering aggregation shall include
contractual protections that provide for adequate performance and provision for
construction and operation for the term of the contract, including any
appropriate bonding or escrow requirements.  Any incremental cost to an
electric public utility for net metering aggregation shall be fully and timely
recovered in a manner to be determined by the board.  The board shall adopt net
metering aggregation standards within 270 days after the effective date of
P.L.2012, c.24. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would revise the
State's renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS), the provisions in law that
require each electric power supplier and basic generation service provider to
sell a certain percentage of electricity from renewable energy sources each
year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
provide that, beginning in 2030, the RPS for Class I renewable energy (Class I
RPS) would apply to the total electricity sold in the State after subtracting
the amount of electricity generated by existing nuclear power plants and
&quot;zero-carbon&quot; electricity sources that begin operation after 2030. 
The bill would define a &quot;zero-carbon electric generating facility&quot; as
&quot;any electric power generation facility that does not emit carbon dioxide
as a by-product of combusting fuel to generate electricity.&quot;  The bill
would also require that, beginning in 2030, at least 50 percent of the renewable
energy certificates (RECs) used by an entity to satisfy the Class I RPS be
generated in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also extend the
Class I RPS to require that, beginning in 2045, 100 percent of the energy sold
at retail in the State be from Class I renewable energy sources.  The bill
would also provide that the current RPS for Class II renewable energy, which
requires that 2.5 percent of energy sold at retail be from Class II renewable
energy sources, would expire in 2045.  Finally, the bill would clarify that the
Class I RPS may be satisfied by purchasing and retiring RECs.</p>
