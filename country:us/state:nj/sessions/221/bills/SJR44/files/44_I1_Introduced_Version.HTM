STATEMENT This resolution designates the Monday of Manufacturing Week as Women in Manufacturing Day.  This day recognizes the historical and modern contributions of women to the manufacturing industry in the State of New Jersey. Throughout history, women have played a crucial role in the manufacturing industry.  Since the Industrial Revolution, women have made up a significant portion of the workforce, contributing as laborers, leaders, and innovators.  Women like Tabitha Babbitt, Margaret Knight, and Stephanie Kwolek revolutionized the manufacturing industry with their inventions, paving the way for increased productivity and better safety measures. Women continue to play an important role in the manufacturing industry.  Manufacturing is crucial to New Jerseys economy and women constitute a substantial portion of the workforce in both labor and leadership positions. New Jersey is the third highest state for percentage of women working in the manufacturing industry and is among the states with the largest number of women working in key manufacturing fields like pharmaceuticals and textiles.  The women who work in New Jerseys manufacturing industry are a vital part of its success. Women are an essential part of any plan to grow the manufacturing industry.  Gender diversity in a business is proven to result in an improved ability to innovate and increases profitability, and as such helps any company to expand and evolve.  One of the key components to recruiting more women to the field of manufacturing is encouraging women from a younger age, and the celebration of womens contributions to the field would capture the interest of girls and young women.
