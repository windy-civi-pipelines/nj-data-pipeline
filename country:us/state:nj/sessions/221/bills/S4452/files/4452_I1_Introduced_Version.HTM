Tax Act,&quot; N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., in an amount, except as is otherwise
provided in paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subsection, that shall be equal to
the amount by which the reasonable development costs of the qualified project,
as approved by the agency exceed the amount to be paid by a qualified homeowner
in an affordable sale.  In addition to the other limitations established by
this subsection:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the tax credit shall not
exceed 35 percent of the lesser of: (a) the reasonable development costs, or
(b) 80 percent of the median sales price for a new home in the State, as
determined by the agency; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  the agency shall adopt

residence that is owned by a qualified homeowner.  This tax credit shall not
exceed the amount by which the reasonable development costs of the substantial
rehabilitation exceed the increase in the assessed value of the qualified
residence that results from the substantial rehabilitation.  The rules and
regulations of the agency may allow the tax credit to the qualified homeowner
directly in the case of a substantial rehabilitation if the household income of
the qualified homeowner is no greater than 100 percent of the median household
income of the metropolitan statistical area of the individuals principal

Director of the agency.  The amount of the credit applied pursuant to this
section against the tax imposed for a taxable year, together with any other
credits allowed by law, shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less
than zero.  The amount of unused credit allowable pursuant to this section may
be carried forward, if necessary, to the seven taxable years following the taxable
year for which the tax credit is allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  A business entity that is
classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes shall not be
allowed the credit directly, but the amount of credit of a taxpayer in respect
of a distributive share of partnership income shall be determined by allocating
to the taxpayer that proportion of the credit acquired by the partnership that
is equal to the taxpayers share, whether or not distributed, of the total
distributive income or gain of the partnership for its taxable year ending
within or with the taxpayers taxable year.  A taxpayer that is a New Jersey S
corporation shall not be allowed the credit directly, but the amount of credit
of a taxpayer in respect of a pro rata share of S corporation income shall be
determined by allocating to the taxpayer that proportion of the credit acquired
by the New Jersey S corporation that is equal to the taxpayers share, whether
or not distributed, of the total pro-rata share of S corporation income of the
New Jersey S corporation for its privilege period ending within or with the
taxpayers taxable year. </p>

developments.  This bill is intended to complement the federal Low Income
Housing Tax Credit program, which supports affordable rental housing, but is
not designed to facilitate the construction or rehabilitation of owner-occupied
homes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=HangingAnActChar>     The
bill would authorize a project sponsor, who is financing the </span>construction
or substantial renovation of one or more qualified residences, to obtain a
credit against taxes otherwise due under the gross income tax.  The tax credit
would be in an amount equaling the amount by which the reasonable development
costs of the qualified project exceed the amount to be paid by a qualified
homeowner in an affordable sale.  However, the bill also prohibits the tax
credit from exceeding 35 percent of the lesser of the total reasonable
development costs, or 80 percent of the median sales price for a new home in
the State.  Further, the bill also directs the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage
Finance Agency (HMFA) to adopt rules and regulations to establish an
alternative calculation of the tax credit amount to be permitted for a
substantial rehabilitation of a home already owned by a qualified homeowner.  In
this circumstance, the credit is not to exceed the amount by which the
reasonable development costs of the substantial rehabilitation exceed the
increase in the assessed value of the home that results from the substantial
rehabilitation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a qualified
project consists of either: (1) the substantial rehabilitation of a qualified
residence that is owned by a qualified homeowner, as defined in the bill; or

does not exceed the median household income of the county, by household size,
multiplied by three.  Under the bill, an eligible purchaser or qualified
homeowner is required to have a household income of 140 percent, or less, of
the median household income for the State.</p>

residing in the home, the bill requires the homeowner to pay HMFA a penalty of
between 10 percent and 50 percent of the amount by which the price that the
qualified homeowner sold the home for exceeds the initial affordable sales
