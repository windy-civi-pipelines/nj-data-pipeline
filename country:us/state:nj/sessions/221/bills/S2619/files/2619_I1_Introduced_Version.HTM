TURNER District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS Requires State agencies to vacate certain property in Trenton; allows EDA to offer incentives to private entities to locate to that property. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the vacating of State offices on certain property and certain Economic Development Authority programs and supplementing P.L.1974, c.180 (C.34:1B-1 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Any State department or agency with offices located at 300 Riverview Plaza, Trenton, or 400 Riverview Plaza, Trenton, shall relocate its offices from 300 Riverview Plaza, Trenton, and 400 Riverview Plaza, Trenton, to new locations within the city of Trenton as expeditiously as is reasonably possible.  Upon the effective date of this act, the department or agency shall pursue all legal and reasonable means available to terminate the leases for the Riverview properties, and shall cooperate with the landlord of each property to fill any space that becomes vacant as a result of the lease termination and relocation with new tenants as quickly as possible. The new location of a department or agency shall be suitable to the needs of the department or agency.  Relocation from a building shall occur upon conclusion of an agreement to terminate the lease for that building with the landlord of that building. 2.  a.  The New Jersey Economic Development Authority shall take an active role in the redevelopment of the Delaware River waterfront of the city of Trenton, which shall include, but not be limited to, seeking to attract private entities to occupy any office space vacated or to be vacated by a State agency pursuant to section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    The authority shall give priority consideration for eligibility of any authority-administered business assistance program to a private entity seeking to occupy any office space vacated or to be vacated by a State agency pursuant to section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     The authority, with the approval of the State Treasurer, shall modify its existing business assistance programs, where permissible by law, to give bonuses or other enhanced incentives to a private entity that locates to an office space vacated or to be vacated by a State agency pursuant to section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Business assistance programs that may be modified may include, but are not limited to, the Grow New Jersey Assistance Program established pursuant to P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-242 et seq.) and the Economic Redevelopment and Growth Grant Program established pursuant to P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-489a et al.). d.    The authority is authorized to request assistance from any department, authority, commission, board, office, division, or agency of the State to provide any information, resources, or other assistance deemed necessary to discharge their responsibilities under P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including, but not be limited to: the Department of Treasury for assistance with business funding assistance programs; the Department of Labor and Workforce Development for assistance in developing workforce development strategies; the Department of Transportation and the New Jersey Transit Corporation for assistance in enhancing public transportation networks and infrastructure; the Department of State to assist in business attraction efforts and advising on smart growth development strategies; and the Department of Community Affairs for assistance in expanding housing opportunities and the coordination with the Urban Enterprise Zone program. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require State departments and agencies with offices located at the Riverview Plaza in the city of Trenton to relocate to other suitable locations within the city of Trenton. Currently, the Department of Education maintains offices at Riverview Plaza. Riverview Plaza is centrally located with access to both the Delaware river and Route 29.  Significant business and recreational attractions could develop there.  Relocation of State departments and agencies from Riverview Plaza will enhance the redevelopment potential of this prime real estate. Additionally, this bill would require the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) to take an active role in the redevelopment of the Delaware river waterfront of the city of Trenton.  The bill specifically requires EDA to seek to attract private entities to occupy office space at Riverview Plaza buildings which will be vacated by the State pursuant to this bill. The bill requires EDA to give priority consideration for eligibility of any EDA-administered business assistance program to a private entity seeking to occupy office space vacated by the State pursuant to the bill.  The bill authorizes EDA to modify its business assistance programs, where permissible by law, to give bonuses or other enhanced incentives to private entities that occupy this office space.  The bill also authorizes EDA to seek assistance from other State entities that it deems necessary to discharge its responsibilities under this bill.
