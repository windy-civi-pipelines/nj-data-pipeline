STATEMENT This bill revises the price threshold for a new luxury passenger automobile under New Jersey's Luxury and Fuel-Inefficient Vehicle Surcharge (LFIS).  Under current law, the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) imposes a one-time 0.4 percent LFIS when a new passenger automobile with a sales or lease price of at least $45,000 or with a fuel efficiency rating of less than 19 miles per gallon is issued a certificate of ownership.  This bill increases this threshold to $70,000 and further requires the Director of the Division of Taxation (director) to adjust the fee based on the New Vehicles category percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), as published by the United States Department of Labor, for the three-year period ending on June 30 of the preceding year.  The adjusted fee is then to be added to the sales or lease price and rounded to the nearest whole dollar.  Finally, the bill requires the director to publish the adjusted fee amount on the divisions Internet website by no later than December 1 of the year preceding the implementation of the adjusted fee.
