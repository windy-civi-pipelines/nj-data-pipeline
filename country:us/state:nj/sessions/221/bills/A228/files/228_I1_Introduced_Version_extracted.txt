A228 ASSEMBLY, No. 228 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  MICHAEL INGANAMORT District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) Assemblywoman  DAWN FANTASIA District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) SYNOPSIS Permits idling of motor vehicles on residential property. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the idling of motor vehicles and supplementing P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, no person shall be prevented from or penalized for causing, suffering, allowing, or permitting the engine of a gasoline-fueled motor vehicle to idle on residential property. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would allow a person to idle a gasoline-fueled motor vehicle on residential property. Idling is a common method of warming up a motor vehicle before driving.  The current Department of Environmental Protection regulation concerning motor vehicle idling, N.J.A.C.7:27-15.8, prevents a person from idling a gasoline-fueled motor vehicle for more than three minutes under most circumstances.  While the regulation provides seven exemptions from this prohibition, there is no exemption for warming up a car on residential property.  This bill would prevent a person from being penalized for warming up a motor vehicle on residential property.
