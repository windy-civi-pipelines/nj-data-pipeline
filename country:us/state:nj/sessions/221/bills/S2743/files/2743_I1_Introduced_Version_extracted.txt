In addition, the bill establishes the Inpatient Drug Rehabilitation Assistance Fund.  Five percent of the proceeds from property that is forfeited from a drug-related offense because of information provided by an informant will be deposited into the fund. The fund is to be used to provide treatment at a licensed residential drug treatment program to New Jersey citizens who cannot afford treatment.  Eligibility and assistance from the fund will be determined by the Commissioner of Human Services.
