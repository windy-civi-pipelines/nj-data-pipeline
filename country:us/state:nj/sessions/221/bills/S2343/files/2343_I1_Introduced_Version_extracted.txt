(cf: P.L.2018, c.45, s.2) 3.    Section 5 of P.L.1996, c.60 (C.54A:3A-19) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a. If a taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction for property taxes under section 3 of this act for a part of the taxable year is also eligible for a deduction for rent constituting property taxes under section 4 of this act for a part of the taxable year, the taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction, not in excess of [$15,000] $25,000, subject to the limitations of subsection b. of this section, the amount of which shall be equal to the sum of the amount of property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6) plus the amount of property taxes due and paid for the calendar year in which the property taxes are due and payable on a homestead that is not a unit of residential rental property and the amount of rent constituting property taxes due and paid for the calendar year in which the rent constituting property taxes is due and payable for the occupancy of a homestead that is a unit of residential rental property, provided however, that the amount of property taxes and property tax credits shall be subject to the limitations set forth in subsections b. through e. of section 3 and the amount of rent constituting property taxes shall be subject to the limitations set forth in subsections b. and c. of section 4 as may be applicable. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section to the contrary: (1) a taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction for property taxes under section 3 of this act for a part of the taxable year and is also eligible for a deduction for rent constituting property taxes under section 4 of this act for a part of the taxable year, shall be allowed a deduction for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning during 1996 based on 50% of an amount not in excess of $5,000, the amount of which shall be equal to the sum of the amount of property taxes paid on a homestead that is not a unit of residential rental property and the amount of rent constituting property taxes paid for the occupancy of a homestead that is a unit of residential rental property; and (2) a taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction for property taxes under section 3 of this act for a part of the taxable year and is also eligible for a deduction for rent constituting property taxes under section 4 of this act for a part of the taxable year, shall be allowed a deduction for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning during 1997 based on 75% of an amount not in excess of $7,500, the amount of which shall be equal to the sum of the amount of property taxes paid on a homestead that is not a unit of residential rental property and the amount of rent constituting property taxes paid for the occupancy of a homestead that is a unit of residential rental property. (cf: P.L.2018, c.45, s.3) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases the maximum gross income tax deduction allowed for homestead property taxes paid. Currently, a resident taxpayer is allowed a deduction from gross income for property taxes paid for the calendar year on the taxpayers principal residence in the State, up to a maximum deduction of $15,000.  Similarly, a resident taxpayer that rents or leases a unit of residential property that is the taxpayers principal residence is allowed to deduct from gross income 18% of the rent paid for occupancy during the taxable year, up to a maximum deduction of $15,000 for rent constituting property taxes.  Current law also provides that a taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction for property taxes paid for part of the year, and also eligible for a deduction for rent constituting property taxes paid for part of the year is allowed to deduct the sum of the property taxes paid and the rent constituting property taxes paid, subject to certain limitations, up to a maximum deduction of $15,000. This bill raises the amount of the maximum deduction from gross income allowed for homestead property taxes paid in each of the three provisions to $25,000 in recognition of the reality that property taxes and rents have become an ever-increasing burden on New Jersey families.
