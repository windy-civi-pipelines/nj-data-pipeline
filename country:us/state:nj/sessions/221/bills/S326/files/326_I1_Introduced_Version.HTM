The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires pharmaceutical companies to place a black box warning on a drug label if medical studies indicate that the drug carries a significant risk of serious or life-threatening adverse effects.  A black box warning is the strongest warning that the FDA requires. A physician, physician assistant, advanced practice nurse, or other authorized prescriber who violates the requirements established under the bill is subject to disciplinary action by the applicable State professional licensing board.
