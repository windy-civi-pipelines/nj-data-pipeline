credit transfer certificate allowed under this section shall not be exchanged for consideration received by the taxpayer of less than 75 percent of the transferred tax credit amount.  Any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate used by a purchaser or assignee against a tax liability under P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) shall be subject to the same limitations and conditions that apply to the use of a tax credit pursuant to subsection c. of this section.  Any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate obtained by a purchaser or assignee under subsection a. or subsection b. of this

agreements with the authority detailing obligations of the awardee and outcomes relating to events of default, including, but not limited to, recapture, forfeiture, and termination.  Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection or other law to the contrary, if a film production company designated as a New Jersey studio partner ceases to qualify for its designation as a New Jersey film studio partner and becomes designated as a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, the authority shall reduce the cumulative total amount of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, made available to New Jersey studio partners in each fiscal year and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey film-lease production companies in each fiscal year by a corresponding amount pursuant to a formula established in rules adopted by the authority which shall consider the volume of applications submitted by New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities, the cumulative total amount of tax credits allowed to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities in the prior fiscal year, the total square footage of facility space occupied in the State by New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities, and any other factors that the authority deems appropriate.  Award agreements between the authority and New Jersey studio partners shall include a requirement for each New Jersey studio partner to occupy the

conditions for designation as a New Jersey studio partner, the authority shall recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayer's designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for which the authority has not approved final documentation, shall terminate.  The authority shall

If the cumulative total amount of tax credits, and tax credit transfer certificates, allowed to taxpayers for privilege periods or taxable years commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection a. of this section and subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b) exceeds the amount of tax credits available in that fiscal year, then taxpayers who have first applied for and have not been allowed a tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate amount for that reason shall have their applications approved by the authority, provided the application otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section, and shall be allowed the amount of tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate on the first day of the next succeeding fiscal year in which tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates under subsection a. of this section and subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b) are not in excess of the amount of credits available. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved to New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved to each such category, in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval to each such category in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining for each such category from the prior fiscal year. The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved for each such category, but not subject to redemption or transfer.

Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining from the prior fiscal year.  The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved, but not subject to redemption or transfer. f.     A taxpayer shall submit to the authority and the director a report prepared by an independent certified public accountant licensed in this State to verify the taxpayer's tax credit claim following the completion of the production.  A New Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report prepared by an independent certified public accountant, pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, no later than two years after the date on which the production concludes.  The deferred compensation payments shall constitute qualified film production expenses as if the expenses were incurred at the time of production, provided there are credits available and subject to the authority's review.  The report shall be prepared by the independent certified public accountant pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, and shall include such information and documentation as shall be determined to be necessary by the authority and the director to substantiate the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  A single report with attachments deemed necessary by the authority shall be submitted electronically.  Upon receipt of the report, the authority and the director shall review the findings of the independent certified public accountant's report, and shall make a determination as to the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  The authority's and the director's review shall include, but shall not be limited to: a review of all non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items over $20,000; a review of 100 randomly selected non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items that are greater than $2,500, but less than $20,000; a review of 100 randomly selected non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items that are less than $2,500; a review of the qualified wages for the 15 employees, independent contractors, or loan-out companies with the highest qualified wages;

Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining from the prior fiscal year.  The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved, but not subject to redemption or transfer. g.    A taxpayer shall submit to the authority and the director a report prepared by an independent certified public accountant licensed in this State to verify the taxpayer's tax credit claim following the completion of the production.  A New Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report prepared by an independent certified public accountant, pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, no later than two years after the date on which the production concludes.  The deferred compensation payments shall constitute qualified film production expenses as if the expenses were incurred at the time of production, provided there are credits available and subject to the authority's review.  The report shall be prepared by the independent certified public accountant pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, and shall include such information and documentation as shall be determined to be necessary by the authority and the director to substantiate the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  A single report with attachments deemed necessary by the authority shall be submitted electronically.  Upon receipt of the report, the authority and the director shall review the findings of the independent certified public accountant's report, and shall make a determination as to the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  The authority's and the director's review shall include, but shall not be limited to: a review of all non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items over $20,000;
