section) As used in sections 3 through 5 of act: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     Division
means the</span> Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in the
Department of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Laboratory means the same as
that term is defined at <span style='color:black'>42 CFR s.493.2.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Financial hardship <span
style='color:black'>means a substantial inability to meet basic living expenses
due to a lack of sufficient financial resources demonstrated by: (i) gross
household income which does not exceed 200 percent of the federal poverty
level, or is otherwise insufficient to cover necessary costs of housing, food,
utilities, transportation, and medical expenses; or (ii) exceptional and
unforeseen expenses that substantially impair a patients financial stability</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     NJ FamilyCare <span
style='color:black'>means the program established pursuant to P.L.2005, c.156
(C.30:4J-8 et al.), which includes the Medicaid Program and the Childrens Health
Insurance Program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black'>3.    (New
Section) The Legislature finds and declares that:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black'>a.     There
is growing concern across the State that the current basis for reimbursement
for laboratory services under NJ FamilyCare has the effect of impeding access
to care for uninsured, underinsured, underserved, or otherwise vulnerable
recipients of those services.  As laboratories play a critical role in
providing urine toxicology testing for patients who suffer from substance use
disorders, it is essential that the Legislature address the negative
consequences of this existing policy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     b.    Currently,
pursuant to N.J.A.C.10:61-1.7, charges submitted to NJ Family Care for
laboratory services  are required to reflect  the service providers lowest
professional charge, and under no circumstances is the charge to exceed the
provider's charge for identical services to other groups or individuals.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     c.     Under
this policy, when a laboratory charges an uninsured patient, that patients
treating provider, or another requester of laboratory testing a lower price for
a drug screen than the amount charged to NJ FamilyCare, the laboratory must
reduce its charges under NJ FamilyCare with respect to all contemporaneous and
future claims for that test, notwithstanding that the NJ FamilyCare fee
schedule provides for a higher reimbursement amount for such test.  All amounts
received by the laboratory from NJ FamilyCare in excess of the discounted rate,
dating back to the first instance  in which the laboratory accepted the
discounted rate, is considered a violation of current regulations and an
overpayment by NJ FamilyCare to the laboratory. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     d.    Notably,
the current NJ FamilyCare reimbursement policy requires a laboratory to avail
NJ FamilyCare of the same pricing the laboratory offers to all patients,
including those who are uninsured, underinsured, underserved, or otherwise facing
financial hardships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     e.     A
laboratory in violation the current NJ FamilyCare reimbursement policy would additionally
be non-compliant with the States existing anti-rebate regulation as, pursuant
to N.J.A.C.10:61-2.4, a discount to a patient, that patients treating provider,
or another requester of laboratory testing is considered a rebate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     f.     A
proliferation of recent enforcement activity regarding violations of the
current NJ FamilyCare reimbursement policy and anti-rebate regulation focused
on laboratory services provided to uninsured, underinsured, and underserved
patients raises serious concern that laboratories will cease offering
discounted charges to vulnerable patients.  The populations in jeopardy of
losing access to critical services include patients who are: homeless;
experiencing financial hardship; in extreme poverty; wholly uninsured; awaiting
determination of Medicaid enrollment; required to complete testing to access certain
levels of care at substance use disorder treatment facilities; involved in the
New Jersey Drug Court program; newly released inmates who must comply with
court-ordered testing; clinically diagnosed with substance use disorders and
who require routine drug testing within a Division of Mental Health and
Addiction Services licensed facility; and required to receive laboratory
services in connection with a legal mandate, with a State-funded program, or

additionally be non-compliant with the existing anti-rebate regulation as,
