fiscal year thereafter until the fund has been credited with a cumulative total of $5,000,000.  If in any fiscal year after being credited with a cumulative total of $5,000,000 the balance in the fund declines to less than $2,000,000, the board shall, one time only, transfer a supplementary $3,000,000 into the fund. 3.    (New section)  There is hereby established a "Solar Roof Installation Warranty Program" within the authority, which shall be administered pursuant to the provisions of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The purpose of the program is to provide a source of indemnification to owners of commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings located in the State damaged as a result of the installation of solar photovoltaic equipment on their building roofs. 4.    (New section)  a.  To implement the program, the authority shall establish, administer, and maintain a "Solar Roof Installation Warranty Fund" in a trust account, separate and apart from other funds.  The authority shall consult with the Department of Banking and Insurance and the Board of Public Utilities prior to establishing the fund.  The fund shall be credited with the amount required to be transferred thereto pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The purpose of the fund is: (1) to provide moneys sufficient to pay claims by commercial, industrial, and institutional building owners participating in the fund for damages to building roofs due to the installation or design of solar photovoltaic equipment on building roofs that are not covered by any other roof warranty or insurance; and (2) to pay the costs of administering the solar roof installation warranty program established in the authority pursuant to section 3 of P.L.   , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including the costs of obtaining sufficient reinsurance to prudently protect the fund against unanticipated risks and costs incurred by the authority in the discharge of its duties. b.    Applications for participation in the warranty program shall be submitted by commercial, industrial, and institutional building owners at the time of installation of such solar photovoltaic equipment on the roof of a building located in the State in a form and manner determined by the authority.  The applicant shall demonstrate to the authority that the solar photovoltaic equipment installer does not offer a comprehensive warranty of at least 20 years duration on the roofs upon which the equipment is installed and that the installation of such equipment is not covered by any other insurance policy.  The application shall include a payment of an application fee of $1,000.  The amounts paid to participating building owners shall be established by the authority and may be changed from time to time and shall be calculated to assure that the fund balance is sufficient to cover anticipated claims, to provide a reasonable reserve, and to cover the costs of administering the fund, provided however, that the maximum amount to be paid from the fund for a loss to a participant for any one building shall be $50,000.  The application fee paid by commercial, industrial, and institutional building owners shall be forwarded to the authority and shall be accounted for and credited to the fund. c.     The authority shall hold, manage, and through the Division of Investment in the Department of the Treasury, invest and reinvest moneys in the fund and credit all income earned thereon to the fund in the same manner as provided by law for the investment of pension and retirement funds administered by the State.  The authority shall keep the State Treasurer advised of anticipated cash demands for payment of claims against the fund.  No funds shall be spent, appropriated, or transferred from the fund other than for the express purposes of paying claims or costs related to administering the fund as specified in subsections a. and b. of this section.  The Joint Budget Oversight Committee, or its successor, shall have the authority to investigate complaints of violative fund transfers under this section, and shall order the authority to suspend paying claims if it determines that the provisions of this subsection have been violated. d.    Prior to making a claim against the fund for damages covered by the warranty, a building owner shall notify the installer of such defects and allow a reasonable time period for repair.  If the repairs are not made within a reasonable time or are not satisfactory to the building owner, the building owner may file a claim against the fund in the form and manner prescribed by the authority.  The authority shall investigate each claim to determine the validity thereof, and upon a finding that the building owner is without fault with respect to the damage for which the claim is made, the authority shall determine the amount of the award that shall be made thereon.  If a claim is denied or the amount of the award is contested, the authority shall hold a hearing if requested by the building owner, in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), applicable to contested cases.  Provided there are sufficient moneys in the fund to cover anticipated claims, the amount of the award shall cover the reasonable costs necessary to indemnify the building owner for the cost of repairing any damages to the roof that are covered under the warranty program, but the total amount of an award from the fund shall not exceed the maximum award established in subsection b. of this section or the cost of those repairs, whichever is less.  Upon certification from the authority of the amount of an award, the authority shall make payment to the building owner from the fund. e.     If the authority determines that fund reserves and reinsurance may be insufficient to cover anticipated claims, the authority shall restore fund resources to sufficiency by means that may include, in addition to any supplementary transfer made pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), increases in fees, expanded reinsurance, and changes in standards and claims adjudication procedures. f.     The authority may provide for surcharges against those building owners who are responsible for a significant number of awards against the fund and may discontinue the participation in the fund of any building owner who is responsible for an excessive number of awards against the fund after a hearing in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c. 410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), applicable to contested cases.  At no time shall the State be required to contribute any moneys to the fund, nor shall the State or the authority have any liability to any person having any right to or claim against the fund over and above the amount therein except in those instances where it is determined by the Joint Budget Oversight Committee that the provisions of subsection c. of this section have been violated concerning amounts spent, appropriated or transferred from the fund. 5.    This act shall take effect on the 60th day after the date of enactment, but the New Jersey Economic Development Authority may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill establishes a "Solar Roof Installation Warranty Program" (program) within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA).  The purpose of the program is to provide a source of indemnification to commercial, industrial, and institutional building owners who install solar photovoltaic equipment on their building roofs, but are unable to obtain sufficient warranty coverage against damage to those roofs resulting from the installations. To implement the program, the bill requires the EDA to establish a "Solar Roof Installation Warranty Fund" (warranty fund) in a trust account in consultation with the Department of Banking and Insurance and the Board of Public Utilities (BPU). The purpose of the warranty fund is to: 1) provide sufficient money to pay claims by commercial, industrial, and institutional building owners, who are participating in the warranty fund, for damages to building roofs due to the installation or design of solar photovoltaic equipment that are not covered by a warranty or insurance policy; and 2) pay the costs of administering the solar roof installation warranty program, including the costs of obtaining sufficient reinsurance to prudently protect the warranty fund against unanticipated risks and costs incurred by the EDA in the discharge of its duties. The bill requires applications for participation in the program to be submitted by building owners at the time of installation of solar photovoltaic equipment on the roof of a building located in the State, in a form and manner determined by the EDA.  The applicant must demonstrate that the solar photovoltaic equipment installer does not offer a comprehensive 20-year warranty on the roofs upon which the equipment is installed and that the installation of the equipment is not covered by any other warranty or insurance policy.  The application fee is to be $1,000.  The maximum amount to be paid from the warranty fund for a loss to a participant for any one building is to be $50,000.  The application fee paid by building owners is to be forwarded to the EDA to be accounted for and credited to the warranty fund. The bill provides that, prior to making a claim against the warranty fund for damages covered by the warranty, a building owner must notify the installer of the damage and allow a reasonable time period for repair.  If repairs are not made within a reasonable time or are not satisfactory to the building owner, the building owner may file a claim against the warranty fund in the form and manner prescribed by the EDA. The bill requires the EDA to investigate each claim to determine its validity, and upon a finding that the building owner is without fault with respect to the damage for which the claim is made, determine the amount of the award.  If a claim is denied or the amount of the award is contested, the building owner may request a hearing.  If an award is made from the warranty fund, the total amount of an award is not to exceed the maximum amount authorized in the bill or the cost of repairs, whichever is less.  The EDA may provide for surcharges against building owners who are responsible for a significant number of awards against the warranty fund and may discontinue the participation in the warranty fund of any building owner who is responsible for an excessive number of awards against the warranty fund, after a hearing. The bill directs the BPU to transfer, in the fiscal year commencing July 1 next following the date of enactment, $2,000,000 from available balances accumulated in accounts of the BPU from funds collected through the societal benefits charge, for deposit into the warranty fund.  The bill requires the BPU to make additional deposits of $500,000 each fiscal year thereafter until the warranty fund has been credited with a cumulative total of $5,000,000. The bill provides that, if in any fiscal year thereafter the balance in the warranty fund falls below $2,000,000, the BPU is to make a one-time deposit of $3,000,000 into the warranty fund.

Warranty Program" within the authority, which shall be administered pursuant to the provisions of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The purpose of the program is to provide a source of indemnification to owners of commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings located in the State damaged as a result of the installation of solar photovoltaic equipment on their building roofs. 4.    (New section)  a.  To implement the program, the authority shall establish, administer, and maintain a "Solar Roof Installation Warranty Fund" in a trust account, separate and apart from other funds.  The authority shall consult with the Department of Banking and Insurance and the Board of Public Utilities prior to establishing the fund.  The fund shall be credited with the amount required to be transferred thereto pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The purpose of the fund is: (1) to provide moneys sufficient to pay claims by commercial, industrial, and institutional building owners participating in the fund for damages to building roofs due to the installation or design of solar photovoltaic equipment on building roofs that are not covered by any other roof warranty or insurance; and (2) to pay the costs of administering the solar roof installation warranty program established in the authority pursuant to section 3 of P.L.   , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including the costs of obtaining sufficient reinsurance to prudently protect the fund against unanticipated risks and costs incurred by the authority in the discharge of its duties. b.    Applications for participation in the warranty program shall be submitted by commercial, industrial, and institutional building owners at the time of installation of such solar photovoltaic equipment on the roof of a building located in the State in a form and manner determined by the authority.  The applicant shall demonstrate to the authority that the solar photovoltaic equipment installer does not offer a comprehensive warranty of at least 20 years duration on the roofs upon which the equipment is installed and that the installation of such equipment is not covered by any other insurance policy.  The application shall include a payment of an application fee of $1,000.  The amounts paid to participating building owners shall be established by the authority and may be changed from time to time and shall be calculated to assure that the fund balance is sufficient to cover anticipated claims, to provide a reasonable reserve, and to cover the costs of administering the fund, provided however, that the maximum amount to be paid from the fund for a loss to a participant for any one building shall be $50,000.  The application fee paid by commercial, industrial, and institutional building owners shall be forwarded to the authority and shall be accounted for and credited to the fund. c.     The authority shall hold, manage, and through the Division of Investment in the Department of the Treasury, invest and reinvest moneys in the fund and credit all income earned thereon to the fund in the same manner as provided by law for the investment of pension and retirement funds administered by the State.  The authority shall keep the State Treasurer advised of anticipated cash demands for payment of claims against the fund.  No funds shall be spent, appropriated, or transferred from the fund other than for the express purposes of paying claims or costs related to administering the fund as specified in subsections a. and b. of this section.  The Joint Budget Oversight Committee, or its successor, shall have the authority to investigate complaints of violative fund transfers under this section, and shall order the authority to suspend paying claims if it determines that the provisions of this subsection have been violated. d.    Prior to making a claim against the fund for damages covered by the warranty, a building owner shall notify the installer of such defects and allow a reasonable time period for repair.  If the repairs are not made within a reasonable time or are not satisfactory to the building owner, the building owner may file a claim against the fund in the form and manner prescribed by the authority.  The authority shall investigate each claim to determine the validity thereof, and upon a finding that the building owner is without fault with respect to the damage for which the claim is made, the authority shall determine the amount of the award that shall be made thereon.  If a claim is denied or the amount of the award is contested, the authority shall hold a hearing if requested by the building owner, in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), applicable to contested cases.  Provided there are sufficient moneys in the fund to cover anticipated claims, the amount of the award shall cover the reasonable costs necessary to indemnify the building owner for the cost of repairing any damages to the roof that are covered under the warranty program, but the total amount of an award from the fund shall not exceed the maximum award established in subsection b. of this section or the cost of those repairs, whichever is less.  Upon certification from the authority of the amount of an award, the authority shall make payment to the building owner from the fund. e.     If the authority determines that fund reserves and reinsurance may be insufficient to cover anticipated claims, the authority shall restore fund resources to sufficiency by means that may include, in addition to any supplementary transfer made pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), increases in fees, expanded reinsurance, and changes in standards and claims adjudication procedures. f.     The authority may provide for surcharges against those building owners who are responsible for a significant number of awards against the fund and may discontinue the participation in the fund of any building owner who is responsible for an excessive number of awards against the fund after a hearing in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c. 410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), applicable to contested cases.  At no time shall the State be required to contribute any moneys to the fund, nor shall the State or the authority have any liability to any person having any right to or claim against the fund over and above the amount therein except in those instances where it is determined by the Joint Budget Oversight Committee that the provisions of subsection c. of this section have been violated concerning amounts spent, appropriated or transferred from the fund. 5.    This act shall take effect on the 60th day after the date of enactment, but the New Jersey Economic Development Authority may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill establishes a "Solar Roof Installation Warranty Program" (program) within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA).  The purpose of the program is to provide a source of indemnification to commercial, industrial, and institutional building owners who install solar photovoltaic equipment on their building roofs, but are unable to obtain sufficient warranty coverage against damage to those roofs resulting from the installations. To implement the program, the bill requires the EDA to establish a "Solar Roof Installation Warranty Fund" (warranty fund) in a trust account in consultation with the Department of Banking and Insurance and the Board of Public Utilities (BPU). The purpose of the warranty fund is to: 1) provide sufficient money to pay claims by commercial, industrial, and institutional building owners, who are participating in the warranty fund, for damages to building roofs due to the installation or design of solar photovoltaic equipment that are not covered by a warranty or insurance policy; and 2) pay the costs of administering the solar roof installation warranty program, including the costs of obtaining sufficient reinsurance to prudently protect the warranty fund against unanticipated risks and costs incurred by the EDA in the discharge of its duties. The bill requires applications for participation in the program to be submitted by building owners at the time of installation of solar photovoltaic equipment on the roof of a building located in the State, in a form and manner determined by the EDA.  The applicant must demonstrate that the solar photovoltaic equipment installer does not offer a comprehensive 20-year warranty on the roofs upon which the equipment is installed and that the installation of the equipment is not covered by any other warranty or insurance policy.  The application fee is to be $1,000.  The maximum amount to be paid from the warranty fund for a loss to a participant for any one building is to be $50,000.  The application fee paid by building owners is to be forwarded to the EDA to be accounted for and credited to the warranty fund. The bill provides that, prior to making a claim against the warranty fund for damages covered by the warranty, a building owner must notify the installer of the damage and allow a reasonable time period for repair.  If repairs are not made within a reasonable time or are not satisfactory to the building owner, the building owner may file a claim against the warranty fund in the form and manner prescribed by the EDA. The bill requires the EDA to investigate each claim to determine its validity, and upon a finding that the building owner is without fault with respect to the damage for which the claim is made, determine the amount of the award.  If a claim is denied or the amount of the award is contested, the building owner may request a hearing.  If an award is made from the warranty fund, the total amount of an award is not to exceed the maximum amount authorized in the bill or the cost of repairs, whichever is less.  The EDA may provide for surcharges against building owners who are responsible for a significant number of awards against the warranty fund and may discontinue the participation in the warranty fund of any building owner who is responsible for an excessive number of awards against the warranty fund, after a hearing. The bill directs the BPU to transfer, in the fiscal year commencing July 1 next following the date of enactment, $2,000,000 from available balances accumulated in accounts of the BPU from funds collected through the societal benefits charge, for deposit into the warranty fund.  The bill requires the BPU to make additional deposits of $500,000 each fiscal year thereafter until the warranty fund has been credited with a cumulative total of $5,000,000. The bill provides that, if in any fiscal year thereafter the balance in the warranty fund falls below $2,000,000, the BPU is to make a one-time deposit of $3,000,000 into the warranty fund.
