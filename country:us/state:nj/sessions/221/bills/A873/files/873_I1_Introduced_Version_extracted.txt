Member municipalities of the NJUMA display a disproportionate need for youth sports and educational programs. This bill would provide these municipalities, and the youth populations of the municipalities, with access to funding to improve, create, and support youth programs and facilities. Ensuring funding for the purposes described under the bill would represent a meaningful investment in the educational and social-emotional development of children in the eligible municipalities and provide them with stimulating after school and summer safe havens.
