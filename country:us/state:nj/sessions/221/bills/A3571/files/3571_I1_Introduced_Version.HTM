<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  a. 
Notwithstanding any law or regulation to the contrary, the Department of Health
shall maintain an adequate emergency stockpile of insulin as shall be necessary
to meet the emergency needs of persons in New Jersey whose insulin supply has
or will run out before the persons next prescription may be filled.  At a
minimum, the emergency stockpile shall include the 10 most common brands and
types of insulin used by New Jersey residents.  The Commissioner of Health
shall collaborate with the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance to determining
which brands and types of insulin are most commonly used in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In determining the
quantity of insulin the department will need to maintain in order to meet the
requirements of this section, the department shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   take into account
prevailing conditions in the State that may affect the need for and
availability of insulin;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   take into account
anticipated surges, over the next 90 days, in the need for emergency supplies
of insulin; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   take into consideration
the current state of the supply chain of insulin in the State, including, but
not limited to, unit cost, recent price increases, overall availability, and
delays in shipping times; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   utilize any other tool
as the department may designate for use in determining the anticipated need for
emergency insulin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Department of
Health shall reevaluate the adequacy of its emergency stockpile of insulin at
least quarterly, and shall acquire such additional supplies of insulin, and
such additional brands and types of insulin, as it determines are necessary to
meet the need for emergency insulin in New Jersey. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1)  The Department of
Health shall develop a program under which the department will furnish
emergency insulin, at cost, to any person whose insulin supply has or will run
out before the persons next prescription may be filled.  Subject to the
provisions of paragraph (3) of this subsection, the department may seek
reimbursement for emergency insulin dispensed by the department from the
persons health benefits plan, if any, or accept cash payment from the person. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Except as provided in
paragraph (3) of this subsection, a person shall not obtain more than one
emergency 30-day supply of insulin from the department, or from a pharmacist
pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill), in a 12-month period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Notwithstanding the
provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the department may furnish
additional emergency supplies of insulin to a person based on demonstrated
need; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a
persons health benefits plan carrier, if any, to provide coverage for more
than one emergency 30-day supply of insulin in a 12-month period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The department may
establish standards and procedures to verify whether a persons insulin supply
has or will run out before the persons next prescription may be filled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The department shall
develop a sourcing protocol to acquire insulin for its emergency stockpile that
maximizes the cost effectiveness of the program and secures the best available
consumer price for each insulin product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The department shall
report each emergency 30-day supply of insulin furnished pursuant to subsection
d. of this section to the prescription monitoring database maintained pursuant
to P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-44 et al.) and shall, prior to furnishing an
emergency 30-day supply of insulin, review the persons prescription monitoring
information to determine whether the person was furnished an emergency 30-day
supply of insulin by the department or dispensed an emergency 30-day supply of
insulin by a pharmacy within the preceding 12 months.  To the extent possible,
the information reported by the department concerning an emergency 30-day
supply of insulin furnished by the department shall include the information
required under subsection b. of section 25 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-45). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  a.
Notwithstanding any other law or regulation to the contrary, a pharmacist may,
no more than once every 12 months, dispense an emergency 30-day supply of
insulin to a person whose insulin supply has or will run out before the
persons next prescription may be filled, which emergency supply of insulin may
be dispensed pursuant to a standing order issued by a prescriber or pursuant to
the standing order issued pursuant to subsection b. of this section, provided
that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the pharmacist has a
record of a previous prescription for insulin for that person, which
prescription was dispensed within the past year;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the pharmacist is unable
to obtain authorization for an additional supply of insulin from an authorized
prescriber; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the amount of insulin
dispensed in the 30-day supply does not exceed the amount that was dispensed
under the most recent prescription for insulin dispensed by the pharmacy to
that person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Commissioner of
Health, or, if the commissioner is not a duly licensed physician, the Deputy
Commissioner for Public Health Services, shall issue a standing order
authorizing all licensed pharmacists in the State to dispense emergency 30-day
supplies of insulin pursuant to subsection a. of this section.  The
Commissioner of Health shall provide a copy of the standing order to the Board
of Pharmacy, which shall post a copy of the standing order on the board's
Internet website and transmit a copy of the standing order to all licensed
pharmacists in such a manner as the board deems appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes
requirements for patients to access emergency supplies of insulin and provides
for insurance coverage of emergency insulin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
requires the Department of Health (DOH) to maintain an adequate emergency
stockpile of insulin as is necessary to meet the emergency needs of people in
New Jersey whose insulin supply has or will run out before the persons next prescription
may be filled.  At a minimum, the emergency stockpile is include the 10 most
common brands and types of insulin used by New Jersey residents.  The DOH will
be required to collaborate with the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance to
determine which brands and types of insulin are most commonly used in New
Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In determining the quantity of
insulin the DOH will need to maintain under the bill, the DOH will be required
to take into account prevailing conditions in the State that may affect the
need for and availability of insulin; take into account anticipated surges,
over the next 90 days, in the need for emergency supplies of insulin; take into
consideration the current state of the supply chain of insulin in the State,
including, but not limited to, unit cost, recent price increases, overall
availability, and delays in shipping times; and utilize any other tool as the
DOH designates for use in determining the anticipated need for emergency
insulin.  The DOH will be required to reevaluate the adequacy of its emergency stockpile
of insulin at least quarterly and acquire such additional supplies of insulin,
and such additional brands and types of insulin, as it determines are necessary
to meet the need for emergency insulin in New Jersey. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The DOH will be required to
develop a sourcing protocol to acquire insulin for its emergency stockpile that
maximizes the cost effectiveness of the program and secures the best available
consumer price for each insulin product.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The DOH will be required to develop
a program under which the DOH will furnish emergency insulin, at cost, to
individuals whose insulin supply has or will run out before the persons next
prescription may be filled.  The DOH will be authorized to seek reimbursement
for the emergency insulin from the persons health benefits plan, if any, or
accept cash payment from the person.  The department may establish standards
and procedures to verify whether a persons insulin supply has or will run out
before the persons next prescription may be filled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill additionally
authorizes pharmacists to dispense an emergency 30-day supply of insulin once
every 12 months, which emergency supply of insulin may be dispensed pursuant to
a standing order issued by a prescriber or pursuant to the standing order
issued by the DOH under the bill.  In order to dispense emergency insulin to a
person under the bill, the pharmacist will need to:  have a record of a
previous prescription for insulin for that person, which prescription was
dispensed within the past year; have been unable to obtain authorization for an
additional supply of insulin from an authorized prescriber; and ensure the
amount of insulin dispensed in the emergency 30-day supply does not exceed the
amount that was dispensed under the most recent prescription for insulin
dispensed by the pharmacy to that person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Commissioner of Health,
or, if the commissioner is not a duly licensed physician, the Deputy
Commissioner for Public Health Services, will be required to issue a standing
order authorizing all licensed pharmacists in the State to dispense emergency
insulin under the bill.  The Commissioner of Health is to provide a copy of the
standing order to the Board of Pharmacy, which will post a copy of the standing
order on the board's Internet website and transmit a copy of the standing order
to all licensed pharmacists in such a manner as the board deems appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In general, individuals may
not receive more than one emergency 30-day supply of insulin in a given
12-month period, regardless of whether the emergency insulin was dispensed by
the DOH or a pharmacist.  However, the bill authorizes the DOH to furnish
additional emergency supplies of insulin to a person based on demonstrated
need.  The bill specifies that additional emergency supplies dispensed by the
DOH over an emergency 30-day supply will not be subject to the insurance
coverage requirements of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The DOH and pharmacists will
be required to report each emergency 30-day supply of insulin dispensed under
the bill to the prescription monitoring database maintained pursuant to
P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-44 et al.) and will be required, prior to dispensing an
emergency 30-day supply of insulin, to review the persons prescription
monitoring information to determine whether the person was dispensed an
emergency 30-day supply of insulin by the DOH or by a pharmacy in the preceding
12 months.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires health
insurers, Medicaid, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School
Employees Health Benefits Program to provide coverage for emergency 30-day
supplies of insulin dispensed under the bill at least once every 12 months. 
The coverage requirement includes the <span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:
150%'>health benefits plan of a hospital, medical or health service
corporation, individual, small employer, large group commercial insurer, and
health maintenance organization.</span> </p>
