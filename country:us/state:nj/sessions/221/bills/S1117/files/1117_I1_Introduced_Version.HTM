<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Compliance period&quot;
means a 12-month period of time during which a warehouse operator covered under
the provisions of this act is required to implement an air pollution reduction
and mitigation plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Department&quot; means
the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Partial zero-emission
vehicle&quot; means a vehicle certified as a partial zero-emission vehicle
pursuant to the California Air Resources Board vehicle standards for the
applicable model year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Warehouse&quot; means a
building that stores cargo, goods, or products on a short- or long-term basis
for later distribution to businesses or retail customers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Warehouse operator&quot;
means an entity that conducts day-to-day operations at a warehouse, including
operations conducted through the use of third-party contractors, which entity may
or may not be the owner of the warehouse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Zero-emission
vehicle&quot; means a vehicle certified as a zero-emission vehicle pursuant to
the California Air Resources Board zero-emission vehicle standards for the
applicable model year but shall not include a partial zero-emission vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  No later than 24
months after the effective date of this act, the department shall develop,
pursuant to the provisions of this act, a program to reduce and mitigate air
pollution created by warehouse operations in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Beginning 36 months after
the effective date of this act, a warehouse operator that utilizes more than
50,000 square feet for its operations in a warehouse greater than 100,000
square feet in size shall not operate in the State unless it implements the
standard air pollution reduction and mitigation plan developed by the
department pursuant to section 3 of this act or a custom air pollution
reduction and mitigation plan developed pursuant to section 4 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  A warehouse operator may
comply with the provisions of this act by implementing a standard air pollution
reduction and mitigation plan, provided that the plan has been approved by the
department pursuant to section 5 of this act.  The department shall develop, as
part of the rules and regulations adopted to implement this act, a template for
the standard air pollution reduction and mitigation plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  The standard air pollution
reduction and mitigation plan shall require warehouse operators to accrue a
number of air pollution reduction and mitigation points during a compliance
period, using a formula established in the rules and regulations adopted to
implement this act.  The number of required points shall be proportional to the
amount of semi-tractor-trailer truck traffic that originates from the warehouse
operations during the previous compliance period, which shall be calculated
using a formula developed by the department pursuant to paragraph (2) of
subsection a. of section 6 of this act.  The department shall, during the first
four years of the program established pursuant to subsection a. of section 2 of
this act, multiply the number of required points by a factor between zero and
one, which factor may vary according to warehouse operator size.  Beginning on
the fifth year of the program and thereafter, this factor shall equal one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Under the standard air
pollution reduction and mitigation plan, a warehouse operator may be awarded
air pollution reduction and mitigation points only for the following activities
completed during the compliance period:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  purchase of a
zero-emission vehicle or partial zero-emission vehicle for use in the warehouse
operator's semi-tractor-trailer truck fleet or as a vehicle used solely to
perform warehouse operations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  delivery of a load of
cargo to, or the pick up of a load of cargo from, a warehouse using a semi-tractor-trailer
truck that is a zero-emission vehicle or partial zero-emission vehicle;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  use of a vehicle that is
a zero-emission vehicle or partial zero-emission vehicle to perform warehouse
operations for one hour; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  installation of a
charging or fueling station for zero-emission vehicles to support a warehouse's
operations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  use of a charging or
fueling station to charge or fuel a zero-emission vehicle that is used solely
to perform warehouse operations, or that is in the warehouse operator's semi-tractor-trailer
truck fleet;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  installation of a solar
electric power generation system on the premises of a warehouse used by the
warehouse operator;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)  generation of one
kilowatt-hour of electric power using a solar electric power generation system
installed on the premises of a warehouse used by the warehouse operator;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)  installation of an air
filtration system capable of removing automobile exhaust from the air at a
school, daycare, hospital, community center, or other appropriate building, as
determined by the department, which building is located in the same municipality
as a warehouse used by the warehouse operator;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)  replacement of a filter
in an air filtration system capable of removing automobile exhaust from the air
at a school, daycare, hospital, community center, or other appropriate
building, as determined by the department, which building is located in the
same municipality as a warehouse used by the warehouse operator; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  provision of an
alternative compliance payment of $1,000 for deposit into the Plug-in Electric
Vehicle Incentive Fund established pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2019, c.362 (C.48:25-7).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The department shall develop a
weighting system for the points given for activities listed in paragraphs (1)
through (10) of this subsection.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the

have the authority to assess penalties prior to the establishment of rules and
regulations governing penalties to the extent that such penalties are
reasonable and based on other violations of a similar type, seriousness, and
duration.  No civil administrative penalty shall be imposed until after the
person has been notified by certified mail or personal service.  The notice
shall include: a reference to the section of the act, rule, regulation, order,
or permit violated; a concise statement of the facts alleged to constitute a
violation; a statement of the amount of the civil administrative penalties to

order or civil administrative penalty after imposing the amount of the fine
specified in the notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a
final order or a final civil administrative penalty upon the expiration of the
20-day period.  Payment of the penalty is due when a final order is issued or
when the notice becomes a final order or a final civil administrative penalty. 
The authority to levy a civil administrative penalty is in addition to all
other enforcement provisions in this act, and the payment of a civil
administrative penalty shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any
other enforcement provision in connection with the violation for which the
penalty is levied.  A civil administrative penalty imposed under this
subsection may be compromised by the commissioner upon the posting of a performance
bond by the violator, or upon terms and conditions the commissioner may
establish by rule or regulation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require
certain warehouse operators to implement an air pollution reduction and
mitigation plan (APRM plan), beginning 36 months after the bill's effective
date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
apply to warehouse operators that utilize at least 50,000 square feet of
warehouse space in at least one warehouse that is at least 100,000 square feet
in size.  The bill defines a &quot;warehouse operator&quot; as an entity that
conducts day-to-day operations at a warehouse, including operations conducted
through the use of third-party contractors, which entity may or may not be the owner
of the warehouse.  The bill would prohibit applicable warehouse operators from
conducting warehousing operations in New Jersey, unless they implement an APRM
plan approved by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would direct the DEP
to develop, no later than 24 months after the bill's effective date, a template
for the standard APRM plan.  In order to implement the standard plan, warehouse
operators would first need to determine the amount of truck traffic that
originates from their operations using a formula to be developed by the DEP, as
well as the square footage of warehouse space they utilize.  Then, warehouse
operators would use those figures in another formula, also to be developed by
the DEP, to determine the number of air pollution reduction and mitigation
points (APRM points) they need to accrue during the following year.  Warehouse
operators would be able to accrue APRM points through various activities 
including purchasing low- or zero-emissions vehicles, installing solar panels,
or installing air filters at certain buildings in the municipalities in which
they operate  as enumerated in subsection b. of section 3 of the bill.  APRM
points could also be accrued by depositing moneys in the Plug-in Electric
Vehicle Incentive Fund established pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2019, c.362 (C.48:25-7).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Warehouse operators may also
comply with the bill's provisions by submitting a custom APRM plan to the DEP. 
The custom APRM would be required to state the actions to be taken by the
warehouse operator to reduce or mitigate air pollution caused by the warehouse
operator, as well as conform to other minimum standards established in
subsection b. of section 4 of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require
warehouse operators to submit to the DEP each year the APRM plan to be
implemented for the next year and an annual report detailing the actions taken
during the previous year.  The DEP would have 90 days to approve, conditionally
approve, or disapprove the plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also require
warehouse operators to retain records that demonstrate whether and how they
have complied with the bill's provisions.  In particular, warehouse operators
would be required to retain records that evidence the amount of truck traffic
generated by the warehouse operator.  The bill would require the DEP to develop
guidelines to assist warehouse operators with this task.  The bill would
authorize the DEP to request the records retained by warehouse operators, as
well as to audit warehouse operators, for cause or randomly.  The bill would
direct the DEP to publish the warehouse operators covered under the bill and
their compliance status on its website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person who violates the
provisions of the bill would be subject to a civil administrative penalty of up
to $25,000 for each violation.  The amount of any civil administrative penalty
would be assessed pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the DEP for
violations of similar type, seriousness, and duration.  A person who violates
the provisions of the bill, and any order issues pursuant thereto, or who fails
to pay in full a civil administrative penalty, would be subject, upon order of
a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000.  Civil penalties would be
imposed and recovered in a summary proceeding pursuant to the Penalty
Enforcement Law of 1999.  In addition to these penalties, a person who
knowingly, purposely, or recklessly makes a false or misleading statement to
the DEP on any certification or registration would be guilty of a crime of the
third degree and subject to a fine of up to $50,000 and restitution.  The bill also
establishes other remedies and enforcement mechanisms.</p>
