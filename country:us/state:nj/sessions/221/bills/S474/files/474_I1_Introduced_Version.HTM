c.79 (C.40A:12A-14) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     14.  a.  A delineated area may
be determined to be in need of rehabilitation if the governing body of the
municipality determines by resolution that a program of rehabilitation, as
defined in section 3 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-3), may be expected to
prevent further deterioration and promote the overall development of the community;
and that there exist in that area any of the following conditions such that (1)
a significant portion of structures therein are in a deteriorated or
substandard condition; (2) more than half of the housing stock in the
delineated area is at least 50 years old; (3) there is a pattern of vacancy,
abandonment or underutilization of properties in the area; (4) there is a
persistent arrearage of property tax payments on properties in the area; (5)
environmental contamination is discouraging improvements and investment in
properties in the area; or (6) a majority of the water and sewer infrastructure
in the delineated area is at least 50 years old and is in need of repair or
substantial maintenance.  Where warranted by consideration of the overall
conditions and requirements of the community, a finding of need for
rehabilitation may extend to the entire area of a municipality.  Prior to
adoption of the resolution, the governing body shall submit it to the municipal
planning board for its review. Within 45 days of its receipt of the proposed
resolution, the municipal planning board shall submit its recommendations
regarding the proposed resolution, including any modifications which it may
recommend, to the governing body for its consideration.  Thereafter, or after
the expiration of the 45 days if the municipal planning board does not submit
recommendations, the governing body may adopt the resolution, with or without
modification.  The resolution shall not become effective without the approval
of the commissioner pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-6), if
otherwise required pursuant to that section.</p>

of the household's home on the same lot by either a charitable entity organized
to perform home renovations or by a for-profit builder using 75% or more
volunteer labor-hours to accomplish the construction for the project.  The
undertaking may include any buildings; demolition, clearance, or removal of
buildings from land; equipment; facilities; or other personal properties or

the dwelling as their primary residence qualify for a federal income tax credit
pursuant to 26 U.S.C. s.22 as a result of being permanently and totally

created by the elevation of those dwellings as not increasing the taxable value
of those properties for a period of five years, notwithstanding that the market
