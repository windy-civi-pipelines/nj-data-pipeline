and (8) the total amount of estimated greenhouse gas reduction or avoidance to be achieved is reasonable considering the State's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals established by the "Global Warming Response Act," P.L.2007, c.112 (C.26:2C-37 et al.), customer cost, and the total amount of greenhouse gas reduction or avoidance achieved under the gas public utility's previously approved plans, if applicable. d.  A gas public utility shall bear the burden to prove that the actual total incremental program costs to implement an approved utility innovation plan are reasonable.  Prudently incurred costs incurred pursuant to an approved plan and prudently incurred costs for obtaining the third-party analyses required under paragraphs (7) and (8) of subsection a. of this section, are recoverable through the cost recovery mechanisms described in an approved plan provided that, after notice and comment, the board determines that the costs included for recovery through the rate schedule are prudently incurred.  Annual adjustments shall include a rate of return, income taxes on the rate of return, incremental property taxes, incremental depreciation expenses, and incremental operation and maintenance expenses.  The rate of return shall be at the level approved by the board in the gas public utility's last base rate case. e.  Upon approval of a utility's plan, the board shall establish plan cost-effectiveness objectives based on the cost-benefit review for innovative resources established pursuant to section 4 of this act.  The cost-effectiveness objective for each plan shall strive to demonstrate incremental progress from the previously approved plan's cost-effectiveness objective, if applicable.  In the event progress is not being made, the gas public utility shall provide context regarding the circumstances. f.  A gas public utility with an approved plan may, within any 365-day period of time within the five years of the plan's commencement, shift budgets between individual innovative resources, in the following manner: (1) up to and including 25 percent of the total plan budget may be shifted with notification to the board and rate counsel; and (2) greater than 25 percent of the total plan budget may be shifted with board approval. g.  A gas public utility with an approved plan shall provide annual reports to the board regarding the work completed pursuant to the plan.  An annual report may include: (1) the costs incurred under the plan; (2) lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction or avoidance accomplished under the plan; (3) a description of the processes used to track, verify, and retire the innovative resources and associated environmental attributes; (4) an update on the lifecycle greenhouse gas accounting methodology consistent with current Department of Environmental Protection inventory reporting methodology; (5) an update on the economic impact of the plan including job creation; and (6) the utility's progress toward achieving the cost-effectiveness objectives established by the board on approval of the plan. h.  Each utility innovation plan shall be in effect for five years.  Once a gas public utility has an approved innovation plan, it may file a new innovation plan within four years for implementation at the end of the prior five-year plan period. i.  For the purposes of this act, including the board's lifecycle carbon accounting framework and cost-benefit review for innovative resources carried out pursuant to section 4 of this act, whenever an analysis or estimate of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions, lifecycle greenhouse gas avoidance, or lifecycle greenhouse gas intensity is required, the analysis shall include a description of (1) avoided or reduced emissions attributable to utility operations; (2) avoided or reduced emissions from the production, processing, and transmission of fuels prior to receipt by the utility; and (3) avoided or reduced emissions at the point of end use.  In no event shall the analysis count any one unit of greenhouse gas emissions avoidance or reduction more than once.  An analysis or estimate may rely on emissions factors, default values, or engineering estimates from a publicly accessible source, where direct measurement is not technically or economically feasible, if such emissions factors, default values, or engineering estimates can be demonstrated to produce a reasonable estimate of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, avoidance, or intensity. j.  Any electric end-use equipment installed pursuant to an approved utility innovation plan shall be the exclusive property of the owner of the property on which the equipment is installed. 4.  a.  In reviewing the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions of the innovative resources within a utility innovation plan, the Department of Environmental Protection, in consultation with the board, shall review the consistency of the plan with the departments current greenhouse gas emissions inventory reporting methodology, and the State's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals established by the "Global Warming Response Act," P.L.2007, c.112 (C.26:2C-37 et al.).  This review shall conclude no later than 180 days from the date of a gas public utilitys filing with the board. b.  In reviewing the cost-benefit analytic framework of the innovative resources within a gas utilitys innovation plan, the board shall do so in a manner consistent with the boards existing guidelines and processes for other utility investment programs.  This shall include consideration of any important additional economic costs and benefits, programmatic costs and benefits, additional environmental costs and benefits, and other costs or benefits that may be expected under a plan. 5.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, to be known as the "Emission Reduction Innovation Act," would authorize gas public utilities to develop and implement "utility innovation plans," which would aim to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas use in the State through the use of biogas, renewable natural gas, power-to-hydrogen, power-to-ammonia, carbon capture and utilization, the deployment of a hybrid energy, district energy, or energy efficiency project, and the use of other innovative technologies proposed by the utility. The bill would establish certain content requirements for utility innovation plans, as enumerated in subsections a. through c. of section 3 of the bill.  The plans would be required to be submitted to the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) for approval. Each plan would be effective for five years, after which the utility would be authorized to submit an updated plan. The bill would require a gas public utility to show that the costs to implement an approved utility innovation plan are reasonable.  If approved by the board, the utility could recover the costs of implementing the plan through the rates it charges to its ratepayers or using another methodology.  The bill would authorize utilities to shift up to 25 percent of the total plan budget between individual projects or programs, after providing notice to the BPU and rate counsel.  Shifts greater than 25 percent of the total plan budget would require BPU approval. The bill would require gas public utilities that are implementing approved utility innovation plans to submit an annual report to the BPU on the status of the plan.  The bill would authorize the report to include certain items including the costs incurred under the plan and the lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction or avoidance accomplished under the plan; Section 4 of the bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in consultation with the BPU, to review the methodology by which a utility innovation plan calculates the lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions associated with the plan. The DEP would be required to ensure that the methodology is consistent with its own current methodology for measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions, as well as that the plan is consistent with the State's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals established by the "Global Warming Response Act," P.L.2007, c.112 (C.26:2C-37 et al.).  The DEP would have 180 days to complete its review.  Section 4 of the bill would also require that, when the BPU reviews the cost-benefit analytic framework of a proposed utility innovation plan, it does so in a manner consistent with the boards existing guidelines and processes for other utility investment programs.

STATEMENT This bill, to be known as the "Emission Reduction Innovation Act," would authorize gas public utilities to develop and implement "utility innovation plans," which would aim to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas use in the State through the use of biogas, renewable natural gas, power-to-hydrogen, power-to-ammonia, carbon capture and utilization, the deployment of a hybrid energy, district energy, or energy efficiency project, and the use of other innovative technologies proposed by the utility. The bill would establish certain content requirements for utility innovation plans, as enumerated in subsections a. through c. of section 3 of the bill.  The plans would be required to be submitted to the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) for approval. Each plan would be effective for five years, after which the utility would be authorized to submit an updated plan. The bill would require a gas public utility to show that the costs to implement an approved utility innovation plan are reasonable.  If approved by the board, the utility could recover the costs of implementing the plan through the rates it charges to its ratepayers or using another methodology.  The bill would authorize utilities to shift up to 25 percent of the total plan budget between individual projects or programs, after providing notice to the BPU and rate counsel.  Shifts greater than 25 percent of the total plan budget would require BPU approval. The bill would require gas public utilities that are implementing approved utility innovation plans to submit an annual report to the BPU on the status of the plan.  The bill would authorize the report to include certain items including the costs incurred under the plan and the lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction or avoidance accomplished under the plan; Section 4 of the bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in consultation with the BPU, to review the methodology by which a utility innovation plan calculates the lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions associated with the plan. The DEP would be required to ensure that the methodology is consistent with its own current methodology for measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions, as well as that the plan is consistent with the State's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals established by the "Global Warming Response Act," P.L.2007, c.112 (C.26:2C-37 et al.).  The DEP would have 180 days to complete its review.  Section 4 of the bill would also require that, when the BPU reviews the cost-benefit analytic framework of a proposed utility innovation plan, it does so in a manner consistent with the boards existing guidelines and processes for other utility investment programs.
