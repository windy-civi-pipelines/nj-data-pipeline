The provisions of the bill give the DOH the right to enter the premises of a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer at which candy is manufactured, stored, sold, or offered for sale in order to determine compliance with the provisions of the bill. The DOH would be allowed to, at any time during normal business hours and upon presentation of appropriate credentials: conduct inspections, including taking samples of candy for testing purposes; and purchase any sample of candy at a retail establishment, if requested to do so by the retailer. Whenever the Commissioner of Health finds that adulterated candy is being stored, sold, or offered for sale in violation of the provisions of the bill, the commissioner may issue an order requiring the distributor or retailer to:  cause the adulterated candy to be removed from the premises and made unavailable for purchase; and return the entire inventory of adulterated candy to the manufacturer from which it was obtained, at the manufacturers expense.

Civil penalties imposed under the provisions of the bill are to be collected pursuant to the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999. The commissioner or Attorney General may file an action in Superior Court for a violation of the provisions of the bill, including petitioning for injunctive relief or to recover any costs or damages incurred by the State in connection with a civil violation. Each violation of the provisions of the bill will constitute a separate violation for which the commissioner may obtain relief. The bill does not impose liability on news media that accept or publish advertising that may fall within the scope of the bill. The bill also establishes a separate, nonlapsing fund known as the Reduction of Adulterated Candy Enforcement Fund in the Department of the Treasury.  The fund would be the depository for all penalties received pursuant to the bill, and all fees collected by the DOH to defray the cost of compliance, monitoring, inspection, sampling, testing, and enforcement activities required under the bill.  The monies in the fund, and any interest earned, would be used by the DOH to administer and enforce the provisions of the bill, unless otherwise specified by law.
