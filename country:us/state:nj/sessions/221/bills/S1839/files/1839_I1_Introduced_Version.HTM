<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill clarifies existing
law that the Fish and Game Council is empowered as the sole State governmental
entity responsible for determining whether or not any species of fresh water
fish, game bird, game animal, or fur-bearing animal may be fished, hunted, or
trapped, and in determining what circumstances, when and in what localities, by
what means and in what amounts and numbers those species may be fished, hunted,
or trapped.  The bill also clarifies existing law to require the Division of
Fish and Wildlife, the division director, the Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP), and the Commissioner of Environmental Protection to implement
the State Fish and Game Code as adopted by the council and any comprehensive
policies concerned therewith as formulated by the council, all as directed by
the council.  The bill further emphasizes the autonomy of the council
pertaining to matters of fresh water fishing, hunting, and trapping by removing
the council from the division and instead locating it in, but not of, the
division and the DEP.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is necessary to
correct the clearly erroneous interpretation of the statutory law given
recently by the New Jersey Supreme Court in the case of <u>U.S. Sportsmen's
Alliance Foundation</u> v. <u>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection</u>. 
In its February 28, 2005 decision in that case, the Court reversed a
well-reasoned, unanimous three-judge Appellate Division opinion and thereby
stopped the black bear hunt scheduled for December 2004 until certain specified
conditions were met.  In doing so, the Supreme Court found that the Fish and
Game Council and the Commissioner of Environmental Protection have &quot;shared
responsibility&quot; regarding the formulation of comprehensive policies pertaining
to game animals, including black bears.  The effect of this decision was to
give the commissioner veto authority over any action taken by the council,
thereby transforming the council into a mere advisory body.  This result is
clearly contrary to the statutory law establishing the Fish and Game Council as
a fully capable regulatory body, providing for adoption of the State Fish and
Game Code by the council only, and establishing the State Fish and Game Code as
the only mechanism by which fresh water fishing, hunting, and trapping is
regulated in the State.  The Court's decision wrongly upset an established
statutory framework, over 50 years of precedent, and the designed and mutually
accepted working relationship established by the council with the Division of
Fish and Wildlife over that time period since the council was created by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 16 of this bill also
provides that lands under the administration, ownership, management, or control
of the Division of Fish and Wildlife or the DEP which were acquired in whole or
in part with monies from the &quot;hunters' and anglers' license fund,&quot;
from the New Jersey Waterfowl Stamp Account, or with federal aid for fish and
wildlife purposes, shall not be closed to the taking of any species of freshwater
fish or wildlife in accordance with the State Fish and Game Code by the action
of any State agency or official without the approval of the Fish and Game
Council.  This section responds in part to an Appellate Division opinion issued
 November 24, 2004 in the case of <u>Safari Club International</u> v. <u>New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection</u> in which the court
interpreted the current statutory law in support of affirming the notice
recently issued by the Commissioner of Environmental Protection closing all lands
owned, managed or controlled by the DEP to bear hunting.</p>
