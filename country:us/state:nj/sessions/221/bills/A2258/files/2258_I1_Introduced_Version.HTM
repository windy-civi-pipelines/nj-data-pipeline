STATEMENT This bill establishes a three-year pilot program under which counties are to formulate plans for issuing a Code Red alert on extreme heat days to municipal governments, social service agencies, and non-profit organizations that provide services to certain at-risk individuals. Each county office of emergency management is required to coordinate with municipal emergency management coordinators in municipalities with a documented homeless population of at least 10 people in developing consistent Code Red alert plans throughout the county that provide for communication and outreach, cooling centers, and transportation during implementation of a Code Red alert plan. This plan may be carried out by designated volunteer organizations, which are to receive cooperation and logistical support from the municipal coordinator but are to operate autonomously. A county emergency management coordinator should declare the Code Red alert when the National Weather Service declares a heat advisory for that countys region. Following the conclusion of the pilot program, the bill permits counties to submit their certified costs incurred under the program to the State Office of Emergency Management for reimbursement. The bill also requires the office to submit a report to the Governor and Legislature on the pilot program and to recommend whether or not to make the program permanent. The bill provides Good Samaritan protection from civil liability to the State and local governments and their employees, as well as to volunteer organizations and their members who, during implementation of a Code Red alert plan, provide emergency cooling centers to at-risk individuals.
