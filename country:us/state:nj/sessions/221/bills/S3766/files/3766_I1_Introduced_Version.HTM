of information between member states related to the licensure, investigation,
and discipline of the practice of cosmetology; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Provide for the
licensure and mobility of the workforce in the profession, while addressing the
shortage of workers and lessening the associated burdens on the member states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  (1)   The executive
and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce
this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the
compact. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Venue is proper and
judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be brought solely and
exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of
the Commission is located.  The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative
dispute resolution proceedings.  Nothing herein shall affect or limit the
selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for
professional malpractice, misconduct or any similar matter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The Commission shall be
entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to
intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide the
Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
Commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  If the Commission
determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules,
the Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state.  The
notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
default, and any other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer
training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The Commission shall
provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If a state in default
fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member
states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this
compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the
default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities
incurred during the period of default. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Termination of
membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of
securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or
terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting state's
state licensing authority and each of the member states' state licensing
authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   A state that has been
terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
extend beyond the effective date of termination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Upon the termination of a
state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately provide
notice to all licensees who hold a multistate license within that state of
termination.  The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses
granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of
said notice of termination.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   The Commission shall not
bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has
been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
Commission and the defaulting state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   The defaulting state may
appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
principal offices.  The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1) Upon request by a
member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the
compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member
states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The Commission shall
promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution
for disputes as appropriate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1) The Commission, in
the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this
compact and the Commission's rules. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   By majority vote as
provided by Commission rule, the Commission may initiate legal action against a
member state in default in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to
enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated
rules.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In
the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.  The
remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission.  The
Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting
member state's law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   A member state may
initiate legal action against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and
its promulgated rules.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing
party shall be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney's
fees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   No individual or entity
other than a member state may enforce this compact against the Commission. <br

come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law
in the seventh member state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   On or after the
effective date of the compact, the Commission shall convene and review the
enactment of each of the charter member states to determine if the statute
enacted by each charter member state is materially different than the model
compact statute. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   A charter member state
whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact
statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in Article XII. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   If any member state is
later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the compact,
the Commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect
even if the number of member states should be less than seven.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Member states enacting
the compact subsequent to the charter member states shall be subject to the
process set forth in paragraph 24 of subsection c. of Article IX to determine
if enactments are materially different from the model compact statute and if
the state qualifies for participation in the compact. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   All actions taken for
the benefit of the Commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the
Commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the
Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Any state that joins the
compact shall be subject to the Commission's rules and bylaws as they exist on
the date on which the Compact becomes law in that state.  Any rule that has
been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect
of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Any member state may
withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing that state's
enactment of the compact. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A member state's
withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the
repealing statute. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Withdrawal shall not
affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's state licensing
authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting
requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Upon the enactment of a
statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately provide notice
of a withdrawal to all licensees within that state.  Notwithstanding any
subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, a withdrawing state shall
continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a
minimum of 180 days after the date of a notice of withdrawal. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Nothing contained in
this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure

amended by the member states.  No amendment to this compact shall become
effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws
of all member states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.  This compact and the
Commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to
effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration of the
compact.  Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the
promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission's
rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The provisions of this
compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of
this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact,
or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government,
agency, person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the
applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance
shall not be affected thereby.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Notwithstanding subsection
b. of Article XIV, the Commission may deny a state's participation in the
compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Article XII, terminate a
member state's participation in the compact, if it determines that a
constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the
compact.  Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the
constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and
effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the
member state affected as to all severable matters. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill will enter New
Jersey into the Cosmetology Licensure Compact.  The compact establishes a
multistate license system in which an individual licensed as a cosmetologist
needs only to obtain licensure in one state that is a party to the compact in
order to practice as a cosmetologist in another member state to the compact, so
long as certain requirements established under the compact are met by the
individual.  Under the bill, provisions are established regarding, among other
items, the authority of a member states licensing authority; how an adverse
action against a multistate licensee is managed; the set-up of the Cosmetology
Licensure Compact Commission and its Executive Committee; the collection of
data on member states; and how to withdraw from the compact, if sought by a member
state.</p>
