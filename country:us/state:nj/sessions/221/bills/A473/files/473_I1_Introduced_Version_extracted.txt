However, a municipality that has enacted an ordinance to permit the operation of pedicabs may not prohibit the consumption of alcoholic beverages by passengers as long as the consumption otherwise meets statutory requirements, such as minimum passenger age for consumption and type of alcoholic beverages to be consumed. This bill provides municipalities with the discretion to authorize passenger consumption of alcoholic beverages by ordinance adopted by the governing body of the municipality.
