Baer Open Public Meetings Act, P.L.1975, c.231 (C.10:4-6 et seq.).  The chairman shall serve for a term of one year and may be reelected. f.     The chairman shall appoint three members actively engaged in farming to serve with the representatives of the general public for the purpose of mediating disputes pursuant to the provisions of section 19 of [this act] P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-26) . g.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections a. and b. of this section, any public body established by the governing body of any county prior to May 3, 1982 which was established to carry out functions substantially similar to the functions of boards pursuant to [this act] P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-11 et seq.) and which proposes to apply for grants pursuant hereto may carry out the functions authorized herein, provided that within five years following the effective date of [this act] P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-11 et seq.) those boards established prior to May 3, 1982 shall reorganize so that the board reflects no more than a simple majority of members actively engaged in farming or equal representation of the general public and those actively engaged in farming. (cf: P.L.1993, c.19, s.1) 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill amends current law concerning membership of county agriculture development boards (CADBs) and the process for the filing of complaints under the Right to Farm Act, P.L.1983, c.31 (C.4:1C-1 et al.). Specifically, this bill would provide a mechanism for how Right to Farm disputes may be resolved if a CADB does not have quorum due to members with conflicts of interest.  Under current law, in the event of a dispute, an individual or municipality aggrieved by the operation of a commercial farm is required to file a formal complaint with the appropriate CADB, or the State Agriculture Development Committee in counties where no CADB exists, prior to filing action in court.  Under this bill, if a CADB is unable to convene a quorum due to members having conflicts of interest related to the filed complaint, the complaint may be filed with the CADB located in the adjacent county located closest to the commercial farm that is the subject of the complaint. In addition, this bill amends the Agriculture Retention and Development Act, P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-11 et seq.), by creating alternate members on CADBs who would are able to vote in the absence or disqualification of a voting member.  This bill would require each CADB to have two alternate members.  The alternate members would be required to be actively engaged in farming and either be a resident of the county or a member of the CADB in an adjacent county.  These alternate members would each serve for a term of four years and may vote in place of an appointed voting member who is actively engaged in farming should a voting member be absent or disqualified. The alternate voting member may participate in discussions of the proceedings when not voting.  The alternate members would be appointed in the same manner as the four members actively engaged in farming.
