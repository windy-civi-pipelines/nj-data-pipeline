While no minimum time period of captivity exists as eligibility criteria for the medal, the Department of Veterans Affairs should determine each case on its merits. c.     The medal shall be issued only to those taken prisoner by foreign armed forces that are hostile to the United States, under circumstances which the commissioner, or a designee, finds to have been comparable to those under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict. d.    Any person convicted by a United States military tribunal of misconduct or a criminal charge or whose discharge is less than honorable based on actions while a POW-MIA is ineligible for the medal.  Any POW-MIA whose conduct was not in accord with the Code of Conduct, and whose actions are documented by United States military records, is ineligible for the medal.  Resolution of questionable cases shall be the responsibility of the commissioner or a designee. e.     No more than one medal shall be awarded.  For subsequent acts justifying award of the medal, service stars shall be awarded and worn on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal.  A period of captivity terminates on return to United States military control. Escapees who do not return to United States military control and are recaptured by an enemy do not begin a new period of captivity for subsequent award of the medal. f.     The medal may be awarded for a deceased person or a person absent as a prisoner of war or missing in action and, when so directed, may be presented to such representatives, as the commissioner considers appropriate, who submit all of the required forms and documentation on behalf of that person. Return of remains, in and of itself, does not constitute evidence of POW-MIA status. g.  The Department of Veterans Affairs shall receive requests for, and issue, the medal to eligible individuals or their next-of-kin, who shall use the Department of Veterans Affairs application for award/program" application, attaching a copy of DD Form 214 or WD Form 53 and death certificate copy, if applicable. h.  There is created in the Department of the Treasury a special, non-lapsing fund to be known as the "POW-MIA Medal Fund."  There shall be deposited into the fund the amounts made available for the purposes of the fund and monetary donations that may be received from any source for the purposes of the fund and any interest earned thereon.  Monies deposited in the fund shall be dedicated for the design, manufacture, and distribution of the medal. 68.  (New section)  a.

STATEMENT This bill creates a new Department of Veterans Affairs as a principal department in the executive branch of State government.  All divisions and programs concerning veterans now in the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs are continued and transferred to the new Department of Veterans Affairs.  The programs that do not concern veterans are continued in what will be referred to as the Department of Military Affairs.  This bill does not create any new divisions or programs. All of the bill's provisions exist in current law and have been duplicated in this bill to provide for their recodification in a new Title 38B. Corresponding provisions of current law now codified in Title 38A are repealed. New Jersey's veterans have maintained their proud allegiance to the United States and have fought and died to preserve and protect our freedom and way of life.  The Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs, which is the current principal government agency that serves this State's veterans, has done an especially commendable job attending to this special group of residents.  However, the department has significant priorities with regard to maintaining the strength and readiness of the National Guard and providing for homeland security.  While many other states in the United States have a separate cabinet-level department for veterans affairs, New Jersey lacks an executive department which is concerned primarily with the needs and problems of veterans in this State.  It is in the public interest to incorporate various services and programs which pertain specifically to veterans and their families and dependents into an executive agency which can serve their specific and special needs more efficiently than is possible at present.

While no minimum time period of captivity exists as eligibility criteria for the medal, the Department of Veterans Affairs should determine each case on its merits. c.     The medal shall be issued only to those taken prisoner by foreign armed forces that are hostile to the United States, under circumstances which the commissioner, or a designee, finds to have been comparable to those under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict. d.    Any person convicted by a United States military tribunal of misconduct or a criminal charge or whose discharge is less than honorable based on actions while a POW-MIA is ineligible for the medal.  Any POW-MIA whose conduct was not in accord with the Code of Conduct, and whose actions are documented by United States military records, is ineligible for the medal.  Resolution of questionable cases shall be the responsibility of the commissioner or a designee. e.     No more than one medal shall be awarded.  For subsequent acts justifying award of the medal, service stars shall be awarded and worn on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal.  A period of captivity terminates on return to United States military control. Escapees who do not return to United States military control and are recaptured by an enemy do not begin a new period of captivity for subsequent award of the medal. f.     The medal may be awarded for a deceased person or a person absent as a prisoner of war or missing in action and, when so directed, may be presented to such representatives, as the commissioner considers appropriate, who submit all of the required forms and documentation on behalf of that person. Return of remains, in and of itself, does not constitute evidence of POW-MIA status. g.  The Department of Veterans Affairs shall receive requests for, and issue, the medal to eligible individuals or their next-of-kin, who shall use the Department of Veterans Affairs application for award/program" application, attaching a copy of DD Form 214 or WD Form 53 and death certificate copy, if applicable. h.  There is created in the Department of the Treasury a special, non-lapsing fund to be known as the "POW-MIA Medal Fund."  There shall be deposited into the fund the amounts made available for the purposes of the fund and monetary donations that may be received from any source for the purposes of the fund and any interest earned thereon.  Monies deposited in the fund shall be dedicated for the design, manufacture, and distribution of the medal. 68.  (New section)  a.

STATEMENT This bill creates a new Department of Veterans Affairs as a principal department in the executive branch of State government.  All divisions and programs concerning veterans now in the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs are continued and transferred to the new Department of Veterans Affairs.  The programs that do not concern veterans are continued in what will be referred to as the Department of Military Affairs.  This bill does not create any new divisions or programs. All of the bill's provisions exist in current law and have been duplicated in this bill to provide for their recodification in a new Title 38B. Corresponding provisions of current law now codified in Title 38A are repealed. New Jersey's veterans have maintained their proud allegiance to the United States and have fought and died to preserve and protect our freedom and way of life.  The Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs, which is the current principal government agency that serves this State's veterans, has done an especially commendable job attending to this special group of residents.  However, the department has significant priorities with regard to maintaining the strength and readiness of the National Guard and providing for homeland security.  While many other states in the United States have a separate cabinet-level department for veterans affairs, New Jersey lacks an executive department which is concerned primarily with the needs and problems of veterans in this State.  It is in the public interest to incorporate various services and programs which pertain specifically to veterans and their families and dependents into an executive agency which can serve their specific and special needs more efficiently than is possible at present.
