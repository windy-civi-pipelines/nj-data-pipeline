STATEMENT This bill requires health insurers (health, hospital and medical service corporations, commercial individual and group health insurers, health maintenance organizations, health benefits plans issued pursuant to the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage and Small Employer Health Benefits Programs, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Program) to provide coverage for mammograms for women 35 years of age or older.  Existing law requires insurers to provide the coverage for women 40 years of age or older. Under the bill, insurers are required to provide coverage for one baseline mammogram examination for women who are 35 years of age; a mammogram examination every year for women age 35 and over; and, in the case of a woman who is under 35 years of age and has a family history of breast cancer or other breast cancer risk factors, a mammogram examination at such age and intervals as deemed medically necessary by the woman's health care provider. Lowers age at which certain insurers are required to provide coverage for mammograms.
