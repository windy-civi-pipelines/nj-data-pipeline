A5717 1R [First Reprint] ASSEMBLY, No. 5717 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 22, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ANDREA KATZ District 8 (Atlantic and Burlington) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Haider SYNOPSIS Makes various changes to provision of preschool aid and facilities requirements; establishes Universal Preschool Implementation Steering Committee; requires full-day kindergarten in all school districts. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Assembly Education Committee on June 16, 2025, with amendments. An Act concerning early childhood education, amending various parts of the statutory law, and supplementing P.L.2007, c.260 1and chapters 26 and 44 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes1. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. (New section)  Sections 1 and 2 1[,] and1 6 through 1[12, and 15] 111 of this act shall be known and may be cited as the New Jersey Universal Preschool and Kindergarten Act. 2.  (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  Research is clear that high-quality preschool can change the educational trajectories of young children, particularly economically disadvantaged children and multilingual learners. Improvements in literacy, numeracy, social-emotional and self-regulatory development, and lifetime earnings have been demonstrated among individuals who attend high-quality preschool compared to their peers. b.  New Jersey leads the nation in expanding access to high-quality preschool opportunities. The State has achieved a unique and world-class combination of significant financial investment and rigorous quality standards. New Jersey State-funded preschools are required to serve three- and four-year olds in full-day programs featuring small class sizes led by quality instructors with ample curriculum support, professional development, and accommodations for students with special needs. New Jerseys State spending on preschool is among the highest in the country, with clear, significant impacts on our public school system: tens of thousands of three- and four-year olds in hundreds of communities around the State attend transformative high-quality early education programs. c.  District-operated preschool programs, licensed childcare centers, and Head Start programs form an interrelated and interdependent early childhood ecosystem. Each component is made stronger by the other, and the system is greater and more impactful than the sum of its parts. No component can reach its full potential without the facilities, staff, resources, and expertise of the others. Together, the system represents a continuum of education and care services from birth through age five necessary not only for children to realize their full life potential, but for families to participate fully in economic and civic society. To lift up this system is a moral and economic imperative. d.  To build on the States preschool expansion progress to date and to realize the full benefits of high-quality preschool, it is fitting and proper for the State to enshrine certain policies and values in State law, including: (1)  providing sustainable, annual financial support for expanding access to high-quality preschool; (2)  codifying preschool education aid provisions previously implemented through language in various annual appropriations acts and harmonizing New Jersey law accordingly; (3)  prioritizing expansion for economically disadvantaged families and communities; (4)  requiring State-funded preschool programs to make every effort to partner with local ready, willing, and able licensed childcare providers and Head Start programs; and (5)  conducting ongoing evaluations of the States approach to early childhood and preschool education to ensure that policy continues to reflect stakeholder expertise and evolving research. e.  In addition to high-quality preschool education, full-day kindergarten is necessary not only to unlock a childs full learning potential, but to facilitate a smooth transition from high-quality preschool into elementary programs. 3.  Section 3 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.18A:7F-38) is amended to read as follows: 3. a. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a school district shall not adopt a budget pursuant to sections 5 and 6 of P.L.1996, c.138 (C.18A:7F-5 and 18A:7F-6) with an increase in its adjusted tax levy that exceeds, except as provided in subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.18A:7F-39), the tax levy growth limitation calculated as follows: the sum of the prebudget year adjusted tax levy and the adjustment for increases in enrollment multiplied by 2.0 percent, and adjustments for an increase in health care costs, increases in amounts for certain normal and accrued liability pension contributions set forth in sections 1 and 2 of P.L.2009, c.19 amending section 24 of P.L.1954, c.84 (C.43:15A-24) and section 15 of P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-15) for the year set forth in those sections, [and,] in the case of an SDA district as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3), during the 2018-2019 through the 2024-2025 school years, increases to raise a general fund tax levy to an amount that does not exceed its local share , and, in the case of a school district first receiving preschool education aid in the 2025-2026, 2026-2027, or 2027-2028 school years and participating in the pilot program established by the commissioner pursuant to subsection h. of 12 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-54), increases to raise a general fund tax levy for the local share of preschool education costs. b. (1) The allowable adjustment for increases in enrollment authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal the per pupil prebudget year adjusted tax levy multiplied by EP, where EP equals the sum of: (a)   0.50 for each unit of weighted resident enrollment that constitutes an increase from the prebudget year over 1%, but not more than 2.5%; (b)   0.75 for each unit of weighted resident enrollment that constitutes an increase from the prebudget year over 2.5%, but not more than 4%; and (c)   1.00 for each unit of weighted resident enrollment that constitutes an increase from the prebudget year over 4%. (2)   A school district may request approval from the commissioner to calculate EP equal to 1.00 for any increase in weighted resident enrollment if it can demonstrate that the calculation pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection would result in an average class size that exceeds 10% above the facilities efficiency standards established pursuant to P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.). c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.44) d. (1) The allowable adjustment for increases in health care costs authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal that portion of the actual increase in total health care costs for the budget year, less any withdrawals from the current expense emergency reserve account for increases in total health care costs, that exceeds 2.0 percent of the total health care costs in the prebudget year, but that is not in excess of the product of the total health care costs in the prebudget year multiplied by the average percentage increase of the State Health Benefits Program, P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.), as annually determined by the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury. (2)   The allowable adjustment for increases in the amount of normal and accrued liability pension contributions authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal that portion of the actual increase in total normal and accrued liability pension contributions for the budget year that exceeds 2.0 percent of the total normal and accrued liability pension contributions in the prebudget year. (3)   In the case of an SDA district, as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3), in which the prebudget year adjusted tax levy is less than the school district's prebudget year local share as calculated pursuant to section 10 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-52), the allowable adjustment for increases to raise a tax levy that does not exceed the school district's local share shall equal the difference between the prebudget year adjusted tax levy and the prebudget year local share. (4)  In the case of a school district first receiving preschool education aid in the 2025-2026, 2026-2027, or 2027-2028 school years and participating in the pilot program established by the commissioner pursuant to subsection h. of 12 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-54), the allowable adjustment for increases to raise a general fund tax levy for the local share of preschool education costs shall be equal to the actual increase required to provide preschool education under the pilot program less State aid provided pursuant to subsection h. of 12 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-54). A school district first receiving preschool education aid in the 2025-2026 school year and participating in the pilot program established by the commissioner pursuant to subsection h. of 12 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-54) may, prior to the delivery of tax bills pursuant to R.S.54:4-64, recertify to the county board of taxation the sum to be raised in the district during the ensuing school year if the change in the amount to be raised is equal to the districts local share of preschool education costs for that school year. e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.44) f.     The adjusted tax levy shall be increased or decreased accordingly whenever the responsibility and associated cost of a school district activity is transferred to another school district or governmental entity.

A5717 1R [First Reprint] ASSEMBLY, No. 5717 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 22, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ANDREA KATZ District 8 (Atlantic and Burlington) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Haider SYNOPSIS Makes various changes to provision of preschool aid and facilities requirements; establishes Universal Preschool Implementation Steering Committee; requires full-day kindergarten in all school districts. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Assembly Education Committee on June 16, 2025, with amendments. An Act concerning early childhood education, amending various parts of the statutory law, and supplementing P.L.2007, c.260 1and chapters 26 and 44 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes1. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. (New section)  Sections 1 and 2 1[,] and1 6 through 1[12, and 15] 111 of this act shall be known and may be cited as the New Jersey Universal Preschool and Kindergarten Act. 2.  (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  Research is clear that high-quality preschool can change the educational trajectories of young children, particularly economically disadvantaged children and multilingual learners. Improvements in literacy, numeracy, social-emotional and self-regulatory development, and lifetime earnings have been demonstrated among individuals who attend high-quality preschool compared to their peers. b.  New Jersey leads the nation in expanding access to high-quality preschool opportunities. The State has achieved a unique and world-class combination of significant financial investment and rigorous quality standards. New Jersey State-funded preschools are required to serve three- and four-year olds in full-day programs featuring small class sizes led by quality instructors with ample curriculum support, professional development, and accommodations for students with special needs. New Jerseys State spending on preschool is among the highest in the country, with clear, significant impacts on our public school system: tens of thousands of three- and four-year olds in hundreds of communities around the State attend transformative high-quality early education programs. c.  District-operated preschool programs, licensed childcare centers, and Head Start programs form an interrelated and interdependent early childhood ecosystem. Each component is made stronger by the other, and the system is greater and more impactful than the sum of its parts. No component can reach its full potential without the facilities, staff, resources, and expertise of the others. Together, the system represents a continuum of education and care services from birth through age five necessary not only for children to realize their full life potential, but for families to participate fully in economic and civic society. To lift up this system is a moral and economic imperative. d.  To build on the States preschool expansion progress to date and to realize the full benefits of high-quality preschool, it is fitting and proper for the State to enshrine certain policies and values in State law, including: (1)  providing sustainable, annual financial support for expanding access to high-quality preschool; (2)  codifying preschool education aid provisions previously implemented through language in various annual appropriations acts and harmonizing New Jersey law accordingly; (3)  prioritizing expansion for economically disadvantaged families and communities; (4)  requiring State-funded preschool programs to make every effort to partner with local ready, willing, and able licensed childcare providers and Head Start programs; and (5)  conducting ongoing evaluations of the States approach to early childhood and preschool education to ensure that policy continues to reflect stakeholder expertise and evolving research. e.  In addition to high-quality preschool education, full-day kindergarten is necessary not only to unlock a childs full learning potential, but to facilitate a smooth transition from high-quality preschool into elementary programs. 3.  Section 3 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.18A:7F-38) is amended to read as follows: 3. a. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a school district shall not adopt a budget pursuant to sections 5 and 6 of P.L.1996, c.138 (C.18A:7F-5 and 18A:7F-6) with an increase in its adjusted tax levy that exceeds, except as provided in subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.18A:7F-39), the tax levy growth limitation calculated as follows: the sum of the prebudget year adjusted tax levy and the adjustment for increases in enrollment multiplied by 2.0 percent, and adjustments for an increase in health care costs, increases in amounts for certain normal and accrued liability pension contributions set forth in sections 1 and 2 of P.L.2009, c.19 amending section 24 of P.L.1954, c.84 (C.43:15A-24) and section 15 of P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-15) for the year set forth in those sections, [and,] in the case of an SDA district as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3), during the 2018-2019 through the 2024-2025 school years, increases to raise a general fund tax levy to an amount that does not exceed its local share , and, in the case of a school district first receiving preschool education aid in the 2025-2026, 2026-2027, or 2027-2028 school years and participating in the pilot program established by the commissioner pursuant to subsection h. of 12 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-54), increases to raise a general fund tax levy for the local share of preschool education costs. b. (1) The allowable adjustment for increases in enrollment authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal the per pupil prebudget year adjusted tax levy multiplied by EP, where EP equals the sum of: (a)   0.50 for each unit of weighted resident enrollment that constitutes an increase from the prebudget year over 1%, but not more than 2.5%; (b)   0.75 for each unit of weighted resident enrollment that constitutes an increase from the prebudget year over 2.5%, but not more than 4%; and (c)   1.00 for each unit of weighted resident enrollment that constitutes an increase from the prebudget year over 4%. (2)   A school district may request approval from the commissioner to calculate EP equal to 1.00 for any increase in weighted resident enrollment if it can demonstrate that the calculation pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection would result in an average class size that exceeds 10% above the facilities efficiency standards established pursuant to P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.). c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.44) d. (1) The allowable adjustment for increases in health care costs authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal that portion of the actual increase in total health care costs for the budget year, less any withdrawals from the current expense emergency reserve account for increases in total health care costs, that exceeds 2.0 percent of the total health care costs in the prebudget year, but that is not in excess of the product of the total health care costs in the prebudget year multiplied by the average percentage increase of the State Health Benefits Program, P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.), as annually determined by the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury. (2)   The allowable adjustment for increases in the amount of normal and accrued liability pension contributions authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal that portion of the actual increase in total normal and accrued liability pension contributions for the budget year that exceeds 2.0 percent of the total normal and accrued liability pension contributions in the prebudget year. (3)   In the case of an SDA district, as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3), in which the prebudget year adjusted tax levy is less than the school district's prebudget year local share as calculated pursuant to section 10 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-52), the allowable adjustment for increases to raise a tax levy that does not exceed the school district's local share shall equal the difference between the prebudget year adjusted tax levy and the prebudget year local share. (4)  In the case of a school district first receiving preschool education aid in the 2025-2026, 2026-2027, or 2027-2028 school years and participating in the pilot program established by the commissioner pursuant to subsection h. of 12 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-54), the allowable adjustment for increases to raise a general fund tax levy for the local share of preschool education costs shall be equal to the actual increase required to provide preschool education under the pilot program less State aid provided pursuant to subsection h. of 12 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-54). A school district first receiving preschool education aid in the 2025-2026 school year and participating in the pilot program established by the commissioner pursuant to subsection h. of 12 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-54) may, prior to the delivery of tax bills pursuant to R.S.54:4-64, recertify to the county board of taxation the sum to be raised in the district during the ensuing school year if the change in the amount to be raised is equal to the districts local share of preschool education costs for that school year. e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.44) f.     The adjusted tax levy shall be increased or decreased accordingly whenever the responsibility and associated cost of a school district activity is transferred to another school district or governmental entity.
