An Act concerning the use of non-wagering casino games by casino licensees to solicit future gaming, and amending P.L.1977, c.110. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 100 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-100) is amended to read as follows: 100.  a.  This act shall not be construed to permit any gaming except the conduct of authorized games in a casino room or through Internet gaming in accordance with this act and the regulations promulgated hereunder and in a simulcasting facility to the extent provided by the "Casino Simulcasting Act," P.L.1992, c.19 (C.5:12-191 et al.). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the division approves the game of keno as an authorized game pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-5), as amended, keno tickets may be sold or redeemed in accordance with division regulations. b.    Gaming equipment shall not be possessed, maintained or exhibited by any person on the premises of a casino hotel except in a casino room, in the simulcasting facility, or in restricted casino areas used for the inspection, repair or storage of such equipment and specifically designated for that purpose by the casino licensee with the approval of the division. Gaming equipment which supports the conduct of gaming in a casino or simulcasting facility or through Internet gaming but does not permit or require patron access, such as computers, or gaming software or other gaming equipment used to conduct Internet gaming may be possessed and maintained by a casino licensee or a qualified holding or intermediary company of a casino licensee in restricted areas specifically approved by the division. No gaming equipment shall be possessed, maintained, exhibited, brought into or removed from a casino room or simulcasting facility by any person unless such equipment is necessary to the conduct of an authorized game, has permanently affixed, imprinted, impressed or engraved thereon an identification number or symbol authorized by the division, is under the exclusive control of a casino licensee or casino licensee's employees, or of any individually qualified employee of a holding company or casino licensee and is brought into or removed from the casino room or simulcasting facility following 24-hour prior notice given to an authorized agent of the division. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, computer equipment used by the slot system operator of a multi-casino progressive slot system to link and communicate with the slot machines of two or more casino licensees for the purpose of calculating and displaying the amount of a progressive jackpot, monitoring the operation of the system, and any other purpose that the division deems necessary and appropriate to the operation or maintenance of the multi-casino progressive slot machine system may, with the prior approval of the division, be possessed, maintained and operated by the slot system operator either in a restricted area on the premises of a casino hotel or in a secure facility inaccessible to the public and specifically designed for that purpose off the premises of a casino hotel but within the territorial limits of Atlantic County, New Jersey. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person may, with the prior approval of the division and under such terms and conditions as may be required by the division, possess, maintain or exhibit gaming equipment in any other area of the casino hotel, provided that such equipment is used for nongaming purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary, the division may, by regulation, authorize the linking of slot machines of one or more casino licensees and slot machines located in casinos licensed by another state of the United States. Wagering and account information for a multi-state slot system shall be transmitted by the operator of such multi-state slot system to either a restricted area on the premises of a casino hotel or to a secure facility inaccessible to the public and specifically designed for that purpose off the premises of a casino hotel but within the territorial limits of Atlantic County, New Jersey, and from there to slot machines of New Jersey casino licensees, provided all locations are approved by the division. Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary, the division may authorize electronic versions of authorized games to be played within an approved hotel facility on mobile gaming devices to be approved by the division, provided the player has established an account with the casino licensee, the wager is placed by and the winnings are paid to the patron in person within the approved hotel facility, the mobile gaming device is inoperable outside the approved hotel facility, and the division authorizes the device for mobile gaming; provided that the division may establish any additional or more stringent licensing and other regulatory requirements necessary for the proper implementation and conduct of mobile gaming as authorized herein.  For the purposes of this provision, the approved hotel facility shall include any area located within the property boundaries of the casino hotel facility, including the swimming pool area and an outdoor recreation area, where mobile gaming devices may be used by patrons in accordance with this provision, but excluding parking garages or parking areas of a casino hotel facility, provided that the division shall ascertain and ensure, pursuant to rules and regulations issued by it to implement mobile gaming pursuant to this provision, that mobile gaming shall not extend outside of the property boundaries of the casino hotel facility. c.     Each casino hotel shall contain a count room and such other secure facilities as may be required by the division for the counting and storage of cash, coins, tokens, checks, plaques, gaming vouchers, coupons, and other devices or items of value used in wagering and approved by the division that are received in the conduct of gaming and for the inspection, counting and storage of dice, cards, chips and other representatives of value. The division shall promulgate regulations for the security of drop boxes and other devices in which the foregoing items are deposited at the gaming tables or in slot machines, and all areas wherein such boxes and devices are kept while in use, which regulations may include certain locking devices. Said drop boxes and other devices shall not be brought into or removed from a casino room or simulcasting facility, or locked or unlocked, except at such times, in such places, and according to such procedures as the division may require. d.    All chips used in gaming shall be of such size and uniform color by denomination as the division shall require by regulation. e.     All gaming shall be conducted according to rules promulgated by the division. All wagers and pay-offs of winning wagers shall be made according to rules promulgated by the division, which shall establish such limitations as may be necessary to assure the vitality of casino operations and fair odds to patrons. Each slot machine shall have a minimum payout of 83%. f.     Each casino licensee shall make available in printed form to any patron upon request the complete text of the rules of the division regarding games and the conduct of gaming, pay-offs of winning wagers, an approximation of the odds of winning for each wager, and such other advice to the player as the division shall require. Each casino licensee shall prominently post within a casino room and simulcasting facility, as appropriate, according to regulations of the division such information about gaming rules, pay-offs of winning wagers, the odds of winning for each wager, and such other advice to the player as the division shall require. g.    Each gaming table shall be equipped with a sign indicating the permissible minimum and maximum wagers pertaining thereto.  All gaming and wagering offered through Internet gaming shall display online the permissible minimum and maximum wagers pertaining thereto.  It shall be unlawful for a casino licensee to require any wager to be greater than the stated minimum or less than the stated maximum; provided, however, that any wager actually made by a patron and not rejected by a casino licensee prior to the commencement of play shall be treated as a valid wager. h.    (1) Except as herein provided, no slot machine shall be used to conduct gaming unless it is identical in all electrical, mechanical and other aspects to a model thereof which has been specifically tested and licensed for use by the division. The division shall also test any other gaming device, gaming equipment, gaming-related device, hardware and software by which authorized gambling games are offered through the Internet, or gross-revenue related device, such as a slot management system, electronic transfer credit system or gaming voucher system as it deems appropriate. In its discretion and for the purpose of expediting the approval process, the division may utilize the services of a private testing laboratory that has obtained a plenary license as a casino service industry enterprise pursuant to subsection a. of section 92 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-92) to perform the testing, and may also utilize applicable data from any such private testing laboratory or from a governmental agency of a state other than New Jersey authorized to regulate slot machines and other gaming devices, gaming equipment, gaming-related devices and gross-revenue related devices used in casino gaming, if the private testing laboratory or governmental agency uses a testing methodology substantially similar to the methodology utilized by the division. The division, in its discretion, may rely upon the data provided by the private testing laboratory or governmental agency and adopt the conclusions of such private testing laboratory or governmental agency regarding any submitted device. (2)   Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (5) of subsection h. of this section, the division shall, within 60 days of its receipt of a complete application for the testing of a slot machine or other gaming equipment model, approve or reject the slot machine or other gaming equipment model. In so doing, the division shall specify whether and to what extent any data from a private testing laboratory or governmental agency of a state other than New Jersey was used in reaching its conclusions and recommendation. If the division is unable to complete the testing of a slot machine or other gaming equipment model within this 60-day period, the division may conditionally approve the slot machine or other gaming equipment model for test use by a casino licensee provided that the division represents that the use of the slot machine or other gaming equipment model will not have a direct and materially adverse impact on the integrity of gaming or the control of gross revenue. The division shall give priority to the testing of slot machines or other gaming equipment which a casino licensee has certified it will use in its casino in this State. (3)   The division shall, by regulation, establish such technical standards for licensure of slot machines, including mechanical and electrical reliability, security against tampering, the comprehensibility of wagering, and noise and light levels, as it may deem necessary to protect the player from fraud or deception and to insure the integrity of gaming. The denominations of such machines shall be set by the licensee; the licensee shall simultaneously notify the division of the settings. (4)   The division shall, by regulation, determine the permissible number and density of slot machines in a licensed casino so as to: (a)   promote optimum security for casino operations; (b)   avoid deception or frequent distraction to players at gaming tables; (c)   promote the comfort of patrons; (d)   create and maintain a gracious playing environment in the casino; and (e)   encourage and preserve competition in casino operations by assuring that a variety of gaming opportunities is offered to the public. Any such regulation promulgated by the division which determines the permissible number and density of slot machines in a licensed casino shall provide that all casino floor space and all space within a casino licensee's casino simulcasting facility shall be included in any calculation of the permissible number and density of slot machines in a licensed casino. (5)   Any new gaming equipment or simulcast wagering equipment that is submitted for testing to the division or to an independent testing laboratory licensed pursuant to subsection a. of section 92 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-92) prior to or simultaneously with submission of such new equipment for testing in a jurisdiction other than New Jersey, may, consistent with regulations promulgated by the division, be deployed by a casino licensee on the casino floor 14 days after submission of such equipment for testing. If the casino or casino service industry enterprise licensee has not received approval for the equipment 14 days after submission for testing, any interested casino licensee may, consistent with division regulations, deploy the equipment on a field test basis, unless otherwise directed by the director. (6)   A casino's primary equipment used to conduct Internet gaming shall be located, with the prior approval of the division, in a restricted area on the premises of the casino hotel or in another facility owned or leased by the casino licensee that is secure, inaccessible to the public, and specifically designed to house that equipment, and where the equipment shall be under the complete control of the casino licensee or its Internet gaming affiliate, within the territorial limits of Atlantic City, New Jersey.  Backup equipment used on a temporary basis pursuant to rules established by the division to conduct Internet gaming may be located outside the territorial limits of Atlantic City, provided no Internet gaming shall occur unless a wager is accepted by a casino within the territorial limits of Atlantic City, New Jersey.  All Internet wagers shall be deemed to be placed when received in Atlantic City by the licensee.  Any intermediate routing of electronic data in connection with a wager shall not affect the fact that the wager is placed in Atlantic City.  For the purposes of this section, a secure facility within Atlantic City that is owned or leased by the casino licensee to house Internet gaming equipment shall be considered to be part of the casino hotel facility notwithstanding that the facility may not be contiguous with the premises of the casino hotel. No software, computer or other gaming equipment shall be used to conduct Internet gaming unless it has been specifically tested by the division.  The division may, in its discretion, and for the purpose of expediting the approval process, refer testing to any testing laboratory with a plenary license as a casino service industry enterprise pursuant to subsection a. of section 92 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-92). The division shall give priority to the testing of software, computers or other gaming equipment which a casino licensee has certified it will use to conduct Internet gaming in this State.  The division shall, by regulation, establish such technical standards for approval of software, computers and other gaming equipment used to conduct Internet gaming, including mechanical, electrical or program reliability, security against tampering, the comprehensibility of wagering, and noise and light levels, as it may deem necessary to protect the player from fraud or deception and to insure the integrity of gaming.  When appropriate, the licensee shall set the denominations of Internet games and shall simultaneously notify the division of the settings. No software, computer or other gaming equipment shall be used to conduct Internet gaming unless it is able to verify that a player placing a wager is physically present in this State.  The division shall require by regulation that the equipment used by every licensee to conduct Internet gaming is, in fact, verifying every player's physical presence in this State each time a player logs onto a new playing session. i.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1991, c.182). j.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1991, c.182). k.    (1)  It shall be unlawful for any person to exchange or redeem chips for anything whatsoever, except for currency, negotiable personal checks, negotiable counter checks, other chips, coupons, slot vouchers or complimentary vouchers distributed by the casino licensee, or, if authorized by regulation of the division, a valid charge to a credit or debit card account. A casino licensee shall, upon the request of any person, redeem that licensee's gaming chips surrendered by that person in any amount over $100 with a check drawn upon the licensee's account at any banking institution in this State and made payable to that person. (2)  It shall be unlawful for a casino licensee, through its agents, employees, or any contracted operator, or any party with which the casino licensee has a relationship, to conduct a non-wagering casino game that provides a reward for immediate or continued participation or that serves to solicit future participation in wagering activities. As used in this subsection, non-wagering casino game means any game, conducted in person or via the Internet, which offers participants an experience equivalent to, or with similar odds of winning as, a game that ordinarily requires a casino license to be conducted, except that the game does not require any initial monetary investment on behalf of the participants to play. l.     It shall be unlawful for any casino licensee or its agents or employees to employ, contract with, or use any shill or barker to induce any person to enter a casino or simulcasting facility or play at any game or for any purpose whatsoever. m.   It shall be unlawful for a dealer in any authorized game in which cards are dealt to deal cards by hand or other than from a device specifically designed for that purpose, unless otherwise permitted by the rules of the division. n.    (1) It shall be unlawful for any casino key employee licensee to wager in any casino or simulcasting facility in this State. (2)   It shall be unlawful for any other employee of a casino licensee who, in the judgment of the division, is directly involved with the conduct of gaming operations, including but not limited to dealers, floor persons, box persons, security and surveillance employees, to wager in any casino or simulcasting facility in the casino hotel in which the employee is employed or in any other casino or simulcasting facility in this State which is owned or operated by an affiliated licensee. (3)   The prohibition against wagering set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall continue for a period of 30 days commencing upon the date that the employee either leaves employment with a casino licensee or is terminated from employment with a casino licensee. o.  (1) It shall be unlawful for any casino key employee or boxman, floorman, or any other casino employee who shall serve in a supervisory position to solicit or accept, and for any other casino employee to solicit, any tip or gratuity from any player or patron at the casino hotel or simulcasting facility where he is employed. (2)   A dealer may accept tips or gratuities from a patron at the table at which such dealer is conducting play, subject to the provisions of this subsection. All such tips or gratuities shall be immediately deposited in a lockbox reserved for that purpose, unless the tip or gratuity is authorized by a patron utilizing an automated wagering system approved by the division. All tips or gratuities shall be accounted for, and placed in a pool for distribution pro rata among the dealers, with the distribution based upon the number of hours each dealer has worked, except that the division may, by regulation, permit a separate pool to be established for dealers in the game of poker, or may permit tips or gratuities to be retained by individual dealers in the game of poker. (3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a casino licensee may require that a percentage of the prize pool offered to participants pursuant to an authorized poker tournament be withheld for distribution to the tournament dealers as tips or gratuities as the division by regulation may approve. p.    Any slot system operator that offers an annuity jackpot shall secure the payment of such jackpot by establishing an annuity jackpot guarantee in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-1 et seq.), and the rules of the division. (cf: P.L.2014, c.23, s.3) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Under this bill, a casino licensee, through its agents, employees, or any contracted operator, or any party with which the casino licensee has a relationship, to conduct a non-wagering casino game that provides a reward for immediate or continued participation or that serves to solicit future participation in wagering activities. As used in this bill, non-wagering casino game means any game, conducted in person or via the Internet, which offers participants an experience equivalent to, or with similar odds of winning as, a game that ordinarily requires a casino license to be conducted, except that the game does not require any initial monetary investment on behalf of the participants to play. This bill is intended to address a practice whereby casinos may engage with applications with games that simulate the experience of playing real casino games, but for fictitious points or credits rather than real world things of value.  The participants in these games, some of whom may be underage at the time, are incentivized to practice playing the games with the promise that one day they may be able redeem those points or credits for better terms, or something else of value, received from the casino licensee.  This bill would make it unlawful for any casino licensee to engage in this practice.

STATEMENT Under this bill, a casino licensee, through its agents, employees, or any contracted operator, or any party with which the casino licensee has a relationship, to conduct a non-wagering casino game that provides a reward for immediate or continued participation or that serves to solicit future participation in wagering activities. As used in this bill, non-wagering casino game means any game, conducted in person or via the Internet, which offers participants an experience equivalent to, or with similar odds of winning as, a game that ordinarily requires a casino license to be conducted, except that the game does not require any initial monetary investment on behalf of the participants to play. This bill is intended to address a practice whereby casinos may engage with applications with games that simulate the experience of playing real casino games, but for fictitious points or credits rather than real world things of value.  The participants in these games, some of whom may be underage at the time, are incentivized to practice playing the games with the promise that one day they may be able redeem those points or credits for better terms, or something else of value, received from the casino licensee.  This bill would make it unlawful for any casino licensee to engage in this practice.
