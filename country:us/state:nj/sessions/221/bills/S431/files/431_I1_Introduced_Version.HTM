affordable housing obligations and amending P.L.1985, c.222.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-302) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The New Jersey Supreme
Court, through its rulings in South Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 67
N.J. 151 (1975) and South Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 92 N.J. 158
(1983), has determined that every municipality in a growth area has a constitutional
obligation to provide through its land use regulations a realistic opportunity
for a fair share of its region's present and prospective needs for housing for
low and moderate income families. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In the second Mount
Laurel ruling, the Supreme Court stated that the determination of the methods
for satisfying this constitutional obligation &quot;is better left to the
Legislature,&quot; that the court has &quot;always preferred legislative to
judicial action in their field,&quot; and that the judicial role in upholding
the Mount Laurel doctrine &quot;could decrease as a result of legislative and
executive action.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The interest of all
citizens, including low and moderate income families in need of affordable
housing, and the needs of the workforce, would be best served by a
comprehensive planning and implementation response to this constitutional
obligation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    There are a number of
essential ingredients to a comprehensive planning and implementation response,
including the establishment of reasonable fair share housing guidelines and
standards, the initial determination of fair share by officials at the
municipal level and the preparation of a municipal housing element, State
review of the local fair share study and housing element, and continuous State
funding for low and moderate income housing to replace the federal housing
subsidy programs which have been almost completely eliminated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The State can maximize
the number of low and moderate income units provided in New Jersey by allowing
its municipalities to adopt appropriate phasing schedules for meeting their
fair share, so long as the municipalities permit a timely achievement of an
appropriate fair share of the regional need for low and moderate income housing
as required by the Mt. Laurel I and II opinions and other relevant court
decisions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The State can also
maximize the number of low and moderate income units by creating new affordable
housing and by rehabilitating existing, but substandard, housing in the State. 
Because the Legislature has determined, pursuant to P.L.2008,
c.46&nbsp;(C.52:27D-329.1 et al.), that it is no longer appropriate or in
harmony with the Mount Laurel doctrine to permit the transfer of the fair share
obligations among municipalities within a housing region, it is necessary and
appropriate to create a new program to create new affordable housing and to
foster the rehabilitation of existing, but substandard, housing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Since the urban areas
are vitally important to the State, construction, conversion and rehabilitation
of housing in our urban centers should be encouraged.  However, the provision
of housing in urban areas must be balanced with the need to provide housing
throughout the State for the free mobility of citizens.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The Supreme Court of New
Jersey in its Mount Laurel decisions demands that municipal land use
regulations affirmatively afford a reasonable opportunity for a variety and
choice of housing including low and moderate cost housing, to meet the needs of
people desiring to live there.  While provision for the actual construction of
that housing by municipalities is not required, they are encouraged but not
mandated to expend their own resources to help provide low and moderate income
housing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Certain amendments to
the enabling act of the Council on Affordable Housing are necessary to provide
guidance to the council to ensure consistency with the legislative intent,
while at the same time clarifying the limitations of the council in its
rulemaking.  Although the court has remarked in several decisions that the
Legislature has granted the council considerable deference in its rulemaking,
the Legislature retains its power and obligation to clarify and amend the
enabling act from which the council derives its rulemaking power, from time to
time, in order to better guide the council.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>The
Legislature finds that the use of regional contribution agreements, which
permits municipalities to transfer a certain portion of their fair share
housing obligation outside of the municipal borders, should no longer be
utilized as a mechanism for the creation of affordable housing by the council.<b><span

such a realistic opportunity, and the municipality shall establish that its
land use and other relevant ordinances have been revised to incorporate the
provisions for low and moderate income housing.  In preparing the housing

low and moderate income housing within the municipality, as well as such other
techniques as may be published by the council or proposed by the municipality:</p>

veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as referenced in this
subsection, and who apply within 90 days of the initial marketing period shall
receive preference for the rental of the agreed-upon percentage of affordable
units.  After the first 90 days of the initial 120-day marketing period, if any
of those units subject to the preference remain available, then applicants from
the general public shall be considered for occupancy.  Following the initial
120-day marketing period, previously qualified applicants and future qualified

shall be given preference for affordable units, as the units become available,
whenever the percentage of preference-occupied units falls below the agreed
upon percentage.  Any agreement to provide affordable housing preferences for
veterans pursuant to this subsection shall not affect a municipality's ability
to receive credit for the unit from the council, or its successor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the Fair
Housing Act to re-authorize the use of regional contribution agreements (RCAs)
by municipalities to meet affordable housing needs, and establishes a role in
the approval process for the Department of Community Affairs (DCA), the
Commissioner or Community Affairs (commissioner), and the Attorney General. 
Since July 17, 2008, the effective date of P.L.2008, c.46, municipalities have
been prohibited from using RCAs to address fair share housing obligations. 
This bill would re-authorize a municipality to propose transferring up to 50%
of its fair share housing obligation to another municipality within its housing
region through an RCA.  This matches the portion of a fair share housing
obligation that had been transferrable prior to 2008.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would shift the role
in approving RCAs that has previously been provided to the Council on
Affordable Housing, giving this role instead to DCA.  After approval of an RCA
proposal by DCA, an approval determination signed by the commissioner, would be
submitted, along with the RCA proposal, to the Attorney General.  The bill
requires the Attorney General to also review the proposal to ensure that the
inclusionary requirements established by the Supreme Court in its Mount Laurel
decisions are not violated.  The bill would also require payments associated
with RCA agreements to be submitted by the sending municipality to DCA.  Before
the department forwards a payment to the receiving municipality, the payment
details would be reviewed and approved by the Attorney General.  </p>
