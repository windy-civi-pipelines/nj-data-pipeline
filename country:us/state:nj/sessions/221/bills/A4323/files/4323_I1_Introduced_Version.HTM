CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning pupil transportation and revising various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  N.J.S.18A:39-1 is amended to read as follows: 18A:39-1.  Whenever in any district there are elementary school pupils who live more than [two] 1 1/2 miles from their public school of attendance or secondary school pupils who live more than [2 1/2] 1 1/2 miles from their public school of attendance, the district shall provide transportation to and from school for these pupils. When any school district provides any transportation for public school pupils to and from school pursuant to this section, transportation shall be supplied to school pupils residing in such school district in going to and from any remote school other than a public school, not operated for profit in whole or in part, located within the State not more than 20 miles from the residence of the pupil; except that if the district is located in a county of the third class with a population of not less than 80,000 and not more than 120,000 transportation shall be provided to a nonpublic school located outside the State not more than 20 miles from the residence of the pupil, if there is no appropriate nonpublic school within the State located closer to the residence of the pupil; provided the per pupil cost of the lowest bid received does not exceed $675 for the 1992-93 school year or the amount determined for subsequent years pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1981, c.57 (C.18A:39-1a), and if such bid shall exceed that cost then the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the pupil shall be eligible to receive $675 for the 1992-93 school year or the amount determined pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1981, c.57 (C.18A:39-1a) for subsequent years toward the cost of his transportation to a qualified school other than a public school, regardless of whether such transportation is along established public school routes.  It shall be the obligation of the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the pupil attending a remote school, other than a public school, not operating for profit in whole or in part, to register said pupil with the office of the secretary of the board of education at the time and in the manner specified by rules and regulations of the State board in order to be eligible for the transportation provided by this section. If the registration of any such pupil is not completed by September 1 of the school year and if it is necessary for the board of education to enter into a contract establishing a new route in order to provide such transportation, then the board shall not be required to provide it, but in lieu thereof the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the pupil shall be eligible to receive $675 or the amount determined pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1981, c.57 (C.18A:39-1a), or an amount computed by multiplying 1/180 times the number of school days remaining in the school year at the time of registration, times $675 for the 1992-93 school year or the amount determined pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1981, c.57 (C.18A:39-1a) for subsequent years, whichever is the smaller amount.  Whenever any regional school district provides any transportation for pupils attending schools other than public schools pursuant to this section, said regional district shall assume responsibility for the transportation of all such pupils, and the cost of such transportation for pupils below the grade level for which the regional district was organized shall be prorated by the regional district among the constituent districts on a per pupil basis, after approval of such costs by the county superintendent.  This section shall not require school districts to provide any transportation for pupils attending a school other than a public school, where the only transportation presently provided by said district is for school children transported pursuant to chapter 46 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes or for pupils transported to a vocational, technical or other public school offering a specialized program. Any transportation to a school, other than a public school, shall be pursuant to the same rules and regulations promulgated by the State board as governs transportation to any public school. The board of education may make rules and contracts for the pupil transportation provided pursuant to this section. Nothing in this section shall be so construed as to prohibit a board of education from making contracts for the transportation of pupils to a school in an adjoining district, when such pupils are transferred to the district by order of the county superintendent, or when any pupils shall attend school in a district other than that in which they shall reside by virtue of an agreement made by the respective boards of education. Nothing herein contained shall limit or diminish in any way any of the provisions for transportation for children pursuant to chapter 46 of this Title. (cf: P.L.1992, c.33, s.1) 2.  Section 1 of P.L.2011, c.132 (C.18A:39-1c) is amended to read as follows: 1. a. Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.18A:39-1 or any other section of law to the contrary, a school district shall not be required to provide transportation services for the school year to an elementary school pupil who lives more than [two] 1 1/2 miles from his public school of attendance or to a secondary school pupil who lives more than [2 1/2] 1 1/2 miles from his public school of attendance if the pupil's parent or guardian signs a written statement that the pupil waives transportation services for that school year.  The written statement shall be in such form as determined by the Department of Education. b.    In the event that a parent or guardian signs a waiver pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the school district shall develop a policy for the provision of transportation services to the pupil in the case of a family or economic hardship. (cf: P.L.2011, c.132, s.1) 3.  Section 1 of P.L.2001, c.327 (C.18A:39-1.8) is amended to read as follows: 1.    Any board of education which transports pupils to and from school pursuant to N.J.S.18A:39-1 may provide, on a space-available basis, for the transportation of elementary school pupils who live less than [two] 1 1/2 miles from school and secondary school pupils who live less than [two  and a half] 1 1/2 miles from school along an established school bus route, and may require that if the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the child elects to have the pupil transported, the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the child shall pay all or a part of the costs of that transportation. A board of education may also provide, on a space-available basis, for the transportation of elementary school pupils who live less than [two] 1 1/2 miles and secondary school pupils who live less than [two and a half] 1 1/2 miles from any not for profit nonpublic school which satisfies the maximum distance requirements set forth in N.J.S.18A:39-1 along an established school bus route, and may require that if the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the child elects to have the pupil transported,  the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the child shall pay all or a part of the costs of that transportation.  The costs of the transportation shall be paid at the time and in the manner determined by the board of education, provided that the costs shall be equitable for both public and nonpublic pupils. A board of education shall notify the Department of Education when it elects to provide transportation for pupils under the provisions of this act. (cf: P.L.2001, c.327, s.1) 4.  Section 9 of P.L.2010, c.65 (C.18A:36B-22) is amended to read as follows: 9. a. Transportation, or aid in-lieu-of transportation, shall be provided to an elementary school pupil who lives more than [two] 1 1/2 miles from the choice district school of attendance and to a secondary school pupil who lives more than [two and one-half] 1 1/2 miles from the choice district school of attendance, provided the choice district school is not more than 20 miles from the residence of the pupil.  Transportation, or aid in-lieu-of transportation, shall be the responsibility of the sending district.  The choice district and the sending district may enter into a shared service agreement in accordance with the "Uniform Shared Services and Consolidation Act," sections 1 through 35 of P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A:65-1 through C.40A:65-35). b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 20 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-62) to the contrary, the sending district shall receive State aid for transportation calculated pursuant to section 15 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-57) for a student transported or receiving aid-in-lieu-of transportation pursuant to subsection a. of this section. (cf: P.L.2010, c.65, s.9) 5.  This act shall take effect in the first full school year following the date of enactment. STATEMENT Under current law, a school district is required to provide transportation to elementary school students who live more than two miles from their public school of attendance and to high school students who live more than two and one-half miles from their public school of attendance.  This bill would amend current law to require a school district to provide transportation to students in elementary school and high school who live more than one and one-half miles from their public school of attendance.  The change in the mileage limitation also impacts nonpublic school students who reside in school districts that are required to provide pupil transportation. The bill also amends the transportation eligibility criteria under the Interdistrict Public School Choice Program Act to align with the mileage change made by the bill.
