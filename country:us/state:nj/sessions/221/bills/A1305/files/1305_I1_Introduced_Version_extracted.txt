STATEMENT This bill requires the Commissioner of Community Affairs to establish certification courses for planning professionals on the development of warehouses and high-density buildings. The bill requires the Department of Community Affairs to develop and offer optional certification courses for planning professionals on current topics and issues relating to the development of warehouses and high density buildings. The courses are to be developed in conjunction with institutions of higher education, the State Planning Commission, and non-profit organizations representing planning associations and include modules specifically on warehouse development and high-density development. Additionally, the bill specifies that these optional courses offered to planning professionals do not meet the land use law and planning course requirement for planning board and zoning board members required pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law. Local planners are crucial in leading a community in its development and implementation of the Master Plan. It is the sponsors intent to give planners additional tools to provide leadership to their communities. Warehouse construction has become a leading concern among both the public and local government officials. Many communities feel overwhelmed by the size and consequences of high-density development. Providing planning professionals with greater and up to date information will better allow them to serve their communities and local officials.
