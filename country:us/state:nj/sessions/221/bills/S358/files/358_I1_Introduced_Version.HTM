utilizing the criteria set forth herein.  In addition to any civil
administrative penalty assessed under this subsection and notwithstanding the
$25,000 maximum penalty set forth above, the commissioner may assess any
economic benefits from the violation gained by the violator.  Prior to
assessment of a penalty under this subsection, the owner or operator of the

or personal service that the penalty is being assessed.  The notice shall:
include a reference to the section of the statute or regulation violated;
recite the facts alleged to constitute a violation; state the basis for the
