STATEMENT This bill concerns various railroad safety provisions, including requiring: certain actions to be taken if a high hazard train experiences a discharge, limits on train length, and installation and review of wayside detector systems. Following a discharge that requires emergency response action, the owner or operator of a high hazard train is required to meet certain milestones at certain time periods. Under the bill, the owner or operator of a high hazard train is to require at least a two person crew on all high hazard trains. The owner or operator of a high hazard train is to further require that all high hazard trains clearly display the name of the rail company that owns the high hazard train. Whenever, on the basis of available information, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection (commissioner) finds that the owner or operator of a high hazard train is in violation of the provisions this bill, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, the commissioner may levy a civil administrative penalty or bring an action for a civil penalty.  The commissioner is authorized to assess a civil administrative penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation, and each day during which each violation continues will constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense. The owner or operator of a high hazard train that experiences a discharge is also subject to penalty and injunctive relief provisions under the Spill Compensation and Control Act. The bill also prohibits any railroad company, including a short line, from operating any train that exceeds 8,500 feet in length on any main line or branch line, within the State. Any person or railroad company found to be in violation will be liable for a civil penalty of at least $500 but not more than $1,000 per foot over the maximum train length allowed under the bill, though the penalty is increased in instances of gross negligence or repeat violations that cause an imminent hazard of death or injury or has caused death or injury. In accordance with federal regulations, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection is required to, at least annually, request from the United States Secretary of Transportation a copy of the most recent bridge inspection report for every bridge owned by a railroad or upon which a railroad is located. The commissioner is required to submit any bridge inspection report, acquired by the department, to the Governor and Legislature. Under the bill, the Board of Public Utilities (board), in conjunction with the New Jersey Department of Transportation is required to work with each railroad company that operates in the State to ensure that wayside detector systems are installed and are operating along railroad tracks on which the railroad operates and to ensure that such systems meet certain standards. If a railroad company refuses to work or otherwise cooperate with the board and the Department of Transportation in good faith, the board and the Department of Transportation are required to investigate the railroad companys safety practices and standards to determine whether the company appears to be in compliance with federal railroad safety standards.  If the railroad company does not appear to be in compliance, the board and the Department of Transportation are then required to make a report to the Federal Railroad Administration (administration) detailing the results of the investigation and recommending that the administration take enforcement action in accordance with its authority against the railroad company for the safety violations discovered through the investigation. The bill requires the board and the Department of Transportation to send a copy of the report to the Governor and Legislature.

If a hearing is not requested, the notice shall become a final order after the expiration of the 35 calendar day period.  Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order.  The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement provisions in P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this subsection in an amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate.  A civil administrative penalty assessed, including a portion thereof required to be paid pursuant to a payment schedule approved by the department, which is not paid within 90 days of the date that payment of the penalty is due, shall be subject to an interest charge on the amount of the penalty, or portion thereof, which shall accrue as of the date payment is due.  If the penalty is contested, an additional interest charge shall not accrue on the amount of the penalty until 90 days after the date on which a final order is issued.  Interest charges assessed and collectible pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the rate of interest on judgments provided in the New Jersey Rules of Court. c.     Any owner or operator of a high hazard train who violates the provisions of P.L.      , c. (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or who fails to pay in full a civil administrative penalty levied pursuant to subsection b. of this section, or who fails to make a payment pursuant to a penalty payment schedule entered into with the department, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement, representation, or certification on any application, record, report, or other document required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each day during which the violation continues.  Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected, and any costs incurred in connection therewith may be recovered, in a summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  In addition to any penalties, costs or interest charges, the court may assess against the violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the violation. The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction to enforce the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.). d.    The owner or operator of a high hazard train that experiences a discharge shall be subject to the penalty and injunctive relief  provisions of section 22 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11u). 5.    a. No railroad company, including a short line, operating within this State on any main line or branch line shall operate, or permit to be operated, on any part of a main line or branch line, any train which exceeds 8,500 feet in length. b.    Notwithstanding section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): (1)   a person or railroad violating any provision of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty.  Any civil penalty imposed may be collected, and any costs incurred in connection therewith may be recovered, in a summary proceeding pursuant to the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction to enforce the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.). (2)   the amount of the civil penalty shall be at least $500 but not more than $1,000 per foot over the maximum train length provided in subsection a. of this section; provided that, when a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has caused an imminent hazard of death or injury to individuals or has caused death or injury, the amount of the civil penalty shall be not more than $250,000, regardless of the length of the train. 6.    The provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not apply to the owner or operator of a Class III carrier, as defined by the Surface Transportation Board pursuant to 49 C.F.R. Part 1201 1-1, that operates within a single municipality on not more than 25 total track miles and is engaged in switching or terminal railroad services. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to exempt a major facility from the provisions of the Spill Compensation and Control Act, P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11 et seq.). 7.    In accordance with the federal regulations promulgated pursuant to section 11405 of the federal Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act, Pub.L.114-94, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall, at least annually and whenever the Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall deem necessary, request from the United States Secretary of Transportation a copy of the most recent bridge inspection report generated pursuant to the federal Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act, Pub.L.114-94, for every bridge owned by a railroad or upon which a railroad is located. The Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall submit any bridge inspection report, acquired by the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to this section, to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature. 8.    a. The Board of Public Utilities in conjunction with the New Jersey Department of Transportation shall work with each railroad company that operates a train in the State to ensure that wayside detector systems are installed and are operating along railroad tracks on which the railroad operates and to ensure that such systems meet all of the following standards: (1)   the wayside detector systems are properly installed, maintained, repaired, and operational in accordance with the latest guidelines issued by the United States Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, and the Association of American Railroads; (2)   any expired, nonworking, or outdated wayside detector system or component parts of a system are removed and replaced with new parts or an entirely new system that reflects the current best practices and standards of the industry; (3)   the railroad company has defined, written standards and training for its employees pertaining to wayside detector system defect alerts, the course of action that employees are required to take to respond to an alert, and appropriate monitoring and responses by the company if employees fail to take the required course of action; and (4)   the distance between wayside detector systems is appropriate when accounting for the natural terrain surrounding the railroad track on which the railroad operates and the safety of the trains, rolling stock, on-track equipment, their operators, their passengers, and the persons and property in the vicinity of such railroad track so that if defects are detected operators have sufficient time to do the following: (a)   respond to the alerts projected by the wayside detector system; (b)   stop the train, rolling stock, or on-track equipment, if necessary; and (c)   make all necessary repairs or, if repair is impossible at the location, to remove the component parts or equipment that is defective. b.    If a railroad company refuses to work or otherwise cooperate with the board and the New Jersey Department of Transportation in good faith in accordance with this section, the board and the Department of Transportation shall investigate the railroad companys safety practices and standards. The board and the Department of Transportation shall determine whether the company appears to be in compliance with federal railroad safety standards, as defined in 49 C.F.R. Part 209. c.     (1) If the board and the Department of Transportation determine that a railroad company does not appear to be in compliance with the applicable federal standards pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the board and the Department of Transportation shall make a report to the Federal Railroad Administration within 60 days of making the determination pursuant to subsection b. of this section. The report shall detail the results of the investigation and recommend that the administration take enforcement action in accordance with its authority against the railroad company for the safety violations discovered through that investigation. (2)   The board and the New Jersey Department of Transportation shall send a copy of the report to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature. 9.    a.  The Department of Environmental Protection shall adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to effectuate the purposes of sections 2 through 4 and section 7 of this act within 18 months. b.    The Board of Public Utilities, in conjunction with the Department of Transportation shall adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to effectuate the purposes of section 8 of this act within 18 months. 10.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill concerns various railroad safety provisions, including requiring: certain actions to be taken if a high hazard train experiences a discharge, limits on train length, and installation and review of wayside detector systems. Following a discharge that requires emergency response action, the owner or operator of a high hazard train is required to meet certain milestones at certain time periods. Under the bill, the owner or operator of a high hazard train is to require at least a two person crew on all high hazard trains. The owner or operator of a high hazard train is to further require that all high hazard trains clearly display the name of the rail company that owns the high hazard train. Whenever, on the basis of available information, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection (commissioner) finds that the owner or operator of a high hazard train is in violation of the provisions this bill, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, the commissioner may levy a civil administrative penalty or bring an action for a civil penalty.  The commissioner is authorized to assess a civil administrative penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation, and each day during which each violation continues will constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense. The owner or operator of a high hazard train that experiences a discharge is also subject to penalty and injunctive relief provisions under the Spill Compensation and Control Act. The bill also prohibits any railroad company, including a short line, from operating any train that exceeds 8,500 feet in length on any main line or branch line, within the State. Any person or railroad company found to be in violation will be liable for a civil penalty of at least $500 but not more than $1,000 per foot over the maximum train length allowed under the bill, though the penalty is increased in instances of gross negligence or repeat violations that cause an imminent hazard of death or injury or has caused death or injury. In accordance with federal regulations, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection is required to, at least annually, request from the United States Secretary of Transportation a copy of the most recent bridge inspection report for every bridge owned by a railroad or upon which a railroad is located. The commissioner is required to submit any bridge inspection report, acquired by the department, to the Governor and Legislature. Under the bill, the Board of Public Utilities (board), in conjunction with the New Jersey Department of Transportation is required to work with each railroad company that operates in the State to ensure that wayside detector systems are installed and are operating along railroad tracks on which the railroad operates and to ensure that such systems meet certain standards. If a railroad company refuses to work or otherwise cooperate with the board and the Department of Transportation in good faith, the board and the Department of Transportation are required to investigate the railroad companys safety practices and standards to determine whether the company appears to be in compliance with federal railroad safety standards.  If the railroad company does not appear to be in compliance, the board and the Department of Transportation are then required to make a report to the Federal Railroad Administration (administration) detailing the results of the investigation and recommending that the administration take enforcement action in accordance with its authority against the railroad company for the safety violations discovered through the investigation. The bill requires the board and the Department of Transportation to send a copy of the report to the Governor and Legislature.
