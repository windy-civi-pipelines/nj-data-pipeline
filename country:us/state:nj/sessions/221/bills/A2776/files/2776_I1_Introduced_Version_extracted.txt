(cf: P.L.2003, c.231, s.1) 2.    (New section)  a.  (1) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (2) of this subsection, plastic materials that are transported and delivered to, and processed at, an advanced plastic processing facility shall not be subject to the provisions of any State law regulating recycling or the disposal of solid waste, including, but not limited to, the "Solid Waste Management Act," P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.) and the "New Jersey Statewide Mandatory Source Separation and Recycling Act," P.L.1987, c.102 (C.13:1E-99.11 et al.), or any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto.  However, an advanced plastic processing facility shall be subject to all other applicable State and federal laws, including, but not limited to, those regulating land use, air pollution, and water pollution.  In particular, nothing in this act shall be construed to exempt an advanced plastic processing facility from the provisions of P.L.2020, c.92 (C.13:1D-157 et seq.). (2)  The exemption from solid waste disposal and recycling requirements, which is established by paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not apply to plastic materials that are composed of polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) or high density polyethylene (HDPE) and are labeled with material code 1 or 2 pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1989, c.268 (C.13:1E-99.41). b.  Advanced plastic processing shall not be considered solid waste disposal, solid waste management, resource recovery, materials recovery, thermal destruction, incineration, combustion, treatment, or reclamation, for the purposes of any State law regulating recycling or the disposal of solid waste or any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto. c.  An advanced plastic processing facility shall not be considered a solid waste facility, solid waste disposal facility, solid waste management facility, resource recovery facility, materials recovery facility, thermal destruction facility, incinerator, combustion facility, treatment facility, reclamation facility, recycling facility, or recycling center for the purposes of any State law regulating recycling or the disposal of solid waste or any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto. d.  As used in this section: "Advanced plastic processing" means the transformation of plastic material generated from industrial, commercial, agricultural, or domestic activities into useable products, including, but not limited to, plastic monomers, chemicals, waxes, lubricants, chemical feedstocks, crude oil, diesel, gasoline, or home heating oil, using chemical processes such as gasification, pyrolysis, and solvolysis. "Advanced plastic processing facility" means the same as the term is defined in section 3 of P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-3). 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would exempt plastic material transported and delivered to, and processed at, an advanced plastic processing facility from State laws regulating the disposal or recycling of solid waste.  However, the bill would provide that advanced plastic processing facilities are subject to all other State and federal laws, including environmental laws.  The bill would also provide that the terms "advanced plastic processing" and "advanced plastic processing facility" are distinct from various other terms related to solid waste, as described in section 2 of the bill. The bill would also amend the definition of "solid waste" in the "Solid Waste Management Act" (SWMA), P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), to exclude source separated plastic material that is transported and delivered to, and processed at, an advanced plastic processing facility.  The bill would thus exclude this type of plastic from the substantive provisions of the SWMA, which, among other things, gives the Department of Environmental Protection the authority to regulate solid waste collection, transportation, and disposal. The bill would define an "advanced plastic processing facility" as a facility that receives, stores, and processes plastic material generated from industrial, commercial, agricultural, or domestic activities, transforming it into useable products, including but not limited to plastic monomers, chemicals, waxes, lubricants, chemical feedstocks, crude oil, diesel, gasoline, or home heating oil, using chemical processes such as gasification, pyrolysis, and solvolysis.
