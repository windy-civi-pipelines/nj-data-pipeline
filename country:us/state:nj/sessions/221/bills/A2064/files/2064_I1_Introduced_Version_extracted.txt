A primary care provider shall include general or family practitioners, pediatricians, internists, and shall include specialist physicians, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives, certified nurse practitioners, or clinical nurse specialists, provided that the practitioner carries out all primary care provider responsibilities in accordance with licensure requirements. 2.    A managed care organization that provides benefits to persons who are eligible for Medicaid under P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.) or NJ FamilyCare under P.L.2005, c.156 (C.30:4J-8 et al.) shall offer a patient-centered medical home model to primary care providers in the managed care organizations network.  The division, in its sole discretion, may waive the requirements of this section if a managed care organization can demonstrate that the managed care organization offers an alternative payment model to primary care providers that is not a patient-centered medical home model but that similarly incentivizes high quality, efficient, and holistic care. 3.    a.  A managed care organization shall submit annually to the division a description of the managed care organizations patient-centered medical home model or, if waived by the division to offer a patient-centered medical home model, the other alternative payment model offered to primary care providers, which description shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   the basic financial structure of the  model, which shall include incentive or population management payments which may be available to providers participating in the  model; (2)   whether participating providers are required to obtain any certifications to participate in the model; (3)   quality or other performance metrics which affect provider payment under the alternative payment model; (4)   the requirements for a provider to be eligible to participate in the  model, including but not limited to the number of unique patients seen by a provider or past quality performance; (5)   whether the  model qualifies as an Other Payer Advanced APM as defined in 42 CFR 414.1305; (6)   a list of all providers participating in the  model; and (7)   the number of enrollees provided services by  providers participating in the model, listed by county. b.    The managed care organization shall make the description required pursuant to subsection a. of this section available to the public on the managed care organizations Internet website, after division approval. The division may also post such descriptions on its Internet website. c.     The division may, in its discretion, establish a standardized format for managed care organizations to use in providing the description required pursuant to subsection a. of this section. d.    The division may, in its discretion, extend the requirements of subsection a. of this section to any other alternative payment models, which are targeted toward non-primary care provider categories, offered by a managed care organization that contracts to provide benefits to persons eligible for Medicaid or NJ FamilyCare. 4.    a. Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) or any other law to the contrary, the division shall establish standardized quality metrics for patient-centered medical home models and other alternative payment models offered to primary care providers in accordance with this section. b.  The division shall develop, through a public stakeholder process, standardized quality metrics for patient-centered medical home models and other alternative payment models offered to primary care providers and request public comment on such standardized quality metrics. c      Following the public comment period, and periodically thereafter, the division shall identify a list of standardized quality metrics and shall mandate that managed care organizations utilize only those standardized quality metrics when determining or calculating payments to providers under the managed care organizations patient-centered medical home model or other alternative payment offered to primary care providers.  To the extent practicable, the standardized quality metrics shall promote alignment with other non-Medicaid payers. d.    Nothing in this act shall be construed as precluding the division from imposing additional requirements on managed care organizations that relate to patient-center medical home models or other alternative payment models offered to primary care providers. 5.    The division shall specify a format and methodology through which managed care organizations shall submit patient-level data and provider-level data on participation and performance in a patient-centered medical home model or other alternative payment model in order to facilitate the divisions evaluation of the performance of such patient-centered medical home models and alternative payment models offered to primary care providers. 6.    The Commissioner of Human Services and the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance may jointly waive any provision of P.L.1999, c.409 (C.17:48H-1 et seq.) to the extent necessary to support provider participation in Medicaid patient-care medical home models or any other Medicaid alternative payment models.  Such waivers shall be granted, in writing, by both commissioners and shall only be issued if the Commissioner of Human Services and the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance jointly determine, in their sole discretion, that any risk of adverse consequences to the public are minimal. 7.    The Commissioner of Human Services shall apply for such waivers, federal approvals, or state plan amendments as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act and to secure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program. 8.    This act shall take effect one year following the date of enactment provided that approval of any waivers, federal approvals, or state plan amendments has been received prior to that date, otherwise the effective date of this act is delayed until such approvals are received.
