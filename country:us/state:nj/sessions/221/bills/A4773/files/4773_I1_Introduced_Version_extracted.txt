Due to the inclusion of illegal aliens in the federal census counts, the legal residents in congressional, state legislative, and local districts with low numbers of illegal aliens are unjustly punished in their political representation when compared to districts with high numbers of illegal aliens. e.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, the data prepared by the Secretary of State under section 4 of P.L.2019, c.385 (C.52:4-1.4), together with data provided by the Census Bureau pursuant to Pub.L.94-171 (13 U.S.C. s.141), shall be adjusted by the secretary to exclude the population of illegal aliens in this State.

As part of the methodology for the data adjustment required by this section, the secretary shall develop an accurate count of the legal population residing in this State, drawing from a variety of available datasets concerning a persons legal status, citizenship status, and residency. The datasets shall include, but may not be limited to: (1) United States Bureau of the Census data regarding citizenship status and legal status; (2) New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission data regarding applications for motor vehicle driver's licenses, examination permits, probationary driver's licenses, and non-driver identification cards, and each related update, renewal, or change of address, and the issuance of such licenses, permits, and cards in cases where the applicant does not provide a social security number or individual taxpayer identification number; and (3) any other data available from reliable governmental sources deemed appropriate by the secretary for this purpose. c.
