SCR23 SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION No. 23 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  JAMES W. HOLZAPFEL District 10 (Monmouth and Ocean) SYNOPSIS Urges US Congress to pass legislation to reinstate service members discharged for refusing COVID-19 vaccine. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Concurrent Resolution urging the United States Congress to pass H.R.7570 establishing certain protections for individuals involuntarily separated from the United States Armed Forces solely on the basis of refusing to receive vaccinations against COVID-19. Whereas, In 2021 the Biden administration announced that members of the United States Armed Forces were required to be vaccinated against COVID-19; and Whereas, After refusing to receive the vaccine, some members of the Armed Forces were disciplined and were discharged from the Armed Forces; and Whereas, In some cases, the discharges received were general discharges under honorable conditions rather than honorable discharges, diminishing the contributions individuals have made to protect our country, possibly damaging their records, and possibly reducing their eligibility for certain benefits; and Whereas, United States House of Representatives Bill No.7570 was introduced by Representative Christopher H. Smith of this State on April 25, 2022 in order to rectify the injustice faced by the discharged service members; and Whereas, Through the legislation a service member has the opportunity to be reinstated to the United States Armed Forces, to change their discharge characterization, and ensure their access to retired pay and benefits; and Whereas, New Jersey is grateful for the sacrifices that members of the military have made in service to this nation and honors the importance of continuing to recognize those contributions through respect for individual choices; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey (the General Assembly concurring): 1. The Legislature of the State of New Jersey respectfully urges the United States Congress to pass H.R.7570. 2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, the Majority and Minority Leaders in the United States Senate, and every member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution urges the United States Congress to pass H.R.7570, which would establish certain protections for individuals involuntarily separated from the United States Armed Forces solely on the basis of refusing to receive vaccinations against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccinations became mandatory for members of the Armed Forces in 2021.  Those service members who did not wish to receive a vaccine were discharged, in some cases with a general discharge under honorable conditions.  These discharges may create issues for future employment and minimize the contribution and commitment made by members of the United States Armed Forces. H.R.7570 would reinstate service members to their previous rank and grade, upon their request and change the discharge of an individual to honorable.  New Jersey recognizes the contributions of members of the Armed Forces and the importance of their service to our nation.
