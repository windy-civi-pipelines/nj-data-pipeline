(4)   The division shall establish a process by which a patient may request that the patients prescription monitoring information include an indication that the patient should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a significant potential for abuse or addiction.  The indication shall not be included in the patients prescription monitoring information except at the patients request. The division shall establish a process for removing the indication that a patient should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a significant potential for abuse or addiction, at the patients request.  The division shall also establish a method, for persons who indicate that they should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a significant potential for abuse or addiction, to communicate this preference, in the event that the person is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate this preference prior to or while receiving health care services.  The division shall develop an education and outreach program for health care providers concerning the provisions of this paragraph. p.    The division shall take steps to ensure that appropriate channels of communication exist to enable any licensed health care professional, licensed pharmacist, mental health practitioner, pharmacy permit holder, or other practitioner who has online access to the Prescription Monitoring Program pursuant to this section to seek or provide information to the division related to the provisions of this section. q. (1) The division may make prescription monitoring information available on electronic systems that collect and display health information, such as an electronic system that connects hospital emergency departments for the purpose of transmitting and obtaining patient health data from multiple sources , or an electronic system that notifies practitioners of information pertaining to the treatment of overdoses ; provided that the division determines that any such electronic system has appropriate security protections in place. (2)   Practitioners who are required to access prescription monitoring information pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2015, c.74 (C.45:1-46.1) may discharge that responsibility by accessing one or more authorized electronic systems into which the prescription monitoring information maintained by the division has been integrated. (cf: P.L.2017, c.341, s.3) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety to establish a process by which a patient may request that the patients prescription monitoring information include an indication that the patient should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a significant potential for abuse or addiction.  The indication would not be included in the patients prescription monitoring information except at the patients request. The division would establish a process for removing the indication that a patient should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a significant potential for abuse or addiction, at the patients request.  The division would also establish a method, for persons who indicate that they should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a significant potential for abuse or addiction, to communicate this preference, in the event that the person is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate this preference prior to or while receiving health care services.  The division would develop an education and outreach program for health care providers concerning this process. It is the sponsors belief that permitting patients to indicate that they should not be prescribed opioids and certain other controlled substances will facilitate the recovery process, help patients maintain sobriety, help avoid the issuance of prescriptions for drugs that could jeopardize the patients recovery, and assist health care practitioners to identify patients who are at risk of abusing or diverting prescription medications.

STATEMENT This bill requires the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety to establish a process by which a patient may request that the patients prescription monitoring information include an indication that the patient should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a significant potential for abuse or addiction.  The indication would not be included in the patients prescription monitoring information except at the patients request. The division would establish a process for removing the indication that a patient should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a significant potential for abuse or addiction, at the patients request.  The division would also establish a method, for persons who indicate that they should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a significant potential for abuse or addiction, to communicate this preference, in the event that the person is incapacitated or otherwise unable to communicate this preference prior to or while receiving health care services.  The division would develop an education and outreach program for health care providers concerning this process. It is the sponsors belief that permitting patients to indicate that they should not be prescribed opioids and certain other controlled substances will facilitate the recovery process, help patients maintain sobriety, help avoid the issuance of prescriptions for drugs that could jeopardize the patients recovery, and assist health care practitioners to identify patients who are at risk of abusing or diverting prescription medications.
