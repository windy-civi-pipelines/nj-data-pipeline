The landowner shall be provided with the values determined pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, and if applicable, the value determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.  The higher of the values shall be utilized by the committee, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization as the basis for negotiation with the landowner with respect to the acquisition price.  A landowner may waive any of the requirements of this subsection and may agree to sell the lands for less than the values determined pursuant to this subsection. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the committee shall, immediately upon filing proper notice with the Office of Administrative Law, adopt rules and regulations to establish the Statewide Farmland Preservation Formula required pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection e. of this section.  The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be in effect for a period not to exceed three years after the date of the filing.  These rules and regulations shall thereafter be adopted, amended, or readopted by the committee in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (cf:  P.L.2023, c.245, s.2) 5.  There is appropriated from the General Fund to the Garden State Preservation Trust the sum of $150,000 in order to implement the provisions of section 1 of this act. 6.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would direct the Garden State Preservation Trust (GSPT) to perform, or cause to be performed, a comprehensive audit of the programs and accounts overseen by the GSPT, including the Green Acres program, Blue Acres program, farmland preservation program, and historic property preservation program.  The audit would be required to provide a formal accounting of the programs overseen by the GSPT, identify any inefficiencies in the programs, and recommend a reallocation of funds where appropriate. The bill would also amend existing law to authorize local governments and nonprofit organizations that receive constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues for farmland preservation purposes to use a certain portion of the funds for administrative expenses.  Specifically, the bill would authorize those entities to use up to three percent of the value of the development easement or fee simple title, as applicable, of the property for administrative expenses. Finally, the bill would provide that any moneys that have been allocated to a local government from the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund, which are not specifically committed to an active transaction 18 months after the date on which they were allocated, would be required to be returned to the fund.

The landowner shall be provided with the values determined pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, and if applicable, the value determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.  The higher of the values shall be utilized by the committee, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization as the basis for negotiation with the landowner with respect to the acquisition price.  A landowner may waive any of the requirements of this subsection and may agree to sell the lands for less than the values determined pursuant to this subsection. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the committee shall, immediately upon filing proper notice with the Office of Administrative Law, adopt rules and regulations to establish the Statewide Farmland Preservation Formula required pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection e. of this section.  The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall be in effect for a period not to exceed three years after the date of the filing.  These rules and regulations shall thereafter be adopted, amended, or readopted by the committee in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (cf:  P.L.2023, c.245, s.2) 5.  There is appropriated from the General Fund to the Garden State Preservation Trust the sum of $150,000 in order to implement the provisions of section 1 of this act. 6.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would direct the Garden State Preservation Trust (GSPT) to perform, or cause to be performed, a comprehensive audit of the programs and accounts overseen by the GSPT, including the Green Acres program, Blue Acres program, farmland preservation program, and historic property preservation program.  The audit would be required to provide a formal accounting of the programs overseen by the GSPT, identify any inefficiencies in the programs, and recommend a reallocation of funds where appropriate. The bill would also amend existing law to authorize local governments and nonprofit organizations that receive constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues for farmland preservation purposes to use a certain portion of the funds for administrative expenses.  Specifically, the bill would authorize those entities to use up to three percent of the value of the development easement or fee simple title, as applicable, of the property for administrative expenses. Finally, the bill would provide that any moneys that have been allocated to a local government from the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund, which are not specifically committed to an active transaction 18 months after the date on which they were allocated, would be required to be returned to the fund.
