(cf: P.L.2005, c.154, s.26) 2. R.S.19:34-15 is amended to read as follows: 19:34-15.  If a person shall distribute or display any circular or printed matter or offer any suggestion or solicit any support for any candidate, party or public question within the polling place or room or within a distance of 100 feet of the outside entrance to such polling place or room, or within 100 feet of a ballot drop box in use during the conduct of an election, or within 25 feet of a voter waiting in line in an area that is farther than 100 feet from the polling place or ballot drop box, the person shall be guilty of a disorderly persons offense.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.459, s.5) 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Current law prohibits electioneering inside a polling place and within 100 feet of the outside entrance of a polling place or within 100 feet of a ballot drop box. Electioneering consists of distributing or displaying circular or printed materials that offer suggestions about how to vote or which solicit support for a candidate, party, or public question. This bill expands current law to prohibit electioneering within 25 feet of a person waiting in line in an area that is farther than 100 feet from the polling place or ballot drop box. Current law also prohibits the following actions, which constitute crimes of the third degree: (1)   tampering, defacing, or interfering with any polling booth; (2)   obstructing or interfering with any voter, or loitering in or near a polling place; and (3)   spending an inordinate amount of time in the polling booth. This bill expands current law to also apply such prohibited actions to ballot drop boxes. Current law also classifies electioneering as crime of the third degree in R.S.19:34-6, but as a disorderly persons offense in R.S.19:34-15.  This bill provides for consistency in the law and makes electioneering a disorderly persons offense. The bill clarifies that the provisions concerning electioneering within 25 feet of a person waiting in line at a polling place or ballot drop box or in an area that is farther than 100 feet thereof would not be construed to prohibit: (1) the placement of newspaper racks or vending machines, or other newspaper sales or dissemination sites, including home delivery sites, that distribute or display printed matter; or (2) the provision of nonpartisan voter assistance to persons waiting in line, provided that such assistance does not involve support for, or opposition against, any candidate, party, or public question. The bill specifies that these exempted activities concerning newspapers and voter assistance, as described under (1) and (2) above, would not be construed to be a violation of the bill.
