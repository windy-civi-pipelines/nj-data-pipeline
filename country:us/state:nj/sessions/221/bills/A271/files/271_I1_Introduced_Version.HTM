(2)   If the victim or witness is under the age of 18 at the time of the court proceedings, any recording of the audio portion of the closed circuit testimony shall not constitute part of the record on appeal and shall be deemed confidential and not available to the public, unless the court orders otherwise for good cause shown upon motion of the parties. In making the determination regarding the availability of the audio portion of the testimony, the court shall consider potential trauma or stigma to the victim or witness.  A transcript of the audio portion of the closed circuit testimony shall constitute part of the record on appeal, subject to any personal identification safeguards contained in section 1 of P.L.1989, c.336 (C.2A:82-46). f.     For purposes of this section, "closed circuit television" means any closed-circuit, videoconferencing or other audio-visual electronic technology capable of producing a simultaneous, one-way broadcast from a victim or witness to a defendant in a separate physical location.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.205, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would permit all victims and witnesses of human trafficking to testify in criminal proceedings via closed circuit television.  Under current law, victims and witnesses of human trafficking involving sexual activity, among others, are permitted to testify via closed circuit television.  Also under current law, the victim or witness, the prosecutor, or the defendant or their counsel may make a motion seeking closed circuit testimony.  The bill would also permit a trial judge to make a motion.
