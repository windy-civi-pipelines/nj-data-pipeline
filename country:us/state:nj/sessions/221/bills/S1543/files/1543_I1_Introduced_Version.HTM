supplementing chapters 22 and 36A of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.   The board of
education of a Type I school district shall establish a citizen budget
oversight committee.  The committee shall act as an advisor to the board of
education and work with the board to monitor the financial position of the
school district.  The committee shall have access to financial documents and
financial information of the school district that are relevant to the financial
position of the school district, subject to redaction of information deemed to
be confidential for the purposes of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The committees
responsibilities shall include, but need not be limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Reviewing the school
districts revenues and expenditures on a monthly basis with the school
business administrator and reporting monthly to the entire board of education
on the financial status of the district and the committees activities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   At the discretion of the
committee or at the request of a majority of the board of education, providing
a review, analysis, and recommendations regarding special district initiatives
or the school district budget;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Reviewing the school
districts recommended school tax levy; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Making information
requests to the board of education through a person designated by the board to
be its committee liaison.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The citizen budget
oversight committee shall consist of at least five members, including parents
with students enrolled in the school district, educators residing in the school
district, and taxpayers residing in the school district.  To the extent
feasible, at least two of the members shall have the educational or vocational
expertise to review financial statements.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The board of education shall
post membership openings for the citizen budget oversight committee on the
school districts website and in a prominent location in each school building
at least 15 working days prior to the start of the selection process.  The
board of education shall designate a selection committee comprised of two
educators from the school district, one of whom shall be a teacher, a member of
the board of education, and at least two parents or community members who are not
school district employees or members of the board of education.  The selection
committee shall evaluate applications submitted by individuals seeking
appointment to the citizen budget oversight committee and, using a rubric
designated by the Department of Education, identify individuals for the citizen
budget oversight committee.  The individuals identified by the selection
committee shall be presented to the board of education for approval at a
regular meeting of the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Department of Education shall
develop a model application form for membership on the citizen budget oversight
committee, which shall be made available to all Type I school districts.  The
model membership application form shall include, but need not be limited to,
the following information:  name and address; identification of any potential
conflicts of interest; educational background; experience; and a statement of
interest for participation on the committee.  The school district may include
on its application form requests for additional information that it deems
appropriate for evaluating individuals interested in becoming members of the
committee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A member of the citizen
budget oversight committee shall serve for a term of two years and until his
successor is appointed, except that the members first appointed shall serve for
staggered terms determined by the board of education.  An individuals
appointment to the committee may be terminated by the board of education for an
identified conflict of interest, a lack of participation, or any other act
deemed by the board of education as detrimental to the successful support of
the district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The citizen budget
oversight committee shall select, by a majority vote of the members of the
committee, a chairperson, co-chairperson, and recording secretary from among
its members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Members of the citizen
budget oversight committee shall serve without compensation, but shall be
eligible for reimbursement for necessary and reasonable expenses incurred in
the performance of their official duties, within the limits of funds
appropriated or otherwise made available to the committee for its purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Each new member of the
citizen budget oversight committee shall complete a training program developed
by the Department of Education within the first two months of the members
first term.  The training program shall, at a minimum, consist of two hours and
cover the following topics: an overview of the school district budget process
and timelines; instruction in the basic rules of budgeting, including State
funds, local funds, and federal funds; and reporting requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.     The board of
trustees of a charter school shall establish a citizen budget oversight
committee.  The committee shall act as an advisor to the board of trustees and
work with the board to monitor the financial position of the charter school. 
The committee shall have access to financial documents and financial
information of the charter school that are relevant to the financial position
of the charter school, subject to redaction of information deemed to be
confidential for the purposes of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.).</p>

responsibilities shall include, but need not be limited to:</p>
