STATEMENT This bill requires that the authority of the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to enter into reciprocal personal income tax agreements with other states is to be limited by restricting the termination of any such agreement to the enactment by the Legislature and the Governor of a law directing the termination of an agreement.
