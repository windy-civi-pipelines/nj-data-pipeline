The joint resolution would request the Governor to annually issue a proclamation calling upon public officials and citizens of the State to observe New Jersey Hunting and Fishing Day with appropriate activities and programs.  It would also direct the Division of Fish and Wildlife in the Department of Environmental Protection to take appropriate measures each year to publicize New Jersey Hunting and Fishing Day, and to coordinate at least one of the States free fishing days, selected pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1985, c.352 (C.23:3-1b), with that day.
