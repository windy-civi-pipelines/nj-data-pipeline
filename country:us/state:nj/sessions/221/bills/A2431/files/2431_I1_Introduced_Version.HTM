[f] g.    "Voting device"  means an apparatus which the voter uses to record his  votes on a tabulating card. [g] h.   "County boards of elections"  shall mean the county board of elections  appointed in the various counties or the person or board in charge of elections  in the various counties as provided in Title 19 of the New Jersey Revised  Statutes. (cf: P.L.1973, c.82, s.1) 2.    (New section)    No electronic voting system shall be used in an election in this State unless the electronic voting system vendor discloses any owners or shareholders with a five percent or greater interest or share in the company, in any subsidiary companies, or in the vendors parent company, as well as any changes thereto of five percent or greater,  and has been approved by the Secretary of State. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires electronic voting system vendors to disclose any financial ties prior to approval by the Secretary of State. As amended, the bill would require those vendors to report significant changes in ownership or shareholder status on an ongoing basis. Currently, voting system vendors must meet a number of requirements prior to approval and certification of voting systems in the State.  However, the vendors are not required to disclose financial and investment ties.  This bill would require voting system vendors to disclose any owners or shareholders with a five percent or greater interest or share in the company, in any subsidiary companies, or in the vendors parent company.  The bill would also require changes of five percent or greater in ownership or shareholder status to be reported. This bill is a response to the recent elections security issues.  Several states have taken steps to address potential security risks.  In Maryland, the state moved to require voting system vendors to disclose its investment ties following the revelation that a former First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, owned the firm which financed the buyout of Marylands voting system vendor.  In June of 2019, North Carolinas State Board of Elections voted unanimously for each vendor seeking certification in the state to disclose any owners or shareholders with a five percent or greater interest or share in the company, in any subsidiary companies or in the vendors parent company. This bill draws on the actions of these states to ensure the security of the elections of the State of New Jersey.
