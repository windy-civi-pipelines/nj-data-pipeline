STATEMENT This bill allows certain licensees of the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling to teach in a private school of cosmetology and hairstyling.  Current law limits a license to teach cosmetology and hairstyling to individuals who hold a cosmetologist-hairstylist license.  This bill expands that law to allow individuals holding a license to practice barbering, beauty culture, manicuring or as a hair braiding or skin care specialist to teach in a private school of cosmetology and hairstyling, provided the individuals meet certain other requirements. The bill also makes it an unlawful practice for a teacher to teach a course in a service not within the scope of practice of the professional license held by the teacher.
