The bill is inspired by Emma, a non-verbal, special needs student who experienced a stressful and upsetting event when her bus driver became lost for several hours while transporting her, and fellow students, to school.  The experience was traumatic for Emma, who was unaware of where the school bus was going and was unable to communicate with the school bus driver.  The bill seeks to prevent similar traumatic events from occurring in the future.
