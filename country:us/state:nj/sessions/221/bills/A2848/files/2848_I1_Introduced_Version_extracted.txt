The bill defines employee with a developmental disability as an employee of the taxpayer who has a developmental disability as defined in N.J.S.A.30:6D-25 and for who the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Human Services has declared eligible for its services. New Jersey already allows taxpayers to claim a credit for the employment of certain persons with disabilities at an occupational training center or sheltered workshop.  This bill allows a credit for any type of employment, but taxpayers will be prohibited from claiming the credit allowed by this bill if in the same year they claim a credit for employment of the same employee at an occupational training center or sheltered workshop.
