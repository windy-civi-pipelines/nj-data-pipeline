(cf: P.L.2019, c.402, s.1) 2.  This act shall take effect on July 1 next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill revises the apportionment of State lottery contributions. Under current law, the State lottery contributions made pursuant to the Lottery Enterprise Contribution Act require a minimum of 30 percent of the proceeds accruing from the sale of lottery tickets or shares to be dedicated to the Common Pension Fund L investment account established by the Lottery Enterprise Contribution Act. This bill revises the apportionment of State lottery contributions to require a minimum of 25 percent of the proceeds accruing from the sale of lottery tickets or shares to be dedicated to the Common Pension Fund L investment account in the event that both the average annual total sales of lottery tickets or shares and the total revenues accruing from the sale of lottery tickets or shares in a fiscal year are equal to or greater than both the average annual total sales of lottery tickets or shares and the total revenues accruing from the sale of lottery tickets or shares in the base fiscal year, commencing with the first fiscal year following the base fiscal year. Commencing with the fourth fiscal year following the base fiscal year, if the average annual total sales of lottery tickets or shares and the total revenues accruing from the sale of lottery tickets or shares  of the three consecutive fiscal years are equal to or greater than those figures from the base fiscal year, then the apportionment of State lottery contributions to Common Pension Fund L will remain at a minimum of 25 percent of the proceeds accruing from the sale of lottery tickets or shares.  If the average annual total sales of lottery tickets or shares and the total revenues accruing from the sale of lottery tickets or shares of the three consecutive fiscal years are less than those figures from the base fiscal year, then the apportionment of State lottery contributions to Common Pension Fund L will revert to a minimum of 30 percent of the proceeds accruing from the sale of lottery tickets or shares.  The reversion would go into effect the next fiscal year following the fiscal year containing the shortfall. The bill defines base fiscal year as the fiscal year in which the bill goes into effect.
