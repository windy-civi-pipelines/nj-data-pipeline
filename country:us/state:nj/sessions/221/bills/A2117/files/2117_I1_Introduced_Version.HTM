class=HangingAnActChar> concerning</span> the expansion of paratransit services
in New Jersey and supplementing Title 27 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  The Commissioner of
Transportation, in consultation with the Commissioner of Human Services, shall
establish a three-year pilot program to enhance the availability and
accessibility of paratransit and expand the number of community-based
paratransit options for senior citizens and persons with disabilities in the
State, particularly in those areas of the State that are not served by the
States Access Link program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commissioner shall
designate at least three regions of the State, one in the southern, one in the
northern, and one in the central parts of the State, in which the pilot program
shall operate.  When designating paratransit service regions pursuant to this
subsection, the commissioner shall consider:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the demand for
paratransit services in the region and the number of people who would benefit
from enhanced paratransit services in the region; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   whether, and the extent
to which, the region is served by Access Link.  To the extent practicable,
pilot program service regions shall be designated in areas of the State that
are not well served by Access Link; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   any other factor deemed
by the Commissioners of Transportation or Human Services to be relevant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Commissioner of
Transportation shall solicit applications from, and shall approve a sufficient
number of, community-based organizations to provide paratransit services under
the pilot program.  In order to provide paratransit services under the pilot
program, an applicant shall:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   be established as a
community-based for-profit or not-for-profit organization.  Community-based
organizations that are dedicated to providing services to senior citizens or to
persons with disabilities shall receive priority consideration for pilot
program participation over other types of community-based organizations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   certify to the
commissioner that the organization is capable of complying with the
transportation responsibilities established under the pilot program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   demonstrate that the
organization has a workers compensation policy, a general liability insurance
policy, and an automobile liability insurance policy that covers all vehicles
that will be used in the provision of paratransit services under the pilot
program.  If a provider fails to demonstrate that it has all three insurance
policies and that each policy is current, the provider shall be prohibited from
providing paratransit services under the pilot program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   certify that, when
operating under the pilot program, the provider will use vehicles that seat no
less than four passengers, in addition to the driver; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   certify that all drivers
and other staff members employed by the provider are appropriately licensed or
certified to provide transportation services, as required by law; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   comply with all
applicable criminal history record background check requirements imposed by the
commissioner, and not employ any driver or other person who has ever been
convicted of a disqualifying offense, as defined by the commissioner,
regardless of the date of the offense or conviction therefor;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   register each vehicle to
be used in the pilot program as a commercial or livery vehicle, as
appropriate, and maintain a current vehicle inspection report for each such
vehicle.  Any vehicle that is not appropriately registered, that does not have
a current vehicle inspection report, or that has failed its most recent vehicle
inspection shall not be used to provide paratransit services under the pilot
program; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   commit to providing
paratransit services within fifteen minutes of the scheduled pick-up time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Each community-based
organization that is approved to provide paratransit services under the pilot
program shall ensure that training is completed by the organizations drivers
and by other staff members who will come into direct contact with a person
receiving paratransit services, either within three months after the
organization is approved to participate in the pilot program or within 30 days
after the employee is hired, whichever is later.  Training shall include
instruction on how to provide appropriate and courteous treatment, how to
engage in positive interactions with, and how to satisfy the special needs of,
persons who are receiving paratransit services under the pilot program.  The
Commissioner of Human Services shall develop and distribute training materials
to all approved community-based paratransit service providers for the purposes
of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Each community-based
organization approved to participate in the pilot program shall maintain the
following records and make them available to the Commissioners of Transportation
and Human Services at the conclusion of each year of the pilot programs
operation or at more frequent intervals as determined by the commissioner to be
appropriate:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a daily and monthly
paratransit log showing the types of vehicles dispatched, the number of unique

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require the
Commissioner of Transportation, in consultation with the Commissioner of Human
Services, to establish a three-year pilot program to enhance the availability
and accessibility of paratransit and expand the number of community-based
paratransit options for senior citizens and persons with disabilities in the
State, particularly in those areas of the State that are not served by the
Access Link  the paratransit service that has been implemented by the New
Jersey Transit Corporation for the purposes of complying with the Americans
with Disabilities Act of 1990, Pub.L.101-336 (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioners, in
consultation with each other, will be required to designate at least three
regions of the State, one in the southern, one in the northern, and one in the
central parts of the State, in which the pilot program will operate.  When
designating paratransit service regions, the commissioners are to consider:  1)
the demand for paratransit services in the region and the number of people who
would benefit from enhanced paratransit services in the region; 2) whether, and
the extent to which, the region is served by Access Link; and 3) any other
factor deemed to be relevant.  To the extent practicable, pilot program service
regions are to be designated in areas of the State that are not well served by
Access Link.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill will require the
Commissioner of Transportation to solicit applications from, and approve a
sufficient number of, organizations to provide paratransit services under the
pilot program.  In order to be approved to provide paratransit services under
the pilot program, a service provider will need to:  1) be a community-based
for-profit or not-for-profit organization (with priority consideration being
given to those community-based organizations that are dedicated to serving
senior citizens or persons with disabilities); 2) certify that the provider is
capable of complying with the transportation responsibilities established under
the pilot program; 3) demonstrate that the provider has a workers compensation
policy, a general liability insurance policy, and an automobile liability insurance
policy that covers all vehicles that will be used in the provision of
paratransit services under the pilot program; 4) certify that, when operating
under the pilot program, the provider will use vehicles that seat no less than
four passengers, in addition to the driver; 5) certify that all drivers and
other staff members employed by the provider are appropriately licensed or
certified to provide transportation services, as required by law; 5) comply
with all applicable criminal history record background check requirements
imposed by the Commissioner of Transportation, in consultation with the
Commissioner of Human Services, and not employ any driver or other person who
has ever been convicted of a disqualifying offense, regardless of the date of
the offense or conviction therefor; 6) register each vehicle to be used in the
pilot program as a commercial or livery vehicle, as appropriate, and
maintain a current vehicle inspection report for each such vehicle; and 7)
commit to providing paratransit services within fifteen minutes of the
scheduled pick-up time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each community-based
organization approved to participate in the pilot program will also be required
to ensure that training is completed by the organizations drivers and by other
staff members who will come into direct contact with a person receiving
paratransit services, either within three months after the organization is
approved to participate in the pilot program or within 30 days after the
employee is hired, whichever is later.  Training is to include instruction on
how to provide appropriate and courteous treatment, how to engage in positive
interactions with, and how to satisfy the special needs of, persons who are
receiving paratransit services under the pilot program.  The Commissioner of
Human Services will be required to develop and distribute training materials to
all approved providers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each community-based
organization approved to participate in the pilot program will be required to
maintain the following records and make them available to the commissioners at
the conclusion of each year of the pilot programs operation or at more
frequent intervals as determined by the commissioners to be appropriate:  1) a
daily and monthly paratransit log showing the types of vehicles dispatched, the
number of unique passengers served, and the dedicated routes, if any, or
pick-up locations that were established for and used by each vehicle;  2) a log
of cases in which the waiting time for paratransit service was in excess of 15
minutes past the scheduled pick-up time; and 3) a copy of any complaints
received by the provider in relation to the services provided under the pilot
program, including an indication as to whether and how each complaint was
resolved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 90 days after the
conclusion of the three-year pilot program, the commissioners will be required
to jointly prepare and <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
submit a written report to the Governor and the Legislature, evaluating the
success of the program.  The report is to include certain details about the
program, as specified by the bill, as well as an indication as to whether the
pilot program should be continued on a permanent, Statewide basis and
recommendations for any executive or legislative action that will be necessary
to ensure the programs ongoing success, if continued.  </p>
