The Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List, including any revision thereof or supplement thereto, shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the General Assembly on or before July 1 of each year.  The Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List shall be submitted to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1) at least once in each fiscal year.  The Secretary and the Clerk shall cause the date of submission to be entered upon the Senate Journal and the Minutes of the General Assembly, respectively. Any transportation infrastructure project or the project sponsor thereof not identified in the Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List shall not be eligible for a short-term or temporary loan from the Interim Transportation Financing Program Fund.  The trust may revise or supplement the Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List no more than four times during the fiscal year, and shall submit the revised list to the Legislature when the revisions are made. No funds may be disbursed pursuant to this subsection for transportation project, aviation project, or marine project activities prior to certification in writing, from the trust, that the project activities satisfy the provisions of P.L.1985, c.334 (C.58:11B-1 et seq.), P.L.1997, c.224 (C.58:11B-10.1 et al.), or sections 22 and 34 through 38 of P.L.2016, c.56 (C.58:11B-10.3 through C.58:11B-10.5, C.58:11B-20.2, C.58:11B-22.3, and C.58:11B-22.4).  Construction activities for a transportation project shall also require written notification of award concurrence from the Department of Transportation prior to fund disbursement. h.  The Department of Environmental Protection and the trust shall provide that priority for principal forgiveness shall be given to municipalities in coastal areas, for loans issued pursuant to this section in support of environmental infrastructure projects.  As used in this subsection, "coastal area" means the same as the term is defined in section 4 of P.L.1973, c.185 (C.13:19-4). (cf: P.L.2023, c.63, s.14) 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would requires the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (I-Bank) to provide priority for principal forgiveness on environmental infrastructure project loans to municipalities in coastal areas.  The DEP and the I-Bank finance the State's Water Bank program, which provides financing, in the form of low-interest loans, often with a certain amount of principal forgiveness, in support of wastewater and drinking water projects throughout the State.

Any short-term or temporary loans made by the trust pursuant to this subsection may only be made in advance of the anticipated loans the trust may make and contract to make under the provisions of subsection a. of this section from any source of funds anticipated to be received by the trust.  Any such short-term or temporary loan made pursuant to the Interim Transportation Financing Program shall mature no later than the last day of the third succeeding fiscal year following the closing date on which the short-term or temporary loan was made by the trust to the project sponsor; except a planning, design, and construction loan shall mature no later than the last day of the fifth succeeding fiscal year following the closing date of the planning, design, and construction loan or the last day of the third succeeding fiscal year following the date of construction certification following the closing date of the planning, design, and construction loan, and except a short-term or temporary loan made pursuant to this subsection which has been submitted as part of an application for funding pursuant to the "Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998" (TIFIA), 23 U.S.C. s.601 et seq., as amended and supplemented, shall mature not later than the funding draw period allowed by this federal act.  Any short-term or temporary loan or planning, design and construction loan made by the trust pursuant to this subsection may mature in a shorter period of time as may be necessary to align with construction completion, whichever is sooner, provided that, in either case, project planning or engineering design activities shall not exceed two years from the closing date of the planning, design, and construction loan.  With respect to any short-term or temporary loan or planning, design, and construction loan made by the trust pursuant to this subsection, the trust may authorize one short-term supplemental loan for residual expenses thereof upon receipt by the trust from the Department of Transportation of a certification that states that the time required by the project sponsor to complete construction of the project exceeds the maximum maturity date of the short-term or temporary loan or planning, design, and construction loan.  Any such short-term supplemental loan shall not exceed in duration the last day of the third succeeding fiscal year following the loan closing of the short-term supplemental loan.  The trust may make short-term or temporary loans pursuant to the Interim Transportation Financing Program to any one or more of the project sponsors, for the respective projects thereof, only if a project is identified in the Department of Transportation Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List to be known as the "Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List" in the form provided to the Legislature by the Commissioner of Transportation. The Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List, including any revision thereof or supplement thereto, shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the General Assembly on or before July 1 of each year.  The Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List shall be submitted to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1) at least once in each fiscal year.  The Secretary and the Clerk shall cause the date of submission to be entered upon the Senate Journal and the Minutes of the General Assembly, respectively.

(cf: P.L.2023, c.63, s.14) 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would requires the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (I-Bank) to provide priority for principal forgiveness on environmental infrastructure project loans to municipalities in coastal areas.  The DEP and the I-Bank finance the State's Water Bank program, which provides financing, in the form of low-interest loans, often with a certain amount of principal forgiveness, in support of wastewater and drinking water projects throughout the State.
