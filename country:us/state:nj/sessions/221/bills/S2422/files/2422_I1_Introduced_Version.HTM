<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning the Department of Labor and Workforce
Development establishing an occupational heat stress standard and heat-related
illness and injury prevention program and supplementing Title 34 of the Revised
Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Heat is the leading
weather-related killer, and it is becoming more dangerous as 18 of the last 19
years were the hottest years on record.  Excessive heat can cause heat stroke
and even death if not treated properly.  It also exacerbates existing health
problems like asthma, kidney failure, and heart disease.  Workers in
agriculture and construction are at highest risk, but the problem affects all
workers exposed to heat, including indoor workers without climate-controlled
environments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Heat stress killed 815
United States workers and seriously injured more than 70,000 workers from 1992
through 2017, according to the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor
Statistics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     To date, three states,
California, Oregon, and Washington, have state occupational safety and health
standards that cover outdoor heat exposure.  Minnesota has a state standard
that covers indoor heat exposure.  The United States military has also issued
heat protections. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States Department of Labor has
not adopted a heat stress standard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In the absence of a
heat stress adopted by OSHA, New Jersey may through legislation and regulation
adopt a heat stress standard for the protection of employees against
heat-related illness and injury that applies to employers and employees in this
State both in private and public employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commissioner means the
Commissioner of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development or the
commissioners designee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Department means the
Department of Labor and Workforce Development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Employ means to suffer or to
permit to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Employee means any individual
employed by an employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Employer means any
individual, partnership, association, corporation, and the State and any
county, municipality, or school district in the State, or any agency,
authority, department, bureau, or instrumentality thereof acting directly or
indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Excessive heat means levels
of outdoor or indoor exposure to heat that exceed the capacities of the human
body to maintain normal body functions and may cause heat-related injury or
illness, including those that lead to death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Heat-related illness means a
medical condition resulting from the inability of the body to rid itself of
excess heat, including heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat syncope,
and heat stroke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Heat stress means the net
load to which a worker is exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic
heat, environmental factors, and clothing worn which result in an increase in
heat storage in the body, causing body temperature to rise to sometimes
dangerous levels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Occupation means any
occupation, service, trade, business, industry or branch or group of industries
or employment or class of employment in which employees are employed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Occupational safety and
health standard means a regulation or rule that requires the following: a
condition that is reasonably appropriate or necessary to make employment and
places of employment safe and healthful; or the adoption or use of a means,
method, operation, practice, or process that is reasonably appropriate or
necessary to make employment and places of employment safe and healthful. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Place of employment means a
place in or about which an employee is allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  On or before June 1,
2024, the commissioner shall establish by rule a heat stress standard that
contains the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A standard that
establishes heat stress levels for employers that, if exceeded, trigger actions
by employers to protect employees from heat-related illness and injury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A requirement that each
employer develop, implement, and maintain an effective heat-related illness and
injury prevention plan for employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The heat-related illness
and injury prevention plan referred to in subsection a. of this section shall,
to the extent permitted by federal law, be developed and implemented with the
meaningful participation of employees and employee representatives, including
collective bargaining representatives; shall be tailored and specific to the
hazards in the place of employment; shall be in writing in both English and in
the language understood by a majority of the employers employees, if that
language is not English; and shall be made available at a time and in a manner
set forth by the commissioner in rule, to employees, employee representatives,
including collective bargaining representatives, and to the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The heat-related
illness and injury prevention plan referred to in subsection a. of this section
shall at a minimum contain procedures and methods for the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   initial and regular
monitoring for employee exposure to heat to determine whether an employees
exposure has been excessive;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   providing potable water
with a temperature of less than 15 degrees Celsius or 59 degrees Fahrenheit;</p>

violation of this act, the commissioner may issue a stop-work order against the
employer requiring cessation of all business operations of the employer at one
or more worksites or across all of the employers worksites and places of
business.  The stop-work order may be issued only against the employer found to
be in violation or non-compliance.  The commissioner shall serve a notification
of intent to issue a stop-work order on the employer at the place of business

arguments in support of their respective positions regarding the findings of
the audit or investigation.  The commissioner shall issue a written decision
within five business days of the hearing either upholding or reversing the
employers stop-work order.  The decision shall include the grounds for
upholding or reversing the employers stop-work order.  If the employer
disagrees with the written decision, the employer may appeal the decision to
the commissioner, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act,

paid wages, the commissioner can take assignment of the claim and bring any
legal action necessary to collect all that is due.</p>

under section 3 of this act, implemented a heat-related illness and injury
prevention plan in accordance with the requirements of the departments heat stress
standard, each employer shall on or before May 1 of each subsequent year, or
the next business day, if May 1 falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, review
