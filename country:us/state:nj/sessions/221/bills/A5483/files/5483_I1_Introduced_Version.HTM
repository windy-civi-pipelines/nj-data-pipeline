amending P.L.1985, c.222.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section)  A
municipality may enter into a shared service agreement with any other
municipality or municipalities in the State to transfer a portion of the fair
share affordable housing obligation of one or more sending municipalities to
one or more receiving municipalities.  A shared service agreement between one
or more sending municipalities and one or more receiving municipalities shall
be permissible regardless of whether the sending and receiving municipalities
are in the same housing region, as established pursuant to paragraph (1) of
subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.2024, c.2 (C.52:27D-304.2).  A shared service
agreement entered pursuant to this section shall comply with the requirements
established pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-312).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  Section 2 of P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-302) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  The Legislature finds
that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The New Jersey Supreme
Court, through its rulings in Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel,
67 N.J. 151 (1975) and Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 92
N.J. 158 (1983), has determined that every municipality in a growth area has a
constitutional obligation to provide through its land use regulations a
realistic opportunity for a fair share of its region's present and prospective
needs for housing for low- and moderate-income families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In the second Mount
Laurel ruling, the Supreme Court stated that the determination of the methods
for satisfying this constitutional obligation &quot;is better left to the
Legislature,&quot; that the court has &quot;always preferred legislative to
judicial action in their field,&quot; and that the judicial role in upholding
the Mount Laurel doctrine &quot;could decrease as a result of legislative and
executive action.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The interest of all
citizens, including low- and moderate-income families in need of affordable
housing, and the needs of the workforce, would be best served by a
comprehensive planning and implementation response to this constitutional
obligation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    There are a number of
essential ingredients to a comprehensive planning and implementation response,
including the establishment of reasonable fair share housing guidelines and
standards, the initial determination of fair share by officials at the
municipal level and the preparation of a municipal housing element, State
review of the local fair share study and housing element, and continuous State
funding for low- and moderate-income housing to replace the federal housing
subsidy programs which have been almost completely eliminated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The State can maximize
the number of low- and moderate-income units provided in New Jersey by allowing
its municipalities to adopt appropriate phasing schedules for meeting their
fair share, so long as the municipalities permit a timely achievement of an appropriate
fair share of the regional need for low- and moderate-income housing as
required by the Mount Laurel I and II opinions and other relevant court
decisions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The State can also
maximize the number of low- and moderate-income units by creating new
affordable housing and by rehabilitating existing, but substandard, housing in
the State.  Because the Legislature has determined, pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46
(C.52:27D-329.1 et al.), that it is no longer appropriate or in harmony with
the Mount Laurel doctrine to permit the transfer of the fair share obligations
among municipalities within a housing region, it is necessary and appropriate
to create a new program to create new affordable housing and to foster the
rehabilitation of existing, but substandard, housing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Since the urban areas
are vitally important to the State, construction, conversion, and
rehabilitation of housing in our urban centers should be encouraged.  However,
the provision of housing in urban areas must be balanced with the need to provide
housing throughout the State for the free mobility of citizens.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The Supreme Court of New
Jersey in its Mount Laurel decisions demands that municipal land use
regulations affirmatively afford a  realistic opportunity for a variety and
choice of housing including low- and moderate-cost housing, to meet the needs
of people desiring to live there.  While provision for the actual construction
of that housing by municipalities is not required, they are encouraged but not
mandated to expend their own resources to help provide low- and moderate-income
housing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.2024, c.2)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>The
Legislature finds that the use of regional contribution agreements, which
permits municipalities to transfer a certain portion of their fair share
housing obligation outside of the municipal borders, should no longer be
utilized as a mechanism for the creation of affordable housing by the council.<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>(Deleted
by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)</u> 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    The Legislature finds
that the role of the Council on Affordable Housing, as intended in the original
enactment of the &quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; has not developed in practice as
was intended in the legislation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     The council's inability
to function ultimately led the Supreme Court in 2015 to order the temporary
dissolution of the requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted prior
to resolving affordable housing disputes before the court and allowed the
courts to resume their role as the forum of first resort for evaluating
municipal compliance with Mount Laurel obligations pursuant to guidelines laid
out by the Supreme Court's order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.   The Legislature finds
that the council's inability to function led to a &quot;gap period&quot; that
frustrated the intent of the Legislature and compliance with constitutional and
statutory obligations and that it is necessary to establish definitive
deadlines for municipal action and any challenges to those actions to avoid
such a &quot;gap period&quot; from being repeated in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.    The Legislature finds
that although the court-led system that has developed since 2015 has resulted
in a significant number of settlement agreements and increased production of
affordable housing, the system could operate more expeditiously to produce affordable
housing, and at a lower cost to all parties, if appropriate standards are
established by the Legislature to be applied throughout the State, including
more clarity on calculation on fair share affordable housing obligations using
transparent and established data sources to eliminate the lengthy and costly
processes of determining those obligations that have characterized both the
Council on Affordable Housing and court-led system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     o.    The Legislature
determines that, considering the unique history of the &quot;Fair Housing
Act,&quot; the Council on Affordable Housing shall be abolished and that,
pursuant to the formulas and process established pursuant to sections 6 and 7
of P.L.2024, c.2 (C.52:27D-304.2 and C.52:27D-304.3), a municipality shall be authorized
to seek approval of its fair share affordable housing obligation, adopted
pursuant to binding resolution and then filed with the court, with the guidance
of calculations published by the Department of Community Affairs, but that
advocates for the low- and moderate-income households of the State shall be
provided with an opportunity to contest the municipal determination.</p>

as amended and supplemented by P.L.2024, c.2 (C.52:27D-304.1 et al.), is
intended to implement the Mount Laurel doctrine, and that municipalities in
compliance with the &quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301
et al.) are also in compliance with the Mount Laurel doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     q.    The Legislature finds
that the population of persons aged 65 years and older in the State has grown
from approximately 13 percent in 1990, to 17 percent in 2021, and that such
growth, in conjunction with expected future growth, makes it appropriate for
the Legislature to allow up to 30 percent of the units towards a municipality's
prospective affordable housing obligation to be satisfied through the creation
of age-restricted housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     r.  The &quot;Fair Housing

c.222 (C.52:27D-311) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11.  a.  In adopting its
housing element, the municipality may provide for its fair share of low- and
moderate-income housing by means of any technique or combination of techniques
which provide a realistic opportunity for the provision of the fair share.  The
housing element shall contain an analysis demonstrating that it will provide
such a realistic opportunity, and the municipality shall establish that its
land use and other relevant ordinances have been revised to incorporate the
provisions for low- and moderate-income housing.  In preparing the housing
element, the municipality shall consider the following techniques for providing
low- and moderate-income housing within the municipality, as well as such other
appropriate techniques as have been established through applicable precedent
and may be employed by the municipality:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Rezoning for densities
necessary to assure the economic viability of any inclusionary developments,
either through mandatory set-asides or density bonuses, as may be necessary to
meet all or part of the municipality's fair share in accordance with the provisions
of subsection h. of this section;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Determination of the
total residential zoning necessary to assure that the municipality's fair share
is achieved;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Determination of
measures that the municipality will take to assure that  low- and moderate-income
units remain affordable to  low- and moderate-income households for an
appropriate period of not less than the period required by the regulations
adopted by the Department of Community Affairs pursuant to section 21 of
P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A plan for
infrastructure expansion and rehabilitation and conversion or redevelopment of
unused or underutilized real property, including existing structures, if
necessary to assure the achievement of the municipality's fair share of low-
and moderate-income housing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Donation or use of
municipally owned land or land condemned by the municipality for purposes of
providing low- and moderate-income housing;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Tax abatements for
purposes of providing low- and moderate-income housing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Utilization of funds
obtained from any State or federal subsidy toward the construction of low- and
moderate-income housing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   Utilization of
municipally generated funds toward the construction of low- and moderate-income
housing; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   The purchase of
privately owned real property used for residential purposes at the value of all
liens secured by the property, excluding any tax liens, notwithstanding that
the total amount of debt secured by liens exceeds the appraised value of the
property, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Community
Affairs pursuant to subsection b. of section 41 of P.L.2000, c.126
(C.52:27D-311.2).</p>

P.L.2008, c.46)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Nothing in P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) shall require a municipality to raise or expend
municipal revenues in order to provide low- and moderate-income housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     When a municipality's
housing element includes the provision of rental housing units in a community
residence for the developmentally disabled, for the mentally ill, or for
persons with head injuries, as those terms are defined in section 2 of
P.L.1977, c.448 (C.30:11B-2), or in transitional housing, which will be
affordable to persons of low- and moderate-income, and for which adequate
measures to retain such affordability pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection
a. of this section are included in the housing element, those housing units
shall be fully credited towards the fulfillment of the municipality's fair
share of low- and moderate-income housing.  A municipality shall not credit
transitional housing units towards more than 10 percent of the municipality's
fair share obligation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     It having been
determined by the Legislature that the provision of housing under P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) is a public purpose, a municipality or
municipalities may utilize public monies to make donations, grants or loans of
public funds for the rehabilitation of deficient housing units and the
provision of new or substantially rehabilitated housing for low- and
moderate-income persons, providing that any private advantage is incidental.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    A municipality that has
received approval of its housing element and fair share plan for the current
round, and that has actually effected the construction of the affordable
housing units it is obligated to provide, may amend its affordable housing
element or zoning ordinances without losing immunity from exclusionary zoning
litigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Whenever affordable
housing units are proposed to be provided through an inclusionary development,
a municipality shall provide, through its zoning powers, incentives to the
developer, which shall include increased densities and reduced costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     A municipality and a
developer may request a modification of a compliance certification involving
reduced affordable housing set-asides or increased densities to ensure the
economic feasibility of an inclusionary development, if any such application
demonstrates how any shortfall in meeting the municipal fair share obligation
will then be addressed.  Such a request may be granted only if the municipality
and developer have demonstrated that the project has been impacted by market
conditions beyond their reasonable control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     A municipality may
enter into an agreement with a developer or residential development owner to
provide a preference for affordable housing to low- and moderate-income
veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as defined in section 1
of P.L.1963, c.171 (C.54:4-8.10), of up to 50 percent of the affordable units
in that particular project.  This preference shall be established in the
applicant selection process for available affordable units so that applicants
who are veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as referenced in
this subsection, and who apply within 90 days of the initial marketing period
shall receive preference for the rental of the agreed-upon percentage of
affordable units.  After the first 90 days of the initial 120-day marketing
period, if any of those units subject to the preference remain available, then
applicants from the general public shall be considered for occupancy. 
Following the initial 120-day marketing period, previously qualified applicants
and future qualified applicants who are veterans who served in time of war or
other emergency, as referenced in this subsection, shall be placed on a special
waiting list as well as the general waiting list.  The veterans on the special
waiting list shall be given preference for affordable units, as the units
become available, whenever the percentage of preference-occupied units falls
below the agreed upon percentage.  Any agreement to provide affordable housing
preferences for veterans pursuant to this subsection shall not affect a
municipality's ability to receive credit for the unit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.  In the fourth round, and
in subsequent rounds of affordable housing obligations, a municipality shall be
able to receive one credit against its affordable housing obligation for each
unit of low- or moderate-income housing and shall not receive bonus credit for
any particular type of low- or moderate-income housing, unless authority to
obtain bonus credit is expressly provided pursuant to this section or other
sections of the &quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et
al.).  A municipality shall not receive more than one type of bonus credit for
any unit and a municipality shall not be permitted to satisfy more than 25
percent of its prospective need obligation in the fourth round or any
subsequent round through the use of bonus credits.  This subsection shall not
be construed to limit the ability of a municipality to receive a unit of credit
for a low- or moderate-income housing unit that is subject to affordability
controls that are scheduled to expire, but are extended pursuant to section 21
of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321), to the extent that this affordability
control extension would otherwise generate this credit.  As a part of a fair
share plan and housing element adopted pursuant to subsection f. of section 3
of P.L.2024, c.2 (C.52:27D-304.1), a municipality shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  receive one unit of
credit and one bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing
for individuals with special needs or permanent supportive housing, as those
terms are defined in section 2 of P.L.2004, c.70 (C.34:1B-21.24);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  receive one unit of
credit and one-half bonus credit for each low- or moderate-income ownership
unit created in partnership sponsorship with a non-profit housing developer;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  receive one unit of
credit and one-half bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income
housing located within a one-half mile radius, or one-mile radius for projects
located in a Garden State Growth Zone, as defined in section 2 of P.L.2011,
c.149 (C.34:1B-243), surrounding a New Jersey Transit Corporation, Port
Authority Transit Corporation, or Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation rail,
bus, or ferry station, including all light rail stations.  For the purpose of
this subparagraph, the distance from the bus, rail, or ferry station to a
housing unit shall be measured from the closest point on the outer perimeter of
the station, including any associated park-and-ride lot, to the closest point
of the housing project property; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  receive one unit of
credit and one-half bonus credit for a unit of age-restricted housing, provided
that a bonus credit for age-restricted housing shall not be applied to more
than 10 percent of the units of age-restricted housing constructed in
compliance with the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the
New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency in a municipality that count
towards the municipality's affordable housing obligation for any single 10-year
round of affordable housing obligations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  receive one unit of
credit and one-half bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income
family housing with at least three bedrooms above the minimum number required
by the bedroom distribution.  This bonus credit shall be calculated by taking
into account the full municipal fair share plan and housing element, and the
number of units with at least three bedrooms required for projects satisfying
the minimum 50 percent family housing requirements.  A municipality shall
receive the bonus credit pursuant to this paragraph for each unit with at least
three bedrooms that are above the minimum number required for the bedroom
distribution determined pursuant to the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls
promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  receive one unit of
credit and one-half bonus credit for a unit of low- or moderate-income housing
constructed on land that is or was previously developed and utilized for
retail, office, or commercial space; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)  receive one unit of
credit and one-half bonus credit for each existing low- or moderate-income
rental housing unit for which affordability controls are extended for a new
term of affordability, in compliance with the Uniform Housing Affordability
Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, and
the municipality contributes funding towards the costs necessary for this
preservation;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)  receive one unit of
credit and one bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing in
a 100 percent affordable housing project for which the municipality contributes
toward the costs of the project.  This contribution may consist of: (a) real
property donations that enable siting and construction of the project or (b)
contributions from the municipal affordable housing trust fund in support of
the project, if the contribution consists of no less than three percent of the
project cost;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)  receive one unit of
credit and one-half bonus credit for each unit of very low-income housing for
families above the 13 percent of units required to be reserved for very
low-income housing pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1). 
In accordance with section 7 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1), a municipality
shall not be required to provide that a specific percentage of the units in any
specific project be reserved as very low-income housing in order to obtain this
bonus credit, and the 13 percent level, for the purpose of bonus credits, shall
be calculated against the full prospective need obligation provided pursuant to
the fair share plan; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  receive one unit of
credit and one bonus credit for each unit of low- or moderate-income housing
created by transforming an existing rental or ownership unit from a market rate
unit to an affordable housing unit.  A municipality may only rely on this bonus
credit as part of its fair share plan and housing element if the municipality
demonstrates that a commitment to follow through with this market to affordable
agreement has been made and: (a) this agreement has been signed by the property
owner; or (b) the municipality has obtained ownership of the property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.  A municipality may not
satisfy more than 30 percent of the affordable housing units, exclusive of any
bonus credits, to address its prospective need affordable housing obligation
through the creation of age-restricted housing.  A municipality shall satisfy a
minimum of 50 percent of the actual affordable housing units, exclusive of any
bonus credits, created to address its prospective need affordable housing
obligation through the creation of housing available to families with children
and otherwise in compliance with the requirements and controls established
pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-321).  A municipality shall
satisfy a minimum of 25 percent of the actual affordable housing units,
exclusive of any bonus credits, to address its prospective need affordable
housing obligation, through rental housing, including at least half of that
number available to families with children.  All units referred to in this
section shall otherwise be in compliance  with the requirements and controls

entitled to rely upon regulations on municipal credits, adjustments, and
compliance mechanisms adopted by the Council on Affordable Housing unless those
regulations are contradicted by statute, including but not limited to P.L.2024,

compliance certification.  A municipality may fund infrastructure improvements
for affordable housing projects, through the adoption of a development
