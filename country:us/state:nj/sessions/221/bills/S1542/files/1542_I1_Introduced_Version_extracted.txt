[Prior to the June 2004 primary election, when such a newly registered voter seeks to vote for the first time following his or her registration, the voter will be required to provide such personal identification information.] Beginning with the June 2004 primary election, when such a newly registered voter seeks to vote for the first time following his or her registration, the voter will not be required to provide such information if he or she had previously provided the personal identification information required pursuant to this section. The required information shall be collected and stored for the time and in the manner required pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary of State. j.     The Secretary of State shall amend the voter registration application form if necessary to conform to the requirements of applicable federal or State law. k.    In the event that the name of any political party entered on the voter registration form by a voter who wishes to declare a political party affiliation is not legible, the commissioner of registration shall mail the voter a political party declaration form and a letter explaining that the voter's choice was not understood and that the voter should complete and return the declaration form in order to be affiliated with a party. (cf:  P.L.2019, c.270, s.3) 9.    R.S.19:31-7 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-7.  For the convenience of the voters the respective municipal clerks or their duly authorized clerk or clerks in all municipalities shall also be empowered to register applicants for permanent registration up to and including the [21st] 14th day preceding any election and after any such election in the manner indicated above, subject to such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the commissioner, in counties having a superintendent of elections, and the county board in all other counties. Duly authorized clerk as used in this section shall mean a clerk who resides within the municipality and has been approved by the commissioner or the county board as the case may be.  For this purpose the commissioner shall forward to each municipal clerk a sufficient supply of registration forms.  The commissioners shall keep a record of the serial numbers of these forms and shall periodically make such checks as are necessary to accurately determine if all such forms are satisfactorily accounted for. Each municipal clerk shall transmit daily to the commissioner all of the filled out registration forms that he may have in his office at the time. (cf:  P.L.2005, c.139, s.12) 10.  R.S.19:31-11 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-11. a.  In all counties within the State, change of residence notices shall be made by a written request, signed by the registrant, forwarded to the commissioner by mail, and actually received by the commissioner, or by calling in person at the office of the commissioner or the municipal clerk.  The commissioner shall provide change of residence notices in card form for the use of any registered voter moving to another address within the same election district or to another election district within the same county. Copies of these notices shall also be available at the office of the municipal clerk in each municipality.  Each municipal clerk shall transmit daily to the commissioner all the filled out change of residence notices that may be in the municipal clerk's office at the time.  These notices shall be printed upon cards, shall contain a blank form showing where the applicant last resided and the address and exact location to which the applicant has moved and shall have a line for the applicant's signature, printed name and date of birth. Upon receipt of such change of residence notice the commissioner shall cause the signature to be compared with the registration forms of the applicant and, if such signature appears to be of and by one and the same legal voter, the commissioner shall cause the entry of the change of residence to be made on those registration forms and the registrant shall thereupon be qualified to vote in the election district to which the registrant shall have so moved.  If the commissioner is not satisfied as to the signature on the request for a change of residence, a confirmation notice  as prescribed by subsection d. of R.S.19:31-15 shall be sent by mail with postage prepaid to the registrant at the new address. The application for change of residence shall be filed with the commissioner or municipal clerk, as the case may be, on or before the [21st] 14th day preceding any election. b.    In any county any voter who, prior to an election, shall move within the same county after the time above prescribed for filing an application for change of residence without having made application for change of residence, or who has not returned a confirmation notice sent to the voter by the commissioner of registration of the county, if such a notice has been sent to the voter, or who has not moved since the previous election but whose registration information is missing or otherwise deficient, or has otherwise failed to notify the commissioner of registration of the voter's change of address within the county, shall be permitted to vote in that election in the district to which the voter has moved, upon making a written affirmation regarding the change of address at the polling place of the district in which the voter resides on the day of the election.  No identifying document shall be required from the voter for this affirmation.  A district board member shall provide the voter with a provisional ballot, and an envelope with an affirmation statement that conforms with the requirements for such documents contained in subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-1).  The voter shall complete the provisional ballot and affirmation statement, place the ballot in the envelope, seal and return it to the district board member.  The board member shall review the information in the affirmation statement for completeness before forwarding it for inspection, tabulation and notation by the county board of elections, as provided for by sections 7 through 26 of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-1 through C.19:53C-20).  The affirmation statement shall constitute a transfer to the registrant's new residence for any subsequent election. However, if the voter has moved from one residence to another within the same election district at any time, the voter shall be permitted to vote in such election district at any election in the same manner as other voters at the polling place upon written affirmation by the registrant to the district board member of the registrant's change of address. c.     A voter who moves from an election district in one county to an election district in another county prior to the close of registration preceding an election shall register in the new county of residence, in accordance with the provisions of R.S.19:31-6, in order to be permitted to vote. (cf:  P.L.2005, c.139, s.13) 11.  R.S.19:31-13 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-13.  Whenever the registrant after his or her original registration shall change his or her name due to marriage, divorce, or by judgment of court, the registrant shall in person or by mail submit to the commissioner of registration a written statement notifying the commissioner of the change, which statement shall take such form, and be printed on a postal card suitable for mailing of such design, as the [Attorney General] Secretary of State shall prescribe and shall be signed by the registrant.  The commissioner, upon receipt of such a notice of change of name, shall revise accordingly the name of the registrant as it appears among the items of information concerning the registrant included on the registrant's registration forms, shall make a photographic copy of the notice of name change submitted by the registrant, and shall affix the original notice so submitted to the registrant's original registration form and the photographic copy of that notice to the registrant's duplicate registration record. When notice of such change in name has not been received by or filed with the commissioner prior to the [21st] 14th day preceding any election, such person may be permitted to vote under the name under which the person was registered prior to that change at the first election following such change in name at which the person shall appear to vote, after signing the signature copy register with both the registered name and his or her new name.  The commissioner shall then revise accordingly the name of the registrant as it appears on the registrant's registration forms, make a photographic copy of the notice, and affix the original and copy of the notice to the registrant's permanent registration forms as hereinabove prescribed. (cf:  P.L.2005, c.139, s.14) 12.  R.S.19:31-15 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-15. a.  Upon receipt by the commissioner of registration of a county from a registered voter of that county of a request that the name of the registrant be removed from the Statewide voter registration system, the commissioner shall so remove the registrant's name.  Notice by a registered voter to the commissioner of registration of a county that the registrant has ceased to reside in the State shall, for the purposes of this subsection, be deemed a request for removal of the registrant's name from the Statewide voter registration system. b.    The commissioner of registration of any county may agree with the United States Postal Service or its licensee to receive information provided by the Postal Service concerning the change by any Postal Service customer of that customer's address within the county.  If it appears from information so received that a Postal Service customer registered to vote in the county has moved to a different address, then (1) if that address is within the county, the commissioner shall cause the registration records of the registrant to be corrected accordingly and shall transmit to the resident by forwardable mail a notice of the change and a postage prepaid, pre-addressed return form by which the registrant may verify or correct the address information, or (2) if that address is not within the county, the commissioner shall undertake the confirmation notice procedure prescribed under subsection d. of this section to confirm the change of address. c.     The commissioner of registration of a county shall cause the name of a registrant to be removed from the Statewide voter registration system if the registrant (1) confirms in writing, by return of a confirmation notice as prescribed under subsection d. of this section or by other means, that the registrant has changed residence to a place outside the State, or (2) has either not notified the commissioner or failed to respond to a confirmation notice as so prescribed and has not, in any election during the period beginning on the date on which the commissioner sends the confirmation notice to the registrant and ending on the day after the second general election for federal office following that date on which the notice is sent, (a) voted, or (b) appeared to vote in any county and, if necessary, correct the official record of the registrant's address. Other than as provided under subsection a. of this section, the name of a registrant shall not be removed from the Statewide voter registration system on the ground that the registrant has changed residence except as provided by this subsection. d.    A confirmation notice sent to ascertain whether a registrant continues to reside at the address from which that registrant is registered to vote shall be a postage prepaid and pre-addressed return card, sent by forwardable mail, which shall include:  (1) space on which the registrant's current address may be entered; (2) the statement "To any voter who continues to reside at the residence address to which this notice is addressed or who no longer resides at that residence address but continues to reside in.................. (name of county):  please mail or personally deliver this postage prepaid card to the commissioner of registration to whom it is addressed not later than................. (calendar date of the [21st] 14th day preceding the next election to be held in the county).  If you do not return this card by that date, then at any election held subsequent to that date and on or before................. (calendar date of the day after the second general election for federal office following that date), you may be required at the polls to affirm or confirm your address before you are permitted to vote, and if you do not vote in an election during that period, your name will be removed from the registry of eligible voters."; and (3) a statement, the text of which shall be prescribed by the [Attorney General] Secretary of State, setting forth the means by which a registrant who has changed residence to a county different from that in which is located the residence to which the notice was originally addressed may retain the right to vote. e.     The commissioner of registration shall correct the registry list of eligible voters in accordance with change of residence information obtained in conformity with the provisions of this section. (cf:  P.L.2005, c.145, s.12) 13.  R.S.19:31-18 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-18. On or before the [eighth] fifth day preceding any general election the commissioner shall certify and transmit to the county clerk a complete list of all persons who are registered in each election district in each municipality in the county together with a statement as to the number of persons registered in each district.   The list of registered voters shall include only the following information for each registered voter:  name, address, date of birth, political party affiliation, and voting history.  Except when so ordered by a court, the list of registered voters shall not include voter signatures.  The list shall be drawn from the Statewide voter registration system, established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.145 (C.19:31-31).  It shall in figures state the total number of names of persons registered.  Such lists shall be arranged substantially in the following form: Grand Street Residence number         Name of voter or other designation 14              Jones, Charles  M. 15                Smith, John M. (cf:  P.L.2005, c.145, s.13) 14.  R.S.19:31-20 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-20. On or before the [eighth] fifth day preceding the primary election for the general election and the general election, respectively, the commissioner in counties not having a superintendent of elections, shall deliver to the municipal clerk in each municipality the signature copy registers for each election district in such municipality and shall take a receipt for same. The municipal clerk shall thereupon deliver at his office, or in any other way he sees fit, such registers to a member or members of the proper district boards at the same time and together with the primary for the general election sample ballots or the general election sample ballots, as the case may be.  The registers shall be used by the district boards on election days and for the purpose of mailing the sample ballots.  The commissioner in counties having a superintendent of elections shall deliver such registers at his office, or in any other way he may see fit, to the various district boards, taking a receipt for same. Before delivering the registers the commissioner shall cause to be printed upon a separate sheet or sheets of paper, to be inserted inside of the front cover of such registers in conspicuous type, such instructions to election officers regarding the use and disposition of the binders and forms as he deems necessary. (cf: P.L.2011, c.134, s.41) 15.  This act shall take effect on January 1 next following enactment, except that the Secretary of State and the county commissioners of registration may take such anticipatory action as may be needed to effectuate the purposes of this act. STATEMENT Currently, a person eligible to vote is required to register at least 21 days prior to an election in order to vote in that election.  This bill would provide that a person eligible to vote may register up to 14 days prior to an election and vote in that election. The bill would not affect the constitutional requirement that a person must reside in a county for 30 days prior to an election in order to be eligible to vote in that election.

Duly authorized clerk as used in this section shall mean a clerk who resides within the municipality and has been approved by the commissioner or the county board as the case may be.  For this purpose the commissioner shall forward to each municipal clerk a sufficient supply of registration forms.  The commissioners shall keep a record of the serial numbers of these forms and shall periodically make such checks as are necessary to accurately determine if all such forms are satisfactorily accounted for. Each municipal clerk shall transmit daily to the commissioner all of the filled out registration forms that he may have in his office at the time. (cf:  P.L.2005, c.139, s.12) 10.  R.S.19:31-11 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-11. a.  In all counties within the State, change of residence notices shall be made by a written request, signed by the registrant, forwarded to the commissioner by mail, and actually received by the commissioner, or by calling in person at the office of the commissioner or the municipal clerk.  The commissioner shall provide change of residence notices in card form for the use of any registered voter moving to another address within the same election district or to another election district within the same county.

Upon receipt of such change of residence notice the commissioner shall cause the signature to be compared with the registration forms of the applicant and, if such signature appears to be of and by one and the same legal voter, the commissioner shall cause the entry of the change of residence to be made on those registration forms and the registrant shall thereupon be qualified to vote in the election district to which the registrant shall have so moved.  If the commissioner is not satisfied as to the signature on the request for a change of residence, a confirmation notice  as prescribed by subsection d. of R.S.19:31-15 shall be sent by mail with postage prepaid to the registrant at the new address. The application for change of residence shall be filed with the commissioner or municipal clerk, as the case may be, on or before the [21st] 14th day preceding any election. b.    In any county any voter who, prior to an election, shall move within the same county after the time above prescribed for filing an application for change of residence without having made application for change of residence, or who has not returned a confirmation notice sent to the voter by the commissioner of registration of the county, if such a notice has been sent to the voter, or who has not moved since the previous election but whose registration information is missing or otherwise deficient, or has otherwise failed to notify the commissioner of registration of the voter's change of address within the county, shall be permitted to vote in that election in the district to which the voter has moved, upon making a written affirmation regarding the change of address at the polling place of the district in which the voter resides on the day of the election.  No identifying document shall be required from the voter for this affirmation.  A district board member shall provide the voter with a provisional ballot, and an envelope with an affirmation statement that conforms with the requirements for such documents contained in subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-1).  The voter shall complete the provisional ballot and affirmation statement, place the ballot in the envelope, seal and return it to the district board member.  The board member shall review the information in the affirmation statement for completeness before forwarding it for inspection, tabulation and notation by the county board of elections, as provided for by sections 7 through 26 of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-1 through C.19:53C-20).  The affirmation statement shall constitute a transfer to the registrant's new residence for any subsequent election. However, if the voter has moved from one residence to another within the same election district at any time, the voter shall be permitted to vote in such election district at any election in the same manner as other voters at the polling place upon written affirmation by the registrant to the district board member of the registrant's change of address. c.     A voter who moves from an election district in one county to an election district in another county prior to the close of registration preceding an election shall register in the new county of residence, in accordance with the provisions of R.S.19:31-6, in order to be permitted to vote. (cf:  P.L.2005, c.139, s.13) 11.  R.S.19:31-13 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-13.  Whenever the registrant after his or her original registration shall change his or her name due to marriage, divorce, or by judgment of court, the registrant shall in person or by mail submit to the commissioner of registration a written statement notifying the commissioner of the change, which statement shall take such form, and be printed on a postal card suitable for mailing of such design, as the [Attorney General] Secretary of State shall prescribe and shall be signed by the registrant.  The commissioner, upon receipt of such a notice of change of name, shall revise accordingly the name of the registrant as it appears among the items of information concerning the registrant included on the registrant's registration forms, shall make a photographic copy of the notice of name change submitted by the registrant, and shall affix the original notice so submitted to the registrant's original registration form and the photographic copy of that notice to the registrant's duplicate registration record. When notice of such change in name has not been received by or filed with the commissioner prior to the [21st] 14th day preceding any election, such person may be permitted to vote under the name under which the person was registered prior to that change at the first election following such change in name at which the person shall appear to vote, after signing the signature copy register with both the registered name and his or her new name.  The commissioner shall then revise accordingly the name of the registrant as it appears on the registrant's registration forms, make a photographic copy of the notice, and affix the original and copy of the notice to the registrant's permanent registration forms as hereinabove prescribed. (cf:  P.L.2005, c.139, s.14) 12.  R.S.19:31-15 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-15. a.  Upon receipt by the commissioner of registration of a county from a registered voter of that county of a request that the name of the registrant be removed from the Statewide voter registration system, the commissioner shall so remove the registrant's name.  Notice by a registered voter to the commissioner of registration of a county that the registrant has ceased to reside in the State shall, for the purposes of this subsection, be deemed a request for removal of the registrant's name from the Statewide voter registration system. b.    The commissioner of registration of any county may agree with the United States Postal Service or its licensee to receive information provided by the Postal Service concerning the change by any Postal Service customer of that customer's address within the county.  If it appears from information so received that a Postal Service customer registered to vote in the county has moved to a different address, then (1) if that address is within the county, the commissioner shall cause the registration records of the registrant to be corrected accordingly and shall transmit to the resident by forwardable mail a notice of the change and a postage prepaid, pre-addressed return form by which the registrant may verify or correct the address information, or (2) if that address is not within the county, the commissioner shall undertake the confirmation notice procedure prescribed under subsection d. of this section to confirm the change of address. c.     The commissioner of registration of a county shall cause the name of a registrant to be removed from the Statewide voter registration system if the registrant (1) confirms in writing, by return of a confirmation notice as prescribed under subsection d. of this section or by other means, that the registrant has changed residence to a place outside the State, or (2) has either not notified the commissioner or failed to respond to a confirmation notice as so prescribed and has not, in any election during the period beginning on the date on which the commissioner sends the confirmation notice to the registrant and ending on the day after the second general election for federal office following that date on which the notice is sent, (a) voted, or (b) appeared to vote in any county and, if necessary, correct the official record of the registrant's address. Other than as provided under subsection a. of this section, the name of a registrant shall not be removed from the Statewide voter registration system on the ground that the registrant has changed residence except as provided by this subsection. d.    A confirmation notice sent to ascertain whether a registrant continues to reside at the address from which that registrant is registered to vote shall be a postage prepaid and pre-addressed return card, sent by forwardable mail, which shall include:  (1) space on which the registrant's current address may be entered; (2) the statement "To any voter who continues to reside at the residence address to which this notice is addressed or who no longer resides at that residence address but continues to reside in.................. (name of county):  please mail or personally deliver this postage prepaid card to the commissioner of registration to whom it is addressed not later than................. (calendar date of the [21st] 14th day preceding the next election to be held in the county).  If you do not return this card by that date, then at any election held subsequent to that date and on or before................. (calendar date of the day after the second general election for federal office following that date), you may be required at the polls to affirm or confirm your address before you are permitted to vote, and if you do not vote in an election during that period, your name will be removed from the registry of eligible voters."; and (3) a statement, the text of which shall be prescribed by the [Attorney General] Secretary of State, setting forth the means by which a registrant who has changed residence to a county different from that in which is located the residence to which the notice was originally addressed may retain the right to vote. e.     The commissioner of registration shall correct the registry list of eligible voters in accordance with change of residence information obtained in conformity with the provisions of this section. (cf:  P.L.2005, c.145, s.12) 13.  R.S.19:31-18 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-18. On or before the [eighth] fifth day preceding any general election the commissioner shall certify and transmit to the county clerk a complete list of all persons who are registered in each election district in each municipality in the county together with a statement as to the number of persons registered in each district.   The list of registered voters shall include only the following information for each registered voter:  name, address, date of birth, political party affiliation, and voting history.  Except when so ordered by a court, the list of registered voters shall not include voter signatures.  The list shall be drawn from the Statewide voter registration system, established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.145 (C.19:31-31).  It shall in figures state the total number of names of persons registered.  Such lists shall be arranged substantially in the following form: Grand Street Residence number         Name of voter or other designation 14              Jones, Charles  M. 15                Smith, John M. (cf:  P.L.2005, c.145, s.13) 14.  R.S.19:31-20 is amended to read as follows: 19:31-20. On or before the [eighth] fifth day preceding the primary election for the general election and the general election, respectively, the commissioner in counties not having a superintendent of elections, shall deliver to the municipal clerk in each municipality the signature copy registers for each election district in such municipality and shall take a receipt for same. The municipal clerk shall thereupon deliver at his office, or in any other way he sees fit, such registers to a member or members of the proper district boards at the same time and together with the primary for the general election sample ballots or the general election sample ballots, as the case may be.  The registers shall be used by the district boards on election days and for the purpose of mailing the sample ballots.  The commissioner in counties having a superintendent of elections shall deliver such registers at his office, or in any other way he may see fit, to the various district boards, taking a receipt for same. Before delivering the registers the commissioner shall cause to be printed upon a separate sheet or sheets of paper, to be inserted inside of the front cover of such registers in conspicuous type, such instructions to election officers regarding the use and disposition of the binders and forms as he deems necessary. (cf: P.L.2011, c.134, s.41) 15.  This act shall take effect on January 1 next following enactment, except that the Secretary of State and the county commissioners of registration may take such anticipatory action as may be needed to effectuate the purposes of this act. STATEMENT Currently, a person eligible to vote is required to register at least 21 days prior to an election in order to vote in that election.  This bill would provide that a person eligible to vote may register up to 14 days prior to an election and vote in that election. The bill would not affect the constitutional requirement that a person must reside in a county for 30 days prior to an election in order to be eligible to vote in that election.
