<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes several
procedures by which a plenary retail consumption license, generally issued to
bars and restaurants, may be transferred for use as part of an economic
redevelopment plan or in connection with premises located in a redevelopment,
improvement, or revitalization area located in another municipality.  The bill
defines redevelopment, improvement, or revitalization area as an urban
enterprise zone; a downtown business improvement zone; a pedestrian mall or
pedestrian mall improvement or special improvement district; a transit oriented
development; an area determined to be in need of redevelopment; an area
determined to be in need of rehabilitation; or any improvement which is 100
percent new construction, which is an entirely new improvement not previously
occupied or used for any purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black'>Under
current law, a municipality may issue plenary retail consumption licenses until
the combined total number in the municipality is fewer than one license for each
3,000 municipal residents.  This bill allows a municipality that is entitled to
issue an additional plenary retail consumption license to </span>offer the
license at public sale to the highest bidding governing body of any other
municipality in this State.  A license transferred to a receiving municipality
only is to be used in connection with a premises as part of an economic
redevelopment plan or located within a redevelopment, improvement, or
revitalization area.  The bill requires the host municipality to provide notice
of the public sale to the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage
Control and other municipalities at least 90 days prior to the sale.  The
notice to the municipalities is to specify the minimum acceptable bid and general
conditions of sale including a statement that the transferring municipality
reserves the right to reject all bids where the highest bid is not accepted.  The
funds derived from the sale are to be remitted to the municipal treasurer for
the general use of the host municipality. A receiving municipality that
acquires the license would be entitled to offer the license at public sale.  A
license issued by the receiving municipality to a qualified bidder that is not
actively used in connection with the operation of a premises within two years
of the issuance date is to expire and not be reissued by the receiving
municipality.  The receiving municipality would be prohibited from acquiring more
than one license through this bidding process in each calendar year.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     In
addition, this bill establishes two procedures for transferring an inactive
plenary retail consumption license to a different municipality.  Under current
law, an inactive plenary retail consumption license is a license to sell
alcoholic beverages for on premises consumption that is not being used at an
open and operating licensed premises.  A licensee is required to place the
license on inactive status when the licensed business ceases operation and
the license continues to be held by the licensee of record.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     Under
this bill, a license that remains inactive for two license terms is to expire. 
Prior to the expiration of the license, an inactive license is to </span>be
actively used by the license holder or transferred to another person who
intends to use the license in a private transaction for fair market value. The
bill also allows the holder of the inactive license to <span style='color:black'>apply
to the governing body of a sending municipality that issued the license and a
receiving municipality located within the same county </span>to use the license
in connection with a premises located in the receiving municipality.  An
inactive plenary retail consumption license used in the receiving municipality
only would be used as part of an economic redevelopment plan or in connection
with a premises located within a redevelopment, improvement, or revitalization
area.  The bill requires the transferred license to remain in the receiving
municipality and prohibits the transfer of license to any other municipality.  <span
style='color:black'>Under the bill, the </span>sending and receiving municipalities
are to submit to the director notice of the intent to transfer a license at
least 90 days prior to the transfer. The bill requires the sending and
receiving municipalities to adopt by majority vote identical resolutions
authorizing the transfer of the license.  The identical resolutions are to
establish the license transfer fee agreed upon by both municipal governing
bodies.  A receiving municipality that acquires a license would be entitled to
offer the license at public sale in accordance with current law.  A license
issued by a receiving municipality that is not actively used in connection with
the operation of a premises within two years of the transfer date would expire
and not be reissued by the receiving municipality.  In addition, the bill
provides that these licenses would be subject to certain restrictions.  The
receiving municipality would be required to issue the license to an applicant
who certifies to the sending and receiving municipality that the license will
be used in connection with the operation of a restaurant at which the retail
sale of food is the primary and principal business.  The license holder would
then be required to annually submit to the issuing authority a report supported
by receipts demonstrating that the sale of food constituted at least 60 percent
of the stores total annual sales in the last full calendar year preceding the
renewal date.  A license holder who fails to demonstrate that the sale of food
constituted at least 60 percent of the stores total annual sales in the last
full calendar year may be subject to revocation of the plenary retail
consumption license.  The bill also requires the license holder to cease the
sale of alcoholic beverages each day at the time that food service has ended or
11:00 p.m., whichever occurs earlier.   A license holder would be entitled to
transfer the license to another person in a private transaction, but the bill
prohibits the license from being relocated to another premises. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also allows a receiving
municipality that has reached the license population limitation established
under current law to issue a request for proposal (RFP) to acquire an inactive
plenary retail consumption license from any license holder in this State. The
bill requires the receiving municipality to issue the license for use in
connection with a premises as part of economic redevelopment plan or a
redevelopment, improvement, or revitalization area. The RFP would <span
style='color:black'>specify a time and date after which no further applications
from license holders will be accepted.  The municipality is to publish the RFP
in a newspaper circulating generally throughout the State by not less than two
insertions, one week apart, the second of which is to be made not less than 30
days prior to the time and date specified in the notice as the time and date
after which no further applications will be accepted.  In addition, the request
for proposal is to be published by the governing body on the official Internet
website of the receiving municipality.   The RFP is to require that all bids be
sealed and remain confidential to other bidders.  The holder of an inactive
plenary retail consumption license is to apply for permission to transfer the
inactive plenary retail consumption license from the sending municipality prior
to submitting a bid in response to the RFP.  </span><span style='font-size:
11.5pt;line-height:150%'>The sending municipality may approve the application
by resolution</span><span style='color:black'>.  The sending municipality would
be prohibited from requiring the applicant to disclose the location of the
proposed licensed premises.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     After
the receiving municipality accepts a successful bid, t</span>he sending and
receiving municipality are to submit to the director notice of the intent to
transfer a license at least 90 days prior to the transfer.  The bill requires
the sending and receiving municipalities to adopt by majority vote identical
resolutions authorizing the transfer of the license.  The identical resolutions
are to establish the license transfer fee agreed upon by both municipal
governing bodies. The bill requires a license that is not actively used within
two years of issuance date to expire.  A receiving municipality that issued the
RFP would be prohibited from acquiring more than one license through this process
in each calendar year.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires the
director to establish a four-year timeline for the reissuance of inactive
licenses based on the length of time that the license has been inactive.  The
plenary retail consumption licenses transferred to or acquired by a receiving
municipality under the bills provisions would not be included in the
population formula used to issue new licenses.</p>
