The board shall not approve a request to increase any component of an electric rate for an electric public utility that fails to demonstrate at least adequate progress towards meeting the benchmarks established pursuant to subsection c. of this section, as assessed by the board at the time of the electric public utilitys base rate case filing.  In the event the board denies an electric public utilitys petition for a rate increase for failing to demonstrate adequate progress towards meeting the benchmarks established pursuant to subsection c. of this section, the board shall provide the electric public utility a copy of its best practices benchmark compliance assessment, which assessment shall include remedial action steps for the electric public utility to take to demonstrate adequate progress. e.     The board shall make periodic revisions to the best practices established pursuant to subsection b. of this section as necessary to reflect the current national, State, and industry standards. f.     The board shall publish its best practices established pursuant to subsection b. of this section on the boards Internet website to be accessible to utilities. g.    The board shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations as may be necessary for the implementation of this act. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately.
