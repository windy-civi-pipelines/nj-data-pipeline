STATEMENT This joint resolution designates the month of May of each year as Law Enforcement and Correctional Police Officer Appreciation Month and calls upon public officials and the residents of New Jersey to observe the month with appropriate activities and programs. In light of recent negativity directed toward law enforcement nationally, this joint resolution appropriately honors law enforcement and correctional police officers. It is the Sponsors intent to ensure that the citizens of New Jersey recognize the difficult career these officers have chosen and that these officers deserve our highest respect and deepest gratitude.
