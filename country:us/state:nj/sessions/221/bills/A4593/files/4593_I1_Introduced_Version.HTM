lives with or provides some component of home care services on a continuing
basis to the elderly person including, but not limited to, a neighbor or friend
who does not provide such services but has access to the elderly person based
on such relationship.  The offense is graded as a crime of the third degree
punishable by up to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both
when the amount involved is at least $200.00 but does not exceed $500.00.
Ordinarily thefts of this amount are graded as crimes of the fourth degree.  The
bill also upgrades theft when the amount is less than $200.00 to a crime of the
fourth degree from a disorderly persons offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Theft from an elderly person
when the amount involved exceeds $500.00 but is less than $75,000.00 continues
