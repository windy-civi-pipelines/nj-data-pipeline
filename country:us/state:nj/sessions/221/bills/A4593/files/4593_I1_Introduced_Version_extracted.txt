Under the bill, a person obtains property by financial exploitation of the elderly when, being a person in a position of trust, he compels or induces an elderly person to deliver such property to him or to a third person by means of fraud, false promise, extortion or intimidation.  "Elderly person" is defined as any person who is 60 years of age or older and is suffering from a disease or infirmity associated with advanced age or who suffers from a mental disease, defect or condition which renders the person incapable of deciding whether to give or withhold consent to taking, obtaining or withholding of his or her property.

Ordinarily thefts of this amount are graded as crimes of the fourth degree.  The bill also upgrades theft when the amount is less than $200.00 to a crime of the fourth degree from a disorderly persons offense. Theft from an elderly person when the amount involved exceeds $500.00 but is less than $75,000.00 continues to be a crime of the third degree.

The amount involved in a theft or computer criminal activity shall be determined by the trier of fact.  The amount shall include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of any State tax avoided, evaded or otherwise unpaid, improperly retained or disposed of. Amounts involved in thefts, thefts of motor vehicles, or computer criminal activities committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether from the same person or several persons, may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense. c.    Claim of right.  It is an affirmative defense to prosecution for theft that the actor: (1) Was unaware that the property or service was that of another; (2) Acted under an honest claim of right to the property or service involved or that he had a right to acquire or dispose of it as he did; or (3) Took property exposed for sale, intending to purchase and pay for it promptly, or reasonably believing that the owner, if present, would have consented. d.    Theft from spouse.  It is no defense that theft or computer criminal activity was from or committed against the actor's spouse, except that misappropriation of household and personal effects, or other property normally accessible to both spouses, is theft or computer criminal activity only if it occurs after the parties have ceased living together. (cf: P.L. 2023, c.101, s.4) 3.    (New section)  Financial exploitation of the elderly. a.    A person obtains property by financial exploitation of the elderly when, being a person in a position of trust, he compels or induces an elderly person to deliver such property to him or to a third person by means of fraud, false promise, extortion or intimidation. b.    No provision of this paragraph shall be deemed to impose criminal liability upon any person who in good faith seeks to assist an elderly person in the management of his property, but through no fault of such person is unable to assist the elderly person. c.    In any prosecution for theft committed by financial exploitation of the elderly, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant did not know, or could not have known, the facts or conditions which render the person an elderly person as defined in subsection w. of N.J.S. 2C:20-1. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill creates the offense of Financial Exploitation of the Elderly. Under the bill, a person obtains property by financial exploitation of the elderly when, being a person in a position of trust, he compels or induces an elderly person to deliver such property to him or to a third person by means of fraud, false promise, extortion or intimidation.  "Elderly person" is defined as any person who is 60 years of age or older and is suffering from a disease or infirmity associated with advanced age or who suffers from a mental disease, defect or condition which renders the person incapable of deciding whether to give or withhold consent to taking, obtaining or withholding of his or her property. A "person in a position of trust" means a person who: (a)   is the parent, spouse, adult child or other relative by blood or affinity of an elderly person; or (b)  is a joint tenant or tenant in common with an elderly person; or  (c) has a fiduciary obligation to an elderly person; or (d)  receives monetary or other valuable consideration for providing care for the elderly person; or  (e) lives with or provides some component of home care services on a continuing basis to the elderly person including, but not limited to, a neighbor or friend who does not provide such services but has access to the elderly person based on such relationship.  The offense is graded as a crime of the third degree punishable by up to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both when the amount involved is at least $200.00 but does not exceed $500.00. Ordinarily thefts of this amount are graded as crimes of the fourth degree.  The bill also upgrades theft when the amount is less than $200.00 to a crime of the fourth degree from a disorderly persons offense. Theft from an elderly person when the amount involved exceeds $500.00 but is less than $75,000.00 continues to be a crime of the third degree.
