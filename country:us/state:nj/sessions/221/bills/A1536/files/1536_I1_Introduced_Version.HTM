<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend and
supplement the law to improve the suicide assessment, response, and treatment
system in the State and strengthen the obligations of health care providers,
law enforcement officers, and insurers with respect to suicide prevention,
response, and care. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would provide, in
particular, for each psychiatric facility, each outpatient mental health
treatment provider, and each suicide or crisis hotline operating in the State
to have specially trained suicide prevention counselors on staff, during all
hours of operation, to assess patients suicide risk and provide suicide
prevention counseling to patients who are deemed to be at risk of suicide.  The
bill would further require the attending physician at a hospital emergency
department to have an on-site suicide prevention counselor assess and provide
assistance to any emergency room patient who is or may be suicidal, and it
would additionally provide for the governing body of each county to appoint a
local suicide prevention response coordinator, who will be responsible for
deploying at least one qualified and locally available suicide prevention
counselor to assist law enforcement at any emergency scene involving a person
who is or may be suicidal.  Finally, the bill would require all health insurance
carriers to provide coverage for the costs that are associated with the suicide
prevention assessments performed and counseling services rendered pursuant to
the bills provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides for suicide
prevention counselors to perform a formal suicide risk assessment of a patient
at the following times:  1) immediately upon a patients initial admission to a
psychiatric facility or upon a patients first clinical encounter with an
outpatient treatment provider; 2) whenever there is reason for attending staff
at a psychiatric facility or outpatient treatment provider to believe that a
patient is developing new suicidal ideations, behaviors, or tendencies while
under the care of the facility or provider; 3) within three days prior to the
discharge of an apparently non-suicidal patient from inpatient care; and 4)
whenever a suicide prevention counselor is called to assess a patient in a
hospital emergency department or at the scene of an emergency, as provided by
the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each suicide risk assessment
conducted under the bill is to be performed using a standardized tool,
methodology, or framework, and is to be based on data obtained from the
patient, as well as pertinent observations made by the attending clinician,
assigned suicide prevention counselors, and other staff members having direct
contact with the patient, and, to the extent practicable, any other information
about the patients history, the patients past, recent, and present suicidal
ideation and behavior, and the factors contributing thereto that is available
from all other relevant sources, including outside treatment professionals,
caseworkers, caregivers, family members, guardians, and any other persons who
are significant in the patients life.  The suicide risk assessment is to include
an evaluation of the patients current living situation, housing status,
existing support systems, and close relationships, and is to indicate whether
there is any evidence that the patient is being subjected to abuse, neglect,
exploitation, or undue influence by family members, caregivers, or other
persons.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The results of a patients
suicide risk assessment and notes regarding the progress of suicide prevention
counseling provided to an at-risk patient are to be documented in the patients
health record.  The bill further specifies that any counseling and treatment
provided to address an at-risk patients suicidal ideations, behaviors, or
tendencies is to be supplemental to any other treatment that is received by the
patient for the patients other mental health issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a suicide prevention
counselor, when assessing a patient outside of an inpatient psychiatric
setting, determines that inpatient treatment may be necessary to address an
at-risk patients suicidal ideations, behaviors, or tendencies, the counselor
will be required to either effectuate the voluntary admission and warm hand-off
of the at-risk patient to an inpatient psychiatric facility or, if the patient
refuses voluntary inpatient admission, effectuate a warm hand-off of the patient
to a screening service or mental health screener to determine whether
involuntary commitment to treatment is warranted.  In cases where the counselor
is providing on-site assistance at an emergency scene or in a hospitals
emergency department, the on-scene law enforcement officers or attending
physician may assist in the warm hand-off of the patient for these purposes. 
For any at-risk patient remaining in outpatient care, suicide prevention
counselors at the outpatient treatment provider will be required to reengage
and provide individualized, one-on-one counseling to each such patient,
commensurate with the results of the patients suicide risk assessment,
whenever the patient has a subsequent clinical encounter with the outpatient
treatment provider.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that,
whenever a law enforcement officer is dispatched in response to a request for
emergency services that involves a person who is or may be suicidal, the police
dispatcher will be responsible for notifying the local suicide prevention response
coordinator, appointed by the countys governing body under the bill, and the
suicide prevention response coordinator will be responsible for ensuring the
contemporaneous deployment of a suicide prevention counselor to the scene of
the emergency.  A&nbsp;9-1-1 call-taker is to determine whether each request
for emergency services involves a person who is or may be suicidal, and the
bill provides for call-takers to undergo training to enable them to make this
determination.  Upon deployment to an emergency scene, a suicide prevention
counselor will be required to:  1) provide assistance to law enforcement on the
scene, as may be necessary to facilitate the non-violent de-escalation of the
emergency situation; 2) perform an on-site suicide risk assessment of the
person in crisis; and 3) immediately use warm hand-offs and the assistance of
law enforcement, as needed, to link the at-risk person to appropriate treatment
facilities, programs, and services, including voluntary or involuntary
inpatient treatment, where warranted.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bills provisions,
each <span style='color:black'>county and municipal law enforcement officer in
the State will be required to complete at least two hours of in-service
training in identifying the signs of mental illness and appropriate response
techniques to be followed when interacting with a person who is or may be suicidal. 
The training is required to include: (1) the importance of approaching a suicidal
person in a calm, gentle, and respectful manner; (2) the importance of avoiding
the use of unnecessary force and the importance of using verbal methods of
communication and other non-violent means to de-escalate an emergency situation
involving a person who is or may be suicidal; and (3) specific techniques,
means, and methods, consistent with the principles identified in the bill, that
are to be employed by law enforcement officers when approaching, communicating
with, engaging in physical contact or the use of force with, and de-escalating
a situation involving, a person who is or may be suicidal.  The in-service
training is also to include simulated role-playing scenarios, which will allow
trainees to demonstrate their ability to effectively interact with, and
de-escalate emergency situations involving, a person who is or may be suicidal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require each
inpatient psychiatric facility and each outpatient mental health treatment
provider to establish policies and protocols to provide for the effective,
compassionate, and responsible discharge of at-risk patients from care and the
smooth transition of at-risk patients through the continuum of care using warm
hand-offs, rapid referrals, and supportive contacts.  Each outpatient provider
will additionally be required to adopt policies and protocols providing for the
warm hand-off of an at-risk patient to an inpatient psychiatric facility or to
a screening service or mental health screener, as appropriate, in any case where
the patients suicide prevention counselor or attending clinician has reason to
believe that the patient may require voluntary or involuntary commitment to
inpatient treatment to address the patients suicidal ideations, behaviors, and
tendencies or associated mental health issues.  The bill authorizes a facility
or provider to enter into contracts or memoranda of understanding with outside
organizations, including local crisis centers and other psychiatric facilities
and providers, in order to facilitate the smooth and effective care transition
of at-risk patients as provided by the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires a
psychiatric facility or outpatient treatment provider to facilitate the
biennial training of all staff on the following issues:  1) the fundamentals of
the facilitys suicide prevention policies and protocols; 2) the particular
suicide care policies and protocols that are relevant to each staff members
role and responsibilities; 3) the signs and symptoms that can be used by both
clinical and non-clinical staff to identify existing patients who may be
developing new suicidal ideations, behaviors, or tendencies; 4) the importance
of, and methods and principles to be used in, ensuring the safe and responsible
discharge and care transition of at-risk patients; and 5) the respectful
treatment of, effective communication with, and de-stigmatization of, at-risk
patients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would prohibit a
staff member of a psychiatric facility or outpatient treatment provider from: 
1) discharging an at-risk patient into a homeless situation; or 2) having an
at-risk patient arrested or incarcerated in a jail or prison, unless the
at-risk patient poses an otherwise uncontrollable risk to others.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would additionally
require a suicide prevention counselor and any other staff member employed by a
psychiatric facility, by an outpatient treatment provider, or by a suicide or
crisis hotline, as well as any other health care professional, when interacting
with an at-risk patient, to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    treat the at-risk patient
with the same dignity and respect that is shown to other patients;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    adopt a stance that
reflects empathy, compassion, and an understanding of the ambivalence the
at-risk patient may feel in relation to the patients desire to die; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)    treat the at-risk
patient in an age-appropriate manner and using methods of communication that
the patient can understand;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4)    attempt to engender
confidence in the at-risk patient that there is an alternative to suicide, and
encourage the patient to use all available services and resources to empower
the patient to choose such an alternative;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5)    not engage in activities
or communication methods that may result in the increased traumatization or
re-traumatization of the at-risk patient; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6)    not engage in the psychological
testing of an at-risk patient who is in crisis or who has recently been lifted
out of a crisis situation (except in the case of a suicide risk assessment
performed pursuant to the bill); and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7)    not engage in behavior
that discriminates against or stigmatizes the patient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any person who violates these
minimum standards of compassionate care will be personally liable to pay a
civil penalty of not more than $500 for a first offense, not more than $1,000
for a second offense, and not more than $2,500 for a third or subsequent
offense, to be collected in a summary proceeding.  Such person will also be
subject to:  1) potential criminal liability and civil lawsuits, including
lawsuits for punitive damages, for any injury that is proximately caused thereby;
2) the suspension or revocation of the persons professional license or
certification; 3) the revocation of the persons mental health accreditation;
and 4) the termination of the persons employment.</p>
