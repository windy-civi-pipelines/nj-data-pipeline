(3)   The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide service of process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. (b)   Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination. (1)   If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall: (A)   provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action to be taken by the commission; and (B)    provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2)   If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. (3)   Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting states legislature, and each of the member states. (4)   A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. (5)   The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state. (6)   The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices.  The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees. (c)   Dispute Resolution. (1)   Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member states. (2)   The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate. (d)   Enforcement. (1)   The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact. (2)   By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a member state in default, in order to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member state shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees. (3)   The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission.  The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law. XIV.     Date of Implementation of the Interstate Commission for EMS Personnel Practice and Associated Rules, Withdrawal, and Amendment. (a)   The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state.  The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules.  Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact. (b)   Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commissions initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state.  Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. (c)   Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. (1)   A member states withdrawal shall not take effect until 6 months after enactment of the repealing statute.

STATEMENT This bill enters New Jersey into the Recognition Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Personnel Licensure Interstate Compact (otherwise known as REPLICA). This compact is intended to facilitate the day-to-day movement of EMS personnel across state boundaries in the performance of their EMS duties as assigned by an appropriate authority and authorize state EMS offices to afford immediate legal recognition to EMS personnel licensed in a member state.  This compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the publics health and safety through their licensing and regulation of EMS personnel, and that such state regulation shared among the member states will best protect public health and safety. REPLICA is the nation's first and only multi-state compact for the EMS profession. REPLICA provides qualified EMS professionals licensed in a "home state" a legal "privilege to practice" in "remote states."  Home states are states where an EMT is licensed; while remote states are other states that have adopted the REPLICA legislation.

(3)   The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide service of process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. (b)   Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination. (1)   If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall: (A)   provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action to be taken by the commission; and (B)    provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2)   If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. (3)   Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting states legislature, and each of the member states. (4)   A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. (5)   The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state. (6)   The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices.  The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees. (c)   Dispute Resolution. (1)   Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member states. (2)   The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate. (d)   Enforcement. (1)   The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact. (2)   By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a member state in default, in order to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member state shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees. (3)   The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission.  The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law. XIV.     Date of Implementation of the Interstate Commission for EMS Personnel Practice and Associated Rules, Withdrawal, and Amendment. (a)   The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state.  The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules.  Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact. (b)   Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commissions initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state.  Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. (c)   Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same. (1)   A member states withdrawal shall not take effect until 6 months after enactment of the repealing statute. (2)   Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing states EMS authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (d)   Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. (e)   This compact may be amended by the member states.  No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. XV.     Construction and Severability.  This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states.  Nothing in this compact supersedes state law or rules related to the licensure of EMS agencies. 2.    Nothing in this compact shall be deemed to waive or abrogate in any way any defense or immunity of a public entity or public employee under the common law or statutory law including, but not limited to, the "New Jersey Tort Claims Act," 25 N.J.S.59:1-1 et seq. 3.    The Governor may withdraw this State from the compact if the Attorney General notifies the Governor that a state that is a party to the compact has changed its licensure requirements to make them substantially lower than the requirements of this State, or that withdrawal from the compact is in the best interests of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this State. 4.    This act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill enters New Jersey into the Recognition Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Personnel Licensure Interstate Compact (otherwise known as REPLICA). This compact is intended to facilitate the day-to-day movement of EMS personnel across state boundaries in the performance of their EMS duties as assigned by an appropriate authority and authorize state EMS offices to afford immediate legal recognition to EMS personnel licensed in a member state.  This compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the publics health and safety through their licensing and regulation of EMS personnel, and that such state regulation shared among the member states will best protect public health and safety. REPLICA is the nation's first and only multi-state compact for the EMS profession. REPLICA provides qualified EMS professionals licensed in a "home state" a legal "privilege to practice" in "remote states."  Home states are states where an EMT is licensed; while remote states are other states that have adopted the REPLICA legislation.
