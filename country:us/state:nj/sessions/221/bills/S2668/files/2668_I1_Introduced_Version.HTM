join in the compact in the form substantially as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     I.     Purpose.      In order
to protect the public through the verification of competency and ensure
accountability for patient care-related activities, all states license
emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, such as emergency medical
technicians (EMTs), advanced EMTs, and paramedics.  This compact is intended to
facilitate the day-to-day movement of EMS personnel across state boundaries in
the performance of their EMS duties as assigned by an appropriate authority,
and authorize state EMS offices to afford immediate legal recognition to EMS
personnel licensed in a member state.  This compact recognizes that states have
a vested interest in protecting the publics health and safety through their
licensing and regulation of EMS personnel, and that such state regulation
shared among the member states will best protect public health and safety. This
compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Support the licensing of
military members who are separating from an active duty tour, and their
spouses;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   Facilitate the exchange
of information between member states regarding EMS personnel licensure, adverse
action, and significant investigatory information;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   Promote compliance with
the laws governing EMS personnel practice in each member state; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   Invest all member states
with the authority to hold EMS personnel accountable through the mutual
recognition of member state licenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

it so chooses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Nothing in this section

event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule.  For the

revision results in a material change to a rule.  A challenge shall be made in
writing, and delivered to the chair of the commission prior to the end of the
notice period.  If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without
further action.  If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   Oversight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The executive,
legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state
shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to
effectuate the compacts purposes and intent.  The provisions of this compact
and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   All courts shall take
judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative
proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact

entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have
standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to

void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.</p>

Assistance, and Termination.</p>

obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules,
the commission shall:</p>

training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   If a state in default
fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all
rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on
the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the
offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
default.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Termination of
membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of
securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or
terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and
minority leaders of the defaulting states legislature, and each of the member
states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A state that has been
terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
extend beyond the effective date of termination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   The commission shall not
bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has
been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
commission and the defaulting state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The defaulting state may
appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission
has its principal offices.  The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of
such litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Dispute Resolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Upon request by a member
state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact
that arise among member states and between member and non-member states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The commission shall
promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution
for disputes, as appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Enforcement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The commission, in the
reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules
of this compact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   By majority vote, the
commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
principal offices against a member state in default, in order to enforce
compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and
bylaws.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In
the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member state shall
be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The remedies herein
shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission.  The commission may
pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.</p>

Implementation of the Interstate Commission for EMS Personnel Practice and
Associated Rules, Withdrawal, and Amendment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The compact shall come
into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the
tenth member state.  The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall

promulgation of rules.  Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise
rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the
compact.  </p>

withdrawal shall not take effect until 6 months after enactment of the
repealing statute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Withdrawal shall not
affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing states EMS authority to
comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this
act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Nothing contained in
this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any EMS personnel
licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and
a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   This compact may be
amended by the member states.  No amendment to this compact shall become
effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws
of all member states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     XV.     Construction and
Severability.  This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate
the purposes thereof.  If this compact shall be held contrary to the

force and effect as to the remaining member states.  Nothing in this compact
supersedes state law or rules related to the licensure of EMS agencies.</p>

health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this State.</p>

into the Recognition Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Personnel Licensure
Interstate Compact (otherwise known as REPLICA). This compact is intended to
facilitate the day-to-day movement of EMS personnel across state boundaries in
the performance of their EMS duties as assigned by an appropriate authority and
authorize state EMS offices to afford immediate legal recognition to EMS
personnel licensed in a member state.  This compact recognizes that states have
a vested interest in protecting the publics health and safety through their
licensing and regulation of EMS personnel, and that such state regulation
shared among the member states will best protect public health and safety. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     REPLICA is the nation's first
and only multi-state compact for the EMS profession. REPLICA provides qualified
EMS professionals licensed in a &quot;home state&quot; a legal &quot;privilege

an EMT is licensed; while remote states are other states that have adopted the
REPLICA legislation.</p>
