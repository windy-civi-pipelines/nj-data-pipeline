Withholding or Imposing Sentence of Imprisonment.  a.  In determining the
appropriate sentence to be imposed on a person who has been convicted of an
offense, the court shall consider the following aggravating circumstances:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The nature and
circumstances of the offense, and the role of the actor therein, including
whether or not it was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved
manner;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The gravity and
seriousness of harm inflicted on the victim, including whether or not the
defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim of the offense
was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance due to advanced age,
ill-health, or extreme youth, or was for any other reason substantially
incapable of exercising normal physical or mental power of resistance;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The risk that the
defendant will commit another offense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A lesser sentence will
depreciate the seriousness of the defendant's offense because it involved a
breach of the public trust under chapters 27 and 30, or the defendant took
advantage of a position of trust or confidence to commit the offense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   There is a substantial
likelihood that the defendant is involved in organized criminal activity;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The extent of the
defendant's prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses of which
he has been convicted;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   The defendant committed
the offense pursuant to an agreement that he either pay or be paid for the
commission of the offense and the pecuniary incentive was beyond that inherent
in the offense itself;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   The defendant committed
the offense against a police or other law enforcement officer, correctional
employee or fireman, acting in the performance of his duties while in uniform
or exhibiting evidence of his authority; the defendant committed the offense because
of the status of the victim as a public servant; or the defendant committed the
offense against a sports official, athletic coach or manager, acting in or
immediately following the performance of his duties or because of the person's
status as a sports official, coach or manager;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   The need for deterring
the defendant and others from violating the law; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10) The offense involved
fraudulent or deceptive practices committed against any department or division
of State government;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11) The imposition of a fine,
penalty or order of restitution without also imposing a term of imprisonment
would be perceived by the defendant or others merely as part of the cost of
doing business, or as an acceptable contingent business or operating expense
associated with the initial decision to resort to unlawful practices; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (12) The defendant committed
the offense against a person who he knew or should have known was 60 years of
age or older, or disabled; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (13) The defendant, while in
the course of committing or attempting to commit the crime, including the
immediate flight therefrom, used or was in possession of a stolen motor
vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      b.   In determining the
appropriate sentence to be imposed on a person who has been convicted of an
offense, the court may properly consider the following mitigating
circumstances:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The defendant's conduct
neither caused nor threatened serious harm;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The defendant did not
contemplate that his conduct would cause or threaten serious harm;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The defendant acted
under a strong provocation;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   There were substantial
grounds tending to excuse or justify the defendant's conduct, though failing to
establish a defense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   The victim of the
defendant's conduct induced or facilitated its commission;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The defendant has
compensated or will compensate the victim of his conduct for the damage or
injury that he sustained, or will participate in a program of community
service;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   The defendant has no
history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law-abiding life
for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present offense; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   The defendant's conduct
was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   The character and
attitude of the defendant indicate that he is unlikely to commit another offense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  The defendant is
particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probationary treatment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11)  The imprisonment of the
defendant would entail excessive hardship to himself or his dependents;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (12)  The willingness of the
defendant to cooperate with law enforcement authorities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (13)  The conduct of a
youthful defendant was substantially influenced by another person more mature
than the defendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      c.    (1)  A plea of guilty
by a defendant or failure to so plead shall not be considered in withholding or
imposing a sentence of imprisonment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   When imposing a sentence
of imprisonment the court shall consider the defendant's eligibility for
release under the law governing parole, including time credits awarded pursuant
to Title 30 of the Revised Statutes, in determining the appropriate term of
imprisonment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Presumption of
imprisonment.  The court shall deal with a person who has been convicted of a
crime of the first or second degree by imposing a sentence of imprisonment
unless, having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of
the opinion that his imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides
the need to deter such conduct by others. Notwithstanding the provisions of
subsection e. of this section, the court shall deal with a person who has been
convicted of theft of a motor vehicle or of the unlawful taking of a motor
vehicle and who has previously been convicted of either offense by imposing a
sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and condition
of the defendant, it is of the opinion that his imprisonment would be a serious
injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The court shall deal
with a person convicted of an offense other than a crime of the first or second
degree, who has not previously been convicted of an offense, without imposing a
sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the nature and circumstances
of the offense and the history, character and condition of the defendant, it is
of the opinion that his imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the
public under the criteria set forth in subsection a., except that this
subsection shall not apply if the person is convicted of any of the following
crimes of the third degree: theft of a motor vehicle; unlawful taking of a
motor vehicle; eluding; if the person is convicted of a crime of the third
degree constituting use of a false government  document in violation of
subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.1983, c.565 (C.2C:21-2.1); if the person is
convicted of a crime of the third degree constituting distribution, manufacture
or possession of an item containing personal identifying  information in
violation of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.2003, c.184 (C.2C:21-17.3); or
if the person is convicted of a crime of the third or fourth degree
constituting bias intimidation in violation of N.J.S.2C:16-1; or if the person
is convicted of a crime of the third  degree under  section 2 of P.L.1997,
c.111 (C.2C:12-1.1).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Presumptive Sentences. 
(1)  Except for the crime of murder, unless the preponderance of aggravating or
mitigating factors, as set forth in subsections a. and b., weighs in favor of a
higher or lower term within the limits provided in N.J.S.2C:43-6, when a court
determines that a sentence of imprisonment is warranted, it shall impose
sentence as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   To a term of 20 years
for aggravated manslaughter or kidnapping pursuant to paragraph (1) of
subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:13-1 when the offense constitutes a crime of the
first degree;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Except as provided in
paragraph (a) of this subsection to a term of 15 years for a crime of the first
degree;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   To a term of seven years
for a crime of the second degree;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   To a term of four years
for a crime of the third degree; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   To a term of nine months
for a crime of the fourth degree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In imposing a minimum term
pursuant to 2C:43-6b., the sentencing court shall specifically place on the
record the aggravating factors set forth in this section which justify the
imposition of a minimum term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Unless the preponderance of
mitigating factors set forth in subsection b. weighs in favor of a lower term
within the limits authorized, sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(1) shall
have a presumptive term of life imprisonment.  Unless the preponderance of
aggravating and mitigating factors set forth in subsections a. and b. weighs in
favor of a higher or lower term within the limits authorized, sentences imposed
pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(2) shall have a presumptive term of 50 years' imprisonment;
sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(3) shall have a presumptive term of 15
years' imprisonment; and sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(4) shall have
a presumptive term of seven years' imprisonment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In imposing a minimum term
pursuant to 2C:43-7b., the sentencing court shall specifically place on the
record the aggravating factors set forth in this section which justify the
imposition of a minimum term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In cases of convictions
for crimes of the first or second degree where the court is clearly convinced
that the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors and
where the interest of justice demands, the court may sentence the defendant to
a term appropriate to a crime of one degree lower than that of the crime for
which he was convicted.  If the court does impose sentence pursuant to this
paragraph, or if the court imposes a noncustodial or probationary sentence upon
conviction for a crime of the first or second degree, such sentence shall not
become final for 10 days in order to permit the appeal of such sentence by the
prosecution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Imposition of
Noncustodial Sentences in Certain Cases.  If the court, in considering the
aggravating factors set forth in subsection a., finds the aggravating factor in
paragraph a.(2) or a.(12) and does not impose a custodial sentence, the court
shall specifically place on the record the mitigating factors which justify the
imposition of a noncustodial sentence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Except as provided in
section 2 of P.L.1993, c.123 (C.2C:43-11), the presumption of imprisonment as

Compensation Board as a result of the commission of the offense and, in any

for which the defendant is being sentenced.  The statement may include the
nature and extent of any physical harm or psychological or emotional harm or
trauma suffered by the victim, the extent of any loss to include loss of
earnings or ability to work suffered by the victim and the effect of the crime
upon the victim's family.  The probation department shall notify the victim or
nearest relative of a homicide victim of his right to make a statement for
inclusion in the presentence report if the victim or relative so desires.  Any
such statement shall be made within 20 days of notification by the probation
department.  </p>

concerning real child pornography.  This new subsection:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   makes it a crime of the
second degree to use any device, including a computer, to produce, create, or
reproduce an image which appears to depict a child in a obscene prohibited
sexual act or in a simulation of such an act;   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   makes it a crime of the
second degree to knowingly distribute obscene virtual child pornography; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   makes it a crime of the
third degree to knowingly possess obscene virtual child pornography;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   defines an obscene
depiction to be one in which:  a sexual act is patently offensive; lacks
serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value when taken as a
whole; and is part of a work which, taken as a whole in light of contemporary
community standards, appeals to the prurient interest; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   specifies that when
virtual child pornography is obscene, the defendant is strictly liable; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Other provisions of the bill: 
require defendants to be reviewed for referral to the Adult Diagnostic and
Treatment Center if convicted of certain real and virtual child pornography
crimes; prohibit expungement of criminal records; provide for notification to
the prosecuting agency and victim when a defendant is placed in a community
release program or released from incarceration; and require certain repeat
offenders presentence and parole eligibility report to include a complete
psychological evaluation for repeat offenders. The bill also eliminates the
presumption of nonincarceration, normally applicable to third degree crimes,
for the crime of possessing real or virtual child pornography.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill includes a fixed
mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for certain recidivists who violate
N.J.S.2C:24-4.  Defendants convicted of engaging in sexual conduct which would
impair or debauch the morals of a child in violation of subsection a. of
N.J.S.2C:24&#8209;4 or of child pornography crimes under subsection b. or c. of
N.J.S.2C:24-4 must be sentenced to prison and serve one&#8209;third to one-half
of their sentences before being eligible for parole if they have previously
been convicted of other sex crimes including luring or enticing a child, sexual
assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, or child endangerment.  The bill
also makes a prior conviction under N.J.S.2C:24-4 the basis for a mandatory
minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-6, and provides that the
minimum term must be imposed regardless of whether the defendant is sentenced
to an extended term of imprisonment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill amends
various other statutes to ensure that virtual child pornographers are subject
to the same penalties as real child pornographers.  Thus, wherever a statute
specifically refers to a provision of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:24-4, this bill
adds subsection c. to the statute.</p>
