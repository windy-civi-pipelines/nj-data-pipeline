(2)   When imposing a sentence of imprisonment the court shall consider the defendant's eligibility for release under the law governing parole, including time credits awarded pursuant to Title 30 of the Revised Statutes, in determining the appropriate term of imprisonment. d.    Presumption of imprisonment.  The court shall deal with a person who has been convicted of a crime of the first or second degree by imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that his imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of this section, the court shall deal with a person who has been convicted of theft of a motor vehicle or of the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle and who has previously been convicted of either offense by imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that his imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others. e.     The court shall deal with a person convicted of an offense other than a crime of the first or second degree, who has not previously been convicted of an offense, without imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history, character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that his imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public under the criteria set forth in subsection a., except that this subsection shall not apply if the person is convicted of any of the following crimes of the third degree: theft of a motor vehicle; unlawful taking of a motor vehicle; eluding; if the person is convicted of a crime of the third degree constituting use of a false government  document in violation of subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.1983, c.565 (C.2C:21-2.1); if the person is convicted of a crime of the third degree constituting distribution, manufacture or possession of an item containing personal identifying  information in violation of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.2003, c.184 (C.2C:21-17.3); or if the person is convicted of a crime of the third or fourth degree constituting bias intimidation in violation of N.J.S.2C:16-1; or if the person is convicted of a crime of the third  degree under  section 2 of P.L.1997, c.111 (C.2C:12-1.1). f.     Presumptive Sentences. (1)  Except for the crime of murder, unless the preponderance of aggravating or mitigating factors, as set forth in subsections a. and b., weighs in favor of a higher or lower term within the limits provided in N.J.S.2C:43-6, when a court determines that a sentence of imprisonment is warranted, it shall impose sentence as follows: (a)   To a term of 20 years for aggravated manslaughter or kidnapping pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:13-1 when the offense constitutes a crime of the first degree; (b)   Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection to a term of 15 years for a crime of the first degree; (c)   To a term of seven years for a crime of the second degree; (d)   To a term of four years for a crime of the third degree; and (e)   To a term of nine months for a crime of the fourth degree. In imposing a minimum term pursuant to 2C:43-6b., the sentencing court shall specifically place on the record the aggravating factors set forth in this section which justify the imposition of a minimum term. Unless the preponderance of mitigating factors set forth in subsection b. weighs in favor of a lower term within the limits authorized, sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(1) shall have a presumptive term of life imprisonment.  Unless the preponderance of aggravating and mitigating factors set forth in subsections a. and b. weighs in favor of a higher or lower term within the limits authorized, sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(2) shall have a presumptive term of 50 years' imprisonment; sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(3) shall have a presumptive term of 15 years' imprisonment; and sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(4) shall have a presumptive term of seven years' imprisonment. In imposing a minimum term pursuant to 2C:43-7b., the sentencing court shall specifically place on the record the aggravating factors set forth in this section which justify the imposition of a minimum term. (2)   In cases of convictions for crimes of the first or second degree where the court is clearly convinced that the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors and where the interest of justice demands, the court may sentence the defendant to a term appropriate to a crime of one degree lower than that of the crime for which he was convicted.  If the court does impose sentence pursuant to this paragraph, or if the court imposes a noncustodial or probationary sentence upon conviction for a crime of the first or second degree, such sentence shall not become final for 10 days in order to permit the appeal of such sentence by the prosecution. g.    Imposition of Noncustodial Sentences in Certain Cases.  If the court, in considering the aggravating factors set forth in subsection a., finds the aggravating factor in paragraph a.(2) or a.(12) and does not impose a custodial sentence, the court shall specifically place on the record the mitigating factors which justify the imposition of a noncustodial sentence. h.    Except as provided in section 2 of P.L.1993, c.123 (C.2C:43-11), the presumption of imprisonment as provided in subsection d. of this section shall not preclude the admission of a person to the Intensive Supervision Program, established pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey.

(cf:  P.L.2001, c.79, s.8) 11.  Section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54) is amended to read as follows: 10.  a.  At least 120 days but not more than 180 days prior to the parole eligibility date of each adult inmate, a report concerning the inmate shall be filed with the appropriate board panel, by the staff members designated by the superintendent or other chief executive officer of the institution in which the inmate is held. b.    (1)  The report filed pursuant to subsection a. shall contain preincarceration records of the inmate, including any history of civil commitment, any disposition which arose out of any charges suspended pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-6 including records of the disposition of those charges and any acquittals by reason of insanity pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-1, state the conduct of the inmate during the current period of confinement, include a complete report on the inmate's social and physical condition, include an investigation by the Division of Parole of the inmate's parole plans, and present information bearing upon the likelihood that the inmate will commit a crime under the laws of this State if released on parole.

The report may include a written or videotaped statement concerning the continuing nature and extent of any physical harm or psychological or emotional harm or trauma suffered by the victim, the extent of any loss of earnings or ability to work suffered by the victim and the continuing effect of the crime upon the victim's family.  At the time public notice is given that an inmate is being considered  for  parole pursuant  to  this section, the board shall also notify any victim or nearest relative who has previously contacted the board of the availability to provide a written or videotaped statement for inclusion in the parole report or to present testimony at the parole hearing.

(cf:  P.L.2001, c.141, s.3) 12.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill revises the States laws governing child pornography. The bill modifies subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:24-4, concerning real child pornography to include: (1)   upgrading to a first degree crime for all persons, not just parents and guardians, causing or permitting a child to engage in or simulation of a prohibited sexual act knowing that the act would be photographed or reproduced; (2)   explicitly stating that an intent to distribute, advertise, offer or agree to offer is not an element of creating or reproducing child pornography and clarifying that the elements of this offense include producing, creating, copying or duplicating images of child pornography, or posting those images on the Internet; (3)   clarifying that possessing child pornography for the purpose of distributing it is a second degree crime and streamlining the definition of distribute; (4)   upgrading possession of child pornography to a crime of the third degree; and (5)   establishing a rebuttable presumption that a person appearing to be a child in a photo, video, or computer file, is in fact an actual child; (6)   requiring defendants who intend to defend a charge of child pornography by claiming that it was created without using an actual child, or the face or any of the intimate parts of an actual child, or depicts the image of a person who is not a child, to notify the prosecutor of that claim in accordance with the Rules of Court; and (7)   allowing the admissibility of hearsay evidence to be used to establish the existence, identity and age of an actual child depicted in child pornography. The bill also adds a new subsection c. to N.J.S.2C:24-4 to establish the crime of virtual child pornography, the provisions of which parallel the provisions of subsection b. concerning real child pornography.  This new subsection: (1)   makes it a crime of the second degree to use any device, including a computer, to produce, create, or reproduce an image which appears to depict a child in a obscene prohibited sexual act or in a simulation of such an act; (2)   makes it a crime of the second degree to knowingly distribute obscene virtual child pornography; (3)   makes it a crime of the third degree to knowingly possess obscene virtual child pornography; (4)   defines an obscene depiction to be one in which:  a sexual act is patently offensive; lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value when taken as a whole; and is part of a work which, taken as a whole in light of contemporary community standards, appeals to the prurient interest; and (5)   specifies that when virtual child pornography is obscene, the defendant is strictly liable; Other provisions of the bill: require defendants to be reviewed for referral to the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center if convicted of certain real and virtual child pornography crimes; prohibit expungement of criminal records; provide for notification to the prosecuting agency and victim when a defendant is placed in a community release program or released from incarceration; and require certain repeat offenders presentence and parole eligibility report to include a complete psychological evaluation for repeat offenders. The bill also eliminates the presumption of nonincarceration, normally applicable to third degree crimes, for the crime of possessing real or virtual child pornography. The bill includes a fixed mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for certain recidivists who violate N.J.S.2C:24-4.  Defendants convicted of engaging in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of a child in violation of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:24‑4 or of child pornography crimes under subsection b. or c. of N.J.S.2C:24-4 must be sentenced to prison and serve one‑third to one-half of their sentences before being eligible for parole if they have previously been convicted of other sex crimes including luring or enticing a child, sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, or child endangerment.  The bill also makes a prior conviction under N.J.S.2C:24-4 the basis for a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-6, and provides that the minimum term must be imposed regardless of whether the defendant is sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment. Finally, the bill amends various other statutes to ensure that virtual child pornographers are subject to the same penalties as real child pornographers.  Thus, wherever a statute specifically refers to a provision of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:24-4, this bill adds subsection c. to the statute.

Criteria for Withholding or Imposing Sentence of Imprisonment.  a.  In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on a person who has been convicted of an offense, the court shall consider the following aggravating circumstances: (1)   The nature and circumstances of the offense, and the role of the actor therein, including whether or not it was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner; (2)   The gravity and seriousness of harm inflicted on the victim, including whether or not the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim of the offense was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance due to advanced age, ill-health, or extreme youth, or was for any other reason substantially incapable of exercising normal physical or mental power of resistance; (3)   The risk that the defendant will commit another offense; (4)   A lesser sentence will depreciate the seriousness of the defendant's offense because it involved a breach of the public trust under chapters 27 and 30, or the defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence to commit the offense; (5)   There is a substantial likelihood that the defendant is involved in organized criminal activity; (6)   The extent of the defendant's prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses of which he has been convicted; (7)   The defendant committed the offense pursuant to an agreement that he either pay or be paid for the commission of the offense and the pecuniary incentive was beyond that inherent in the offense itself; (8)   The defendant committed the offense against a police or other law enforcement officer, correctional employee or fireman, acting in the performance of his duties while in uniform or exhibiting evidence of his authority; the defendant committed the offense because of the status of the victim as a public servant; or the defendant committed the offense against a sports official, athletic coach or manager, acting in or immediately following the performance of his duties or because of the person's status as a sports official, coach or manager; (9)   The need for deterring the defendant and others from violating the law; (10) The offense involved fraudulent or deceptive practices committed against any department or division of State government; (11) The imposition of a fine, penalty or order of restitution without also imposing a term of imprisonment would be perceived by the defendant or others merely as part of the cost of doing business, or as an acceptable contingent business or operating expense associated with the initial decision to resort to unlawful practices; (12) The defendant committed the offense against a person who he knew or should have known was 60 years of age or older, or disabled; and (13) The defendant, while in the course of committing or attempting to commit the crime, including the immediate flight therefrom, used or was in possession of a stolen motor vehicle. b.   In determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on a person who has been convicted of an offense, the court may properly consider the following mitigating circumstances: (1)   The defendant's conduct neither caused nor threatened serious harm; (2)   The defendant did not contemplate that his conduct would cause or threaten serious harm; (3)   The defendant acted under a strong provocation; (4)   There were substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the defendant's conduct, though failing to establish a defense; (5)   The victim of the defendant's conduct induced or facilitated its commission; (6)   The defendant has compensated or will compensate the victim of his conduct for the damage or injury that he sustained, or will participate in a program of community service; (7)   The defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present offense; (8)   The defendant's conduct was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur; (9)   The character and attitude of the defendant indicate that he is unlikely to commit another offense; (10)  The defendant is particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probationary treatment; (11)  The imprisonment of the defendant would entail excessive hardship to himself or his dependents; (12)  The willingness of the defendant to cooperate with law enforcement authorities; (13)  The conduct of a youthful defendant was substantially influenced by another person more mature than the defendant. c.    (1)  A plea of guilty by a defendant or failure to so plead shall not be considered in withholding or imposing a sentence of imprisonment. (2)   When imposing a sentence of imprisonment the court shall consider the defendant's eligibility for release under the law governing parole, including time credits awarded pursuant to Title 30 of the Revised Statutes, in determining the appropriate term of imprisonment. d.    Presumption of imprisonment.  The court shall deal with a person who has been convicted of a crime of the first or second degree by imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that his imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of this section, the court shall deal with a person who has been convicted of theft of a motor vehicle or of the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle and who has previously been convicted of either offense by imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that his imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others. e.     The court shall deal with a person convicted of an offense other than a crime of the first or second degree, who has not previously been convicted of an offense, without imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history, character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that his imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public under the criteria set forth in subsection a., except that this subsection shall not apply if the person is convicted of any of the following crimes of the third degree: theft of a motor vehicle; unlawful taking of a motor vehicle; eluding; if the person is convicted of a crime of the third degree constituting use of a false government  document in violation of subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.1983, c.565 (C.2C:21-2.1); if the person is convicted of a crime of the third degree constituting distribution, manufacture or possession of an item containing personal identifying  information in violation of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.2003, c.184 (C.2C:21-17.3); or if the person is convicted of a crime of the third or fourth degree constituting bias intimidation in violation of N.J.S.2C:16-1; or if the person is convicted of a crime of the third  degree under  section 2 of P.L.1997, c.111 (C.2C:12-1.1). f.     Presumptive Sentences. (1)  Except for the crime of murder, unless the preponderance of aggravating or mitigating factors, as set forth in subsections a. and b., weighs in favor of a higher or lower term within the limits provided in N.J.S.2C:43-6, when a court determines that a sentence of imprisonment is warranted, it shall impose sentence as follows: (a)   To a term of 20 years for aggravated manslaughter or kidnapping pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:13-1 when the offense constitutes a crime of the first degree; (b)   Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection to a term of 15 years for a crime of the first degree; (c)   To a term of seven years for a crime of the second degree; (d)   To a term of four years for a crime of the third degree; and (e)   To a term of nine months for a crime of the fourth degree. In imposing a minimum term pursuant to 2C:43-6b., the sentencing court shall specifically place on the record the aggravating factors set forth in this section which justify the imposition of a minimum term. Unless the preponderance of mitigating factors set forth in subsection b. weighs in favor of a lower term within the limits authorized, sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(1) shall have a presumptive term of life imprisonment.  Unless the preponderance of aggravating and mitigating factors set forth in subsections a. and b. weighs in favor of a higher or lower term within the limits authorized, sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(2) shall have a presumptive term of 50 years' imprisonment; sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(3) shall have a presumptive term of 15 years' imprisonment; and sentences imposed pursuant to 2C:43-7a.(4) shall have a presumptive term of seven years' imprisonment. In imposing a minimum term pursuant to 2C:43-7b., the sentencing court shall specifically place on the record the aggravating factors set forth in this section which justify the imposition of a minimum term. (2)   In cases of convictions for crimes of the first or second degree where the court is clearly convinced that the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors and where the interest of justice demands, the court may sentence the defendant to a term appropriate to a crime of one degree lower than that of the crime for which he was convicted.  If the court does impose sentence pursuant to this paragraph, or if the court imposes a noncustodial or probationary sentence upon conviction for a crime of the first or second degree, such sentence shall not become final for 10 days in order to permit the appeal of such sentence by the prosecution. g.    Imposition of Noncustodial Sentences in Certain Cases.  If the court, in considering the aggravating factors set forth in subsection a., finds the aggravating factor in paragraph a.(2) or a.(12) and does not impose a custodial sentence, the court shall specifically place on the record the mitigating factors which justify the imposition of a noncustodial sentence. h.    Except as provided in section 2 of P.L.1993, c.123 (C.2C:43-11), the presumption of imprisonment as provided in subsection d. of this section shall not preclude the admission of a person to the Intensive Supervision Program, established pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey. (cf:  P.L. 2007, c.83, s.3.) 6.    N.J.S.2C:44-6 is amended to read as follows: 2C:44-6.     Procedure on Sentence; Presentence Investigation and Report. a.     The court shall not impose sentence without first ordering a presentence investigation of the defendant and according due consideration to a written report of such investigation when required by the Rules of Court.  The court may order a presentence investigation in any other case. b.    The presentence investigation shall include an analysis of the circumstances attending the commission of the offense, the defendant's history of delinquency or criminality, family situation, financial resources, including whether or not the defendant is an enrollee or covered person under a health insurance contract, policy or plan, debts, including any amount owed for a fine, assessment or restitution ordered in accordance with the provisions of Title 2C, employment history, personal habits, the disposition of any charge made against any codefendants, the defendant's history of civil commitment, any disposition which arose out of charges suspended pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-6 including the records of the disposition of those charges and any acquittal by reason of insanity pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-1, and any other matters that the probation officer deems relevant or the court directs to be included.  The defendant shall disclose any information concerning any history of civil commitment.  The report shall also include a medical history of the defendant and a complete psychological evaluation of the defendant in any case in which the defendant is being sentenced for a first or second degree crime involving violence and: (1)   the defendant has a prior acquittal by reason of insanity pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-1 or had charges suspended pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-6; or (2)   the defendant has a prior conviction for murder pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-3, aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-2, kidnapping pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-1, endangering the welfare of a child which would constitute a crime of the first or second degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-4, or stalking which would constitute a crime of the third degree pursuant to P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10); or (3)   the defendant has a prior diagnosis of psychosis.

The presentence report shall also include a report on any compensation paid by the Victims of Crime Compensation Board as a result of the commission of the offense and, in any case where the victim chooses to provide one, a statement by the victim of the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.  The statement may include the nature and extent of any physical harm or psychological or emotional harm or trauma suffered by the victim, the extent of any loss to include loss of earnings or ability to work suffered by the victim and the effect of the crime upon the victim's family.  The probation department shall notify the victim or nearest relative of a homicide victim of his right to make a statement for inclusion in the presentence report if the victim or relative so desires.  Any such statement shall be made within 20 days of notification by the probation department. The presentence report shall specifically include an assessment of the gravity and seriousness of harm inflicted on the victim, including whether or not the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim of the offense was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance due to advanced age, disability, ill-health, or extreme youth, or was for any other reason substantially incapable of exercising normal physical or mental power of resistance. c.     If, after the presentence investigation, the court desires additional information concerning an offender convicted of an offense before imposing sentence, it may order any additional psychological or medical testing of the defendant. d.    Disclosure of any presentence investigation report or psychiatric examination report shall be in accordance with law and the Rules of Court, except that information concerning the defendant's financial resources shall be made available upon request to the Victims of Crime Compensation Board or to any officer authorized under the provisions of section 3 of P.L.1979, c.396 (C.2C:46-4) to collect payment on an assessment, restitution or fine and that information concerning the defendant's coverage under any health insurance contract, policy or plan shall be made available, as appropriate to the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections and to the chief administrative officer of a county jail in accordance with the provisions of P.L.1995, c.254 (C.30:7E-1 et al.). e.     The court shall not impose a sentence of imprisonment for an extended term unless the ground therefor has been established at a hearing after the conviction of the defendant and on written notice to him of the ground proposed.  The defendant shall have the right to hear and controvert the evidence against him and to offer evidence upon the issue. f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1986, c.85).

The report may include a written or videotaped statement concerning the continuing nature and extent of any physical harm or psychological or emotional harm or trauma suffered by the victim, the extent of any loss of earnings or ability to work suffered by the victim and the continuing effect of the crime upon the victim's family.  At the time public notice is given that an inmate is being considered  for  parole pursuant  to  this section, the board shall also notify any victim or nearest relative who has previously contacted the board of the availability to provide a written or videotaped statement for inclusion in the parole report or to present testimony at the parole hearing. The board shall notify such person at his last known mailing address. c.     A copy of the report filed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, excepting those documents which have been classified as confidential pursuant to rules and regulations of the board or the Department of Corrections, shall be served on the inmate at the time it is filed with the board panel.  The inmate may file with the board panel a written statement regarding the report, but shall do so within 105 days prior to the primary parole eligibility date. d.    Upon receipt of the public notice pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45), a county prosecutor may request from the parole board a copy of the report on any adult inmate prepared pursuant to subsection a. of this section, which shall be expeditiously forwarded to the county prosecutor by the parole board by mail, courier, or other means of delivery.  Upon receipt of the report, the prosecutor has 10 working days to review the report and notify the parole board of the prosecutor's comments, if any, or notify the parole board of the prosecutor's intent to provide comments.  If the county prosecutor does not provide comments or notify the parole board of the prosecutor's intent to provide comments within the 10 working days, the parole board may presume that the prosecutor does not wish to provide comments and may proceed with the parole consideration.  Any comments provided by a county prosecutor shall be delivered to the parole board by the same method by which the county prosecutor received the report.  The confidentiality of the contents in a report which are classified as confidential shall be maintained and shall not be disclosed to any person who is not authorized to receive or review a copy of the report containing the confidential information. e.     Any provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, the board shall by rule or regulation modify the scope of the required reports and time periods for rendering such reports with reference to county penal institutions. f.     Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the board may modify the time periods for submitting the reports required pursuant to this section in processing an inmate whose parole eligibility date is accelerated pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55). (cf:  P.L.2001, c.141, s.3) 12.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill revises the States laws governing child pornography. The bill modifies subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:24-4, concerning real child pornography to include: (1)   upgrading to a first degree crime for all persons, not just parents and guardians, causing or permitting a child to engage in or simulation of a prohibited sexual act knowing that the act would be photographed or reproduced; (2)   explicitly stating that an intent to distribute, advertise, offer or agree to offer is not an element of creating or reproducing child pornography and clarifying that the elements of this offense include producing, creating, copying or duplicating images of child pornography, or posting those images on the Internet; (3)   clarifying that possessing child pornography for the purpose of distributing it is a second degree crime and streamlining the definition of distribute; (4)   upgrading possession of child pornography to a crime of the third degree; and (5)   establishing a rebuttable presumption that a person appearing to be a child in a photo, video, or computer file, is in fact an actual child; (6)   requiring defendants who intend to defend a charge of child pornography by claiming that it was created without using an actual child, or the face or any of the intimate parts of an actual child, or depicts the image of a person who is not a child, to notify the prosecutor of that claim in accordance with the Rules of Court; and (7)   allowing the admissibility of hearsay evidence to be used to establish the existence, identity and age of an actual child depicted in child pornography. The bill also adds a new subsection c. to N.J.S.2C:24-4 to establish the crime of virtual child pornography, the provisions of which parallel the provisions of subsection b. concerning real child pornography.  This new subsection: (1)   makes it a crime of the second degree to use any device, including a computer, to produce, create, or reproduce an image which appears to depict a child in a obscene prohibited sexual act or in a simulation of such an act; (2)   makes it a crime of the second degree to knowingly distribute obscene virtual child pornography; (3)   makes it a crime of the third degree to knowingly possess obscene virtual child pornography; (4)   defines an obscene depiction to be one in which:  a sexual act is patently offensive; lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value when taken as a whole; and is part of a work which, taken as a whole in light of contemporary community standards, appeals to the prurient interest; and (5)   specifies that when virtual child pornography is obscene, the defendant is strictly liable; Other provisions of the bill: require defendants to be reviewed for referral to the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center if convicted of certain real and virtual child pornography crimes; prohibit expungement of criminal records; provide for notification to the prosecuting agency and victim when a defendant is placed in a community release program or released from incarceration; and require certain repeat offenders presentence and parole eligibility report to include a complete psychological evaluation for repeat offenders. The bill also eliminates the presumption of nonincarceration, normally applicable to third degree crimes, for the crime of possessing real or virtual child pornography. The bill includes a fixed mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for certain recidivists who violate N.J.S.2C:24-4.  Defendants convicted of engaging in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of a child in violation of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:24‑4 or of child pornography crimes under subsection b. or c. of N.J.S.2C:24-4 must be sentenced to prison and serve one‑third to one-half of their sentences before being eligible for parole if they have previously been convicted of other sex crimes including luring or enticing a child, sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, or child endangerment.  The bill also makes a prior conviction under N.J.S.2C:24-4 the basis for a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-6, and provides that the minimum term must be imposed regardless of whether the defendant is sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment. Finally, the bill amends various other statutes to ensure that virtual child pornographers are subject to the same penalties as real child pornographers.  Thus, wherever a statute specifically refers to a provision of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:24-4, this bill adds subsection c. to the statute.
