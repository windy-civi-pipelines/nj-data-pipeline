S2110 SENATE, No. 2110 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  HOLLY T. SCHEPISI District 39 (Bergen) SYNOPSIS Limits amount of real property that may be exempt from property taxation under Long Term Tax Exemption Law. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act limiting the amount of real property that may be exempt from property taxation under the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, and amending P.L.1991, c.431. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    The Legislature finds that in the past a number of laws have been enacted to provide for the clearance, replanning, development, and redevelopment of blighted areas pursuant to Article VIII, Section III, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution.  These laws had as their public purpose the restoration of deteriorated or neglected properties to a use resulting in the elimination of the blighted condition, and sought to encourage private capital and participation by private enterprise to contribute toward this purpose through the use of special financial arrangements, including the granting of property tax exemptions with respect to land and the buildings, structures, infrastructure and other valuable additions to and amelioration of land, provided that the construction or rehabilitation of buildings, structures, infrastructure and other valuable additions to and amelioration of land constitute improvements to blighted conditions. The Legislature finds that these laws, separately enacted, contain redundant and unnecessary provisions, or provisions which have outlived their usefulness, and that it is necessary to revise, consolidate and clarify the law in this area in order to preserve and improve the usefulness of the law in promoting the original public purpose. The Legislature declares that the provisions of this act are one means of accomplishing the redevelopment and rehabilitation purposes of the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.) through the use of private entities and financial arrangements pertaining thereto, and that this act should be construed in conjunction with that act. The Legislature also finds that the unrestrained use of long term property tax exemptions by a municipality may place an unreasonable burden on the State when it results in understating a substantial amount of that municipalitys property wealth, which is used to calculate State school aid.  The effect of understating a municipalitys property wealth potentially increases the allocation of State school aid to that municipalitys school district, at the expense of all other school districts.  This subsidization of a portion of the school tax burden, that otherwise would be paid by the exempted properties, by other school districts that had no role in granting the tax exemption is unfair as a form of taxation without representation. (cf:  P.L.2003, c.125, s.6) 2.    Section 4 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-4) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a.  [The] Except as provided in subsection b. of this section the governing body of a municipality which has adopted a redevelopment plan pursuant to the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-11 et al.) may enter into a financial agreement with an urban renewal entity for the undertaking of a project set forth in a redevelopment plan adopted by the governing body pursuant to the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.) or a project necessary, useful, or convenient for the relocation of residents displaced or to be displaced by the redevelopment of all or any part of one or more redevelopment areas, or a low and moderate income housing project.  The financial agreement shall include, but not be limited to, those provisions set forth in sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-8 through 40A:20-11), and shall be subject to review and approval as required by section 8 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-8) prior to execution.   The municipality which enters into the agreement shall retain all necessary authority and control for the redevelopment of the redevelopment area set forth in the plan, and the undertaking of a project by an urban renewal entity pursuant to that plan and P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) shall be deemed a delegation of the powers of the municipality to undertake the project, which delegation shall be limited by the terms of the agreement and the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.). An urban renewal entity pursuant to an agreement may undertake a project, and when so authorized by the financial agreement, acquire by purchase or lease for not less than the term of the tax exemption, plan, develop, construct, alter, maintain or operate housing, senior citizen housing, business, industrial, commercial, administrative, community, health, recreational, educational, cultural, or welfare projects, or any combination of two or more of these types of improvement in a single project .   The conditions of use, ownership, management and control of the improvements in a project shall be regulated by this act and the terms of the financial agreement. b.    The governing body of a municipality in which the long term tax exemption threshold is greater than five percent shall not enter into any further financial agreements while that threshold remains above five percent.  The long term tax exemption threshold shall be calculated by dividing the value of property already subject to a financial agreement, pursuant to this section, by the sum of the value of property already subject to a financial agreement pursuant to this section plus the net valuation taxable, and multiplying that quotient by 100. If a tax exemption under the Long Term Tax Exemption is denied because the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold is greater than five percent, but in a later year, the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold becomes lower than five percent, the municipality may at its sole discretion permit the tax exemption upon reapplication to the extent that the tax exemption does not increase the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold past the five percent limit established in this subsection. (cf:  P.L.1992, c.79, s.55) 3.    Section 12 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-12) is amended to read as follows: 12.  The rehabilitation or improvements made in the development or redevelopment of a redevelopment area or area appurtenant thereto or for a redevelopment relocation housing project, pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), shall be exempt from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided, except that the rehabilitation or improvements made in a redevelopment area located in a municipality that exceeds the threshold for exempted property, as calculated pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-4), shall not be exempt from taxation. When housing is to be constructed, acquired or rehabilitated by an urban renewal entity, the land upon which that housing is situated shall be exempt from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided.  The exemption shall be allowed when the clerk of the municipality wherein the property is situated shall certify to the municipal tax assessor that a financial agreement with an urban renewal entity for the development or the redevelopment of the property, or the provision of a redevelopment relocation housing project, or the provision of a low and moderate income housing project has been entered into and is in effect as required by P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.). Delivery by the municipal clerk to the municipal tax assessor of a certified copy of the ordinance of the governing body approving the tax exemption and financial agreement with the urban renewal entity shall constitute the required certification.  For each exemption granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.), upon certification as required hereunder, the tax assessor shall implement the exemption and continue to enforce that exemption without further certification by the clerk until the expiration of the entitlement to exemption by the terms of the financial agreement or until the tax assessor has been duly notified by the clerk that the exemption has been terminated. Within 10 calendar days following the later of the effective date of an ordinance following its final adoption by the governing body approving the tax exemption or the execution of the financial agreement by the urban renewal entity, the municipal clerk shall transmit a certified copy of the ordinance and financial agreement to the chief financial officer of the county and to the county counsel for informational purposes. Whenever an exemption status changes during a tax year, the procedure for the apportionment of the taxes for the year shall be the same as in the case of other changes in tax exemption status during the tax year.  Tax exemptions granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) represent long term financial agreements between the municipality and the urban renewal entity and as such constitute a single continuing exemption from local property taxation for the duration of the financial agreement.  The validity of a financial agreement or any exemption granted pursuant thereto may be challenged only by filing an action in lieu of prerogative writ within 20 days from the publication of a notice of the adoption of an ordinance by the governing body granting the exemption and approving the financial agreement.  Such notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and in a newspaper of general circulation in the county if different from the municipal newspaper. a.     The financial agreement shall specify the duration of the exemption for urban renewal entities in accordance with the parameters of either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this subsection: (1)   the financial agreement may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of the entire project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement between the municipality and the urban renewal entity; or (2)   for each project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially, the financial agreement may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of a project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  As used in this subsection, "redevelopment agreement" means an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection f. of section 8 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-8) between a municipality or redevelopment entity and a redeveloper. A financial agreement may provide for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of the entire project, less than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement, or less than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring a financial agreement for a project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially to specify a duration within the parameters of paragraph (2) of this subsection. b.    During the term of any exemption, in lieu of any taxes to be paid on the buildings and improvements of the project and, to the extent authorized pursuant to this section, on the land, the urban renewal entity shall make payment to the municipality of an annual service charge, which shall remit a portion of that revenue to the county as provided hereinafter.  In addition, the municipality may assess an administrative fee, not to exceed two percent of the annual service charge, for the processing of the application.  The annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project to be paid by the urban renewal entity for any period of exemption, shall be determined as follows: (1)   An annual amount equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the annual gross revenue from each unit of the project, if the project is undertaken in units, or from the total project, if the project is not undertaken in units.  The percentage of the annual gross revenue shall not be more than [15%] 15 percent in the case of a low and moderate income housing project, nor less than [10%] 10 percent in the case of all other projects. At the option of the municipality, or where because of the nature of the development, ownership, use or occupancy of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is to be undertaken in units, the total annual gross rental or gross shelter rent or annual gross revenue cannot be reasonably ascertained, the governing body shall provide in the financial agreement that the annual service charge shall be a sum equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the total project cost or total project unit cost determined pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) calculated from the first day of the month following the substantial completion of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is undertaken in units.  The percentage of the total project cost or total project unit cost shall not be more than [2%] two percent in the case of a low and moderate income housing project, and shall not be less than [2%] two percent in the case of all other projects. (2)   In either case, the financial agreement shall establish a schedule of annual service charges to be paid over the term of the exemption period, which shall be in stages as follows: (a)   For the first stage of the exemption period, which shall commence with the date of completion of the unit or of the project, as the case may be, and continue for a time of not less than six years nor more than 15 years, as specified in the financial agreement, the urban renewal entity shall pay the municipality an annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project in an annual amount equal to the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11).  For the remainder of the period of the exemption, if any, the annual service charge shall be determined as follows: (b)   For the second stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or [20%] 20 percent of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; (c)   For the third stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or [40%] 40 percent of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; (d)   For the fourth stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or [60%] 60 percent of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; and (e)   For the final stage of the exemption period, the duration of which shall not be less than one year and shall be specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or [80%] 80 percent of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater. If the financial agreement provides for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of the entire project,  less than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement, or less than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement, the financial agreement shall set forth a schedule of annual service charges for the exemption period which shall be based upon the minimum service charges and staged adjustments set forth in this section. The annual service charge shall be paid to the municipality on a quarterly basis in a manner consistent with the municipality's tax collection schedule. Each municipality which enters into a financial agreement on or after the effective date of P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) shall remit [5] five percent of the annual service charge collected by the municipality to the county in accordance with the provisions of R.S.54:4-74. Against the annual service charge the urban renewal entity shall be entitled to credit for the amount, without interest, of the real estate taxes on land paid by it in the last four preceding quarterly installments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of the financial agreement, the minimum annual service charge shall be the amount of the total taxes levied against all real property in the area covered by the project in the last full tax year in which the area was subject to taxation, and the minimum annual service charge shall be paid in each year in which the annual service charge calculated pursuant to this section or the financial agreement would be less than the minimum annual service charge. c.     All exemptions granted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) shall terminate at the time prescribed in the financial agreement. Upon the termination of the exemption granted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), the project, all affected parcels, land and all improvements made thereto shall be assessed and subject to taxation as are other taxable properties in the municipality.  After the date of termination, all restrictions and limitations upon the urban renewal entity shall terminate and be at an end upon the entity's rendering its final accounting to and with the municipality. (cf:  P.L.2018, c.97, s.17) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would limit the amount of real property that can be property tax exempt under the Long Term Tax Exemption Law. The bill would require that the governing body of a municipality in which the long term tax exemption threshold is greater than five percent of the sum of the municipalitys net valuation taxable and the value of properties already exempted under the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, shall not enter into any further financial agreements while that threshold remains above five percent.  The long term tax exemption threshold is calculated by dividing the value of property already subject to a financial agreement, by the sum of the value of property already subject to a financial agreement plus the net valuation taxable, and that quotient multiplied by 100. If a tax exemption under the Long Term Tax Exemption is denied because the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold is greater than five percent, but in a later year, the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold becomes lower than five percent, the municipality may at its sole discretion permit the tax exemption upon reapplication to the extent that the tax exemption does not increase the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold past the five percent limit.

S2110 SENATE, No. 2110 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  HOLLY T.

Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    The Legislature finds that in the past a number of laws have been enacted to provide for the clearance, replanning, development, and redevelopment of blighted areas pursuant to Article VIII, Section III, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution.  These laws had as their public purpose the restoration of deteriorated or neglected properties to a use resulting in the elimination of the blighted condition, and sought to encourage private capital and participation by private enterprise to contribute toward this purpose through the use of special financial arrangements, including the granting of property tax exemptions with respect to land and the buildings, structures, infrastructure and other valuable additions to and amelioration of land, provided that the construction or rehabilitation of buildings, structures, infrastructure and other valuable additions to and amelioration of land constitute improvements to blighted conditions.

(cf:  P.L.2003, c.125, s.6) 2.    Section 4 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-4) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a.  [The] Except as provided in subsection b. of this section the governing body of a municipality which has adopted a redevelopment plan pursuant to the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-11 et al.) may enter into a financial agreement with an urban renewal entity for the undertaking of a project set forth in a redevelopment plan adopted by the governing body pursuant to the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.) or a project necessary, useful, or convenient for the relocation of residents displaced or to be displaced by the redevelopment of all or any part of one or more redevelopment areas, or a low and moderate income housing project.  The financial agreement shall include, but not be limited to, those provisions set forth in sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-8 through 40A:20-11), and shall be subject to review and approval as required by section 8 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-8) prior to execution.   The municipality which enters into the agreement shall retain all necessary authority and control for the redevelopment of the redevelopment area set forth in the plan, and the undertaking of a project by an urban renewal entity pursuant to that plan and P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) shall be deemed a delegation of the powers of the municipality to undertake the project, which delegation shall be limited by the terms of the agreement and the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.). An urban renewal entity pursuant to an agreement may undertake a project, and when so authorized by the financial agreement, acquire by purchase or lease for not less than the term of the tax exemption, plan, develop, construct, alter, maintain or operate housing, senior citizen housing, business, industrial, commercial, administrative, community, health, recreational, educational, cultural, or welfare projects, or any combination of two or more of these types of improvement in a single project .   The conditions of use, ownership, management and control of the improvements in a project shall be regulated by this act and the terms of the financial agreement. b.    The governing body of a municipality in which the long term tax exemption threshold is greater than five percent shall not enter into any further financial agreements while that threshold remains above five percent.  The long term tax exemption threshold shall be calculated by dividing the value of property already subject to a financial agreement, pursuant to this section, by the sum of the value of property already subject to a financial agreement pursuant to this section plus the net valuation taxable, and multiplying that quotient by 100. If a tax exemption under the Long Term Tax Exemption is denied because the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold is greater than five percent, but in a later year, the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold becomes lower than five percent, the municipality may at its sole discretion permit the tax exemption upon reapplication to the extent that the tax exemption does not increase the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold past the five percent limit established in this subsection. (cf:  P.L.1992, c.79, s.55) 3.    Section 12 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-12) is amended to read as follows: 12.  The rehabilitation or improvements made in the development or redevelopment of a redevelopment area or area appurtenant thereto or for a redevelopment relocation housing project, pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), shall be exempt from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided, except that the rehabilitation or improvements made in a redevelopment area located in a municipality that exceeds the threshold for exempted property, as calculated pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-4), shall not be exempt from taxation. When housing is to be constructed, acquired or rehabilitated by an urban renewal entity, the land upon which that housing is situated shall be exempt from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided.  The exemption shall be allowed when the clerk of the municipality wherein the property is situated shall certify to the municipal tax assessor that a financial agreement with an urban renewal entity for the development or the redevelopment of the property, or the provision of a redevelopment relocation housing project, or the provision of a low and moderate income housing project has been entered into and is in effect as required by P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.). Delivery by the municipal clerk to the municipal tax assessor of a certified copy of the ordinance of the governing body approving the tax exemption and financial agreement with the urban renewal entity shall constitute the required certification.  For each exemption granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.), upon certification as required hereunder, the tax assessor shall implement the exemption and continue to enforce that exemption without further certification by the clerk until the expiration of the entitlement to exemption by the terms of the financial agreement or until the tax assessor has been duly notified by the clerk that the exemption has been terminated. Within 10 calendar days following the later of the effective date of an ordinance following its final adoption by the governing body approving the tax exemption or the execution of the financial agreement by the urban renewal entity, the municipal clerk shall transmit a certified copy of the ordinance and financial agreement to the chief financial officer of the county and to the county counsel for informational purposes. Whenever an exemption status changes during a tax year, the procedure for the apportionment of the taxes for the year shall be the same as in the case of other changes in tax exemption status during the tax year.  Tax exemptions granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) represent long term financial agreements between the municipality and the urban renewal entity and as such constitute a single continuing exemption from local property taxation for the duration of the financial agreement.  The validity of a financial agreement or any exemption granted pursuant thereto may be challenged only by filing an action in lieu of prerogative writ within 20 days from the publication of a notice of the adoption of an ordinance by the governing body granting the exemption and approving the financial agreement.  Such notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and in a newspaper of general circulation in the county if different from the municipal newspaper. a.     The financial agreement shall specify the duration of the exemption for urban renewal entities in accordance with the parameters of either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this subsection: (1)   the financial agreement may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of the entire project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement between the municipality and the urban renewal entity; or (2)   for each project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially, the financial agreement may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of a project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  As used in this subsection, "redevelopment agreement" means an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection f. of section 8 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-8) between a municipality or redevelopment entity and a redeveloper. A financial agreement may provide for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of the entire project, less than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement, or less than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring a financial agreement for a project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially to specify a duration within the parameters of paragraph (2) of this subsection. b.    During the term of any exemption, in lieu of any taxes to be paid on the buildings and improvements of the project and, to the extent authorized pursuant to this section, on the land, the urban renewal entity shall make payment to the municipality of an annual service charge, which shall remit a portion of that revenue to the county as provided hereinafter.  In addition, the municipality may assess an administrative fee, not to exceed two percent of the annual service charge, for the processing of the application.  The annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project to be paid by the urban renewal entity for any period of exemption, shall be determined as follows: (1)   An annual amount equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the annual gross revenue from each unit of the project, if the project is undertaken in units, or from the total project, if the project is not undertaken in units.  The percentage of the annual gross revenue shall not be more than [15%] 15 percent in the case of a low and moderate income housing project, nor less than [10%] 10 percent in the case of all other projects. At the option of the municipality, or where because of the nature of the development, ownership, use or occupancy of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is to be undertaken in units, the total annual gross rental or gross shelter rent or annual gross revenue cannot be reasonably ascertained, the governing body shall provide in the financial agreement that the annual service charge shall be a sum equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the total project cost or total project unit cost determined pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) calculated from the first day of the month following the substantial completion of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is undertaken in units.  The percentage of the total project cost or total project unit cost shall not be more than [2%] two percent in the case of a low and moderate income housing project, and shall not be less than [2%] two percent in the case of all other projects. (2)   In either case, the financial agreement shall establish a schedule of annual service charges to be paid over the term of the exemption period, which shall be in stages as follows: (a)   For the first stage of the exemption period, which shall commence with the date of completion of the unit or of the project, as the case may be, and continue for a time of not less than six years nor more than 15 years, as specified in the financial agreement, the urban renewal entity shall pay the municipality an annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project in an annual amount equal to the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11).  For the remainder of the period of the exemption, if any, the annual service charge shall be determined as follows: (b)   For the second stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or [20%] 20 percent of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; (c)   For the third stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or [40%] 40 percent of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; (d)   For the fourth stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or [60%] 60 percent of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; and (e)   For the final stage of the exemption period, the duration of which shall not be less than one year and shall be specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or [80%] 80 percent of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater. If the financial agreement provides for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of the entire project,  less than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement, or less than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement, the financial agreement shall set forth a schedule of annual service charges for the exemption period which shall be based upon the minimum service charges and staged adjustments set forth in this section. The annual service charge shall be paid to the municipality on a quarterly basis in a manner consistent with the municipality's tax collection schedule. Each municipality which enters into a financial agreement on or after the effective date of P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) shall remit [5] five percent of the annual service charge collected by the municipality to the county in accordance with the provisions of R.S.54:4-74. Against the annual service charge the urban renewal entity shall be entitled to credit for the amount, without interest, of the real estate taxes on land paid by it in the last four preceding quarterly installments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of the financial agreement, the minimum annual service charge shall be the amount of the total taxes levied against all real property in the area covered by the project in the last full tax year in which the area was subject to taxation, and the minimum annual service charge shall be paid in each year in which the annual service charge calculated pursuant to this section or the financial agreement would be less than the minimum annual service charge. c.     All exemptions granted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) shall terminate at the time prescribed in the financial agreement. Upon the termination of the exemption granted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), the project, all affected parcels, land and all improvements made thereto shall be assessed and subject to taxation as are other taxable properties in the municipality.  After the date of termination, all restrictions and limitations upon the urban renewal entity shall terminate and be at an end upon the entity's rendering its final accounting to and with the municipality. (cf:  P.L.2018, c.97, s.17) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would limit the amount of real property that can be property tax exempt under the Long Term Tax Exemption Law. The bill would require that the governing body of a municipality in which the long term tax exemption threshold is greater than five percent of the sum of the municipalitys net valuation taxable and the value of properties already exempted under the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, shall not enter into any further financial agreements while that threshold remains above five percent.  The long term tax exemption threshold is calculated by dividing the value of property already subject to a financial agreement, by the sum of the value of property already subject to a financial agreement plus the net valuation taxable, and that quotient multiplied by 100. If a tax exemption under the Long Term Tax Exemption is denied because the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold is greater than five percent, but in a later year, the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold becomes lower than five percent, the municipality may at its sole discretion permit the tax exemption upon reapplication to the extent that the tax exemption does not increase the municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold past the five percent limit.
