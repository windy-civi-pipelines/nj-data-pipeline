<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1991,
c.431 (C.40A:20-2) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
that in the past a number of laws have been enacted to provide for the
clearance, replanning, development, and redevelopment of blighted areas
pursuant to Article VIII, Section III, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey
Constitution.  These laws had as their public purpose the restoration of
deteriorated or neglected properties to a use resulting in the elimination of
the blighted condition, and sought to encourage private capital and
participation by private enterprise to contribute toward this purpose through
the use of special financial arrangements, including the granting of property
tax exemptions with respect to land and the buildings, structures,
infrastructure and other valuable additions to and amelioration of land,
provided that the construction or rehabilitation of buildings, structures,
infrastructure and other valuable additions to and amelioration of land
constitute improvements to blighted conditions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature finds that
these laws, separately enacted, contain redundant and unnecessary provisions,
or provisions which have outlived their usefulness, and that it is necessary to
revise, consolidate and clarify the law in this area in order to preserve and
improve the usefulness of the law in promoting the original public purpose.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature declares that
the provisions of this act are one means of accomplishing the redevelopment and
rehabilitation purposes of the &quot;Local Redevelopment and Housing Law,&quot;
P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.) through the use of private entities and
financial arrangements pertaining thereto, and that this act should be
construed in conjunction with that act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The Legislature also finds
that the unrestrained use of long term property tax exemptions by a
municipality may place an unreasonable burden on the State when it results in
understating a substantial amount of that municipalitys property wealth, which
is used to calculate State school aid.  The effect of understating a
municipalitys property wealth potentially increases the allocation of State
school aid to that municipalitys school district, at the expense of all other
school districts.  This subsidization of a portion of the school tax burden,
that otherwise would be paid by the exempted properties, by other school
districts that had no role in granting the tax exemption is unfair as a form of
taxation without representation.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf:  P.L.2003, c.125, s.6)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 4 of P.L.1991,
c.431 (C.40A:20-4) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    <u>a.</u>  <b><span

style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>Except as
provided in subsection b. of this section the</u> governing body of a
municipality which has adopted a redevelopment plan pursuant to the &quot;Local
Redevelopment and Housing Law,&quot; P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-11 et al.) may
enter into a financial agreement with an urban renewal entity for the undertaking
of a project set forth in a redevelopment plan adopted by the governing body
pursuant to the &quot;Local Redevelopment and Housing Law,&quot; P.L.1992, c.79
(C.40A:12A-1 et al.) or a project necessary, useful, or convenient for the
relocation of residents displaced or to be displaced by the redevelopment of
all or any part of one or more redevelopment areas, or a low and moderate
income housing project.  The financial agreement shall include, but not be
limited to, those provisions set forth in sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 of P.L.1991,
c.431 (C.40A:20-8 through 40A:20-11), and shall be subject to review and
approval as required by section 8 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-8) prior to
execution.   The municipality which enters into the agreement shall retain all
necessary authority and control for the redevelopment of the redevelopment area
set forth in the plan, and the undertaking of a project by an urban renewal
entity pursuant to that plan and P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) shall be
deemed a delegation of the powers of the municipality to undertake the project,
which delegation shall be limited by the terms of the agreement and the
provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.).  </p>

housing, senior citizen housing, business, industrial, commercial,
administrative, community, health, recreational, educational, cultural, or
welfare projects, or any combination of two or more of these types of
improvement in a single project .   The conditions of use, ownership,
management and control of the improvements in a project shall be regulated by
this act and the terms of the financial agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>b.    The governing body of
a municipality in which the long term tax exemption threshold is greater than
five percent shall not enter into any further financial agreements while that
threshold remains above five percent.  The long term tax exemption threshold
shall be calculated by dividing the value of property already subject to a
financial agreement, pursuant to this section, by the sum of the value of
property already subject to a financial agreement pursuant to this section plus
the net valuation taxable, and multiplying that quotient by 100.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>If a tax exemption under
the Long Term Tax Exemption is denied because the municipalitys long term tax
exemption threshold is greater than five percent, but in a later year, the
municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold becomes lower than five
percent, the municipality may at its sole discretion permit the tax exemption
upon reapplication to the extent that the tax exemption does not increase the
municipalitys long term tax exemption threshold past the five percent limit

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Section 12 of P.L.1991,
c.431 (C.40A:20-12) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  The rehabilitation or improvements
made in the development or redevelopment of a redevelopment area or area
appurtenant thereto or for a redevelopment relocation housing project, pursuant
to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), shall be exempt from taxation for a
limited period as hereinafter provided<u>, except that the rehabilitation or
improvements made in a redevelopment area located in a municipality that exceeds
the threshold for exempted property, as calculated pursuant to subsection b. of
section 4 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-4), shall not be exempt from taxation</u>. 
When housing is to be constructed, acquired or rehabilitated by an urban
renewal entity, the land upon which that housing is situated shall be exempt
from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided.  The exemption
shall be allowed when the clerk of the municipality wherein the property is
situated shall certify to the municipal tax assessor that a financial agreement
with an urban renewal entity for the development or the redevelopment of the
property, or the provision of a redevelopment relocation housing project, or
the provision of a low and moderate income housing project has been entered
into and is in effect as required by P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Delivery by the municipal
clerk to the municipal tax assessor of a certified copy of the ordinance of the
governing body approving the tax exemption and financial agreement with the
urban renewal entity shall constitute the required certification.  For each
exemption granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.), upon
certification as required hereunder, the tax assessor shall implement the
exemption and continue to enforce that exemption without further certification
by the clerk until the expiration of the entitlement to exemption by the terms
of the financial agreement or until the tax assessor has been duly notified by
the clerk that the exemption has been terminated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 10 calendar days
following the later of the effective date of an ordinance following its final
adoption by the governing body approving the tax exemption or the execution of
the financial agreement by the urban renewal entity, the municipal clerk shall
transmit a certified copy of the ordinance and financial agreement to the chief
financial officer of the county and to the county counsel for informational
purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever an exemption status
changes during a tax year, the procedure for the apportionment of the taxes for
the year shall be the same as in the case of other changes in tax exemption
status during the tax year.  Tax exemptions granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125
(C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) represent long term financial agreements between the
municipality and the urban renewal entity and as such constitute a single
continuing exemption from local property taxation for the duration of the
financial agreement.  The validity of a financial agreement or any exemption
granted pursuant thereto may be challenged only by filing an action in lieu of
prerogative writ within 20 days from the publication of a notice of the
adoption of an ordinance by the governing body granting the exemption and
approving the financial agreement.  Such notice shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and in a newspaper of
general circulation in the county if different from the municipal newspaper.</p>

accordance with the parameters of either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this
subsection: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the financial agreement
may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of the
entire project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units,
or not more than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement between
the municipality and the urban renewal entity; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   for each project
undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper
to undertake two or more projects sequentially, the financial agreement may
specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of a project,
or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than
50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a
project under the redevelopment agreement.  As used in this subsection,
&quot;redevelopment agreement&quot; means an agreement entered into pursuant to
subsection f. of section 8 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-8) between a
municipality or redevelopment entity and a redeveloper. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A financial agreement may
provide for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of
the entire project, less than 35 years from the execution of the financial

agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  Nothing in
this subsection shall be construed as requiring a financial agreement for a
project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the
redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially to specify a
duration within the parameters of paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

service charge, which shall remit a portion of that revenue to the county as
provided hereinafter.  In addition, the municipality may assess an
administrative fee, not to exceed two percent of the annual service charge, for
the processing of the application.  The annual service charge for municipal
services supplied to the project to be paid by the urban renewal entity for any
period of exemption, shall be determined as follows:</p>

the project, if the project is undertaken in units, or from the total project,
if the project is not undertaken in units.  The percentage of the annual gross

provide in the financial agreement that the annual service charge shall be a
sum equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11
of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the total project cost or total project
unit cost determined pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.)
calculated from the first day of the month following the substantial completion
of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is undertaken in units.  The
