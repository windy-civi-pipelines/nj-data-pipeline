<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     As of 2023, 338,012
veterans live in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Repeated and extended
deployments in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have made it especially
difficult for military personnel serving since September 11, 2001 to find
housing suited to their unique situations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Veterans have served
our country in times of war and peace, sharing a common belief in a cause
higher than self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Veterans are valuable
members of communities across New Jersey, and their experience serving their
country has endowed them with unique and valuable experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The State and the
nation owe much to those who have chosen to serve in the Armed Forces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     It is essential to the
public good to encourage the development of stable, decent housing for New
Jersey's veterans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  (New section) For a bidder
who is a veteran, a sheriff shall not require a deposit of more than five
percent immediately upon the conclusion of the foreclosure sale for a residential
property which the veteran bidder commits to occupy for a minimum of two years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  Section 3 of P.L.1995,
c.244 (C.2A:50-55) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Deed in lieu of
foreclosure&quot; means a voluntary, knowing and uncoerced conveyance by the
residential mortgage debtor to the residential mortgage lender of all claim,
interest and estate in the property subject to the mortgage.  In order for a
conveyance to be voluntary, the debtor shall have received notice of, and been fully
apprised of the debtor's rights as specified in section 4 of this act.  For
purposes of this act, &quot;voluntarily surrendered&quot; has the same meaning
as &quot;deed in lieu of foreclosure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Immediate family&quot;
means the debtor, the debtor's spouse, or the mother, father, sister, brother
or child of the debtor or debtor's spouse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Non-residential
mortgage&quot; means a mortgage, security interest or the like which is not a
residential mortgage.  If a mortgage document includes separate tracts or
properties, those portions of the mortgage document covering the
non-residential tracts or properties shall be a non-residential mortgage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Obligation&quot; means a
promissory note, bond or other similar evidence of a duty to pay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Office&quot; means the
Office of Foreclosure within the Administrative Office of the Courts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Residential
mortgage&quot; means a mortgage, security interest or the like, in which the
security is a residential property such as a house, real property or
condominium, which is occupied, or is to be occupied, by the debtor, who is a
natural person, or a member of the debtor's immediate family, as that person's
residence.  This act shall apply to all residential mortgages wherever made,
which have as their security such a residence in the State of New Jersey,
provided that the real property which is the subject of the mortgage shall not
have more than four dwelling units, one of which shall be, or is planned to be,
occupied by the debtor or a member of the debtor's immediate family as the
debtor's or member's residence at the time the loan is originated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Residential mortgage
debtor&quot; or &quot;debtor&quot; means any person shown on the record of the
residential mortgage lender as being obligated to pay the obligation secured by
the residential mortgage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Residential mortgage
lender&quot; or &quot;lender&quot; means any person, corporation, or other

sale of a mortgaged premises under foreclosure action, each sheriff in this
State shall provide for, but not be limited to, the following uniform procedures:</p>

that the sheriff cannot comply with the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this
paragraph (3), the foreclosing plaintiff may apply to the office for an order
appointing a Special Master to hold the foreclosure sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Upon the foreclosing
plaintiff making such application to the office, the office shall issue the
appropriate order appointing a Special Master to hold the foreclosure sale. The
office may issue the order to appoint a Special Master to hold foreclosure
sales for one or more properties within a vicinage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   That notice for the sale
of a foreclosed upon residential property be mailed to the primary address of
the foreclosed upon defendant and to the address of the foreclosed upon
residential property.  Notice of the sale shall be mailed in an envelope that
plainly states on its exterior that the envelope is a notice for the sale of
the foreclosed upon residential property. The language used on the exterior of
the envelope shall comply with the federal &quot;Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act,&quot; 15 U.S.C. s.1692 et seq.</p>

upset price for the sale of a foreclosed upon residential property be provided
at least four weeks prior to the sheriff's sale and posted on the Internet
website of the sheriff's office and on any other medium used to provide notice
of the sheriff's sale.  The upset price provided in the notice shall be a good
faith estimate of the upset price on the day of the sheriff's sale; however,
the upset price on the day of the sheriff's sale shall not increase by more
than three percent from the upset price originally provided in the notice.  If
the sheriff's sale is delayed or postponed, or if circumstances occur that
require unforeseen advances to protect the borrower or the foreclosed upon
residential property in the event of vandalism, weather damage, or other
emergency property preservation needs, the upset price may be adjusted to
reflect these costs in the latest price; and</p>

of the foreclosed upon defendant, or a nonprofit community development
corporation to inquire whether the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin, or
nonprofit community development corporation intends to participate in the sheriff's
sale for the foreclosed upon property or exercise the provisions of P.L.2023,
c.255 (C.2A:50-56a et al.). If, after providing notice of the upset price

community development corporation intends to participate in the sheriff's sale
or exercise the provisions of P.L.2023, c.255 (C.2A:50-56a et al.), the
foreclosing plaintiff shall not attempt to delay or postpone the sheriff's sale
by reason of the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin, or nonprofit community
development corporation's intention to participate in the sheriff's sale or
exercise the provisions of P.L.2023, c.255 (C.2A:50-56a et al.).  Any notice required
pursuant to this paragraph shall comply with the federal &quot;Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act,&quot; 15 U.S.C. s.1692 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Prior to the sale of
residential property, the foreclosing plaintiff shall disclose, if known,
whether the property is vacant, tenant-occupied, or owner-occupied.  If the
property is vacant, the foreclosing plaintiff shall provide the successful
bidder access to the property if the foreclosing plaintiff has such access and
may condition access by the successful bidder on being accompanied by a
representative of the foreclosing plaintiff.</p>

the successful bidder at the sheriff's sale shall pay a 20 percent deposit in
either cash or by a certified or cashier's check, made payable to the sheriff
of the county in which the sale is conducted, immediately upon the conclusion
of the foreclosure sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   In the case of
residential property in which the successful bidder is the foreclosed upon
defendant, next of kin, tenant, nonprofit community development corporation, or
a bidder who shall occupy the property as the bidder's primary residence for a
period of at least 84 months, the successful bidder who has fulfilled the
requirements set forth in subsection e. of this section shall pay a 3.5 percent
deposit of the original upset price listed in the notice provided by the
foreclosing plaintiff pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (5) of this
subsection, or the final starting upset price listed for the sale of the
property, whichever is less, with the rest of the balance due within 90
business days by cash, certified or cashier's check, or by wire transfer, made
payable to the sheriff of the county in which the sale is conducted or to the
Special Master, if the sheriff cannot comply with the provisions of
subparagraph (a) of paragraph (3) of this subsection, immediately upon the
conclusion of the foreclosure sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   If the successful bidder
cannot satisfy the requirement of this paragraph that is applicable to the
bidder, or the applicable requirement of this paragraph respectively, the
bidder shall be in default and the sheriff shall immediately void the sale and
proceed further with the resale of the premises without the necessity of
adjourning the sale, without renotification of any party to the foreclosure and
without the republication of any sales notice.  Upon such resale, the
defaulting bidder shall be liable to the foreclosing plaintiff for any
additional costs incurred by such default including, but not limited to, any
difference between the amount bid by the defaulting bidder and the amount
generated for the foreclosing plaintiff at the resale.  In the event the
plaintiff is the successful bidder at the resale, the plaintiff shall provide a
credit for the fair market value of the property foreclosed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8) It is permissible, upon
consent of the sheriff conducting the sheriff's sale, that it shall not be necessary
for an attorney or representative of the person who initiated the foreclosure
to be present physically at the sheriff's sale to make a bid.  A letter
containing bidding instructions may be sent to the sheriff in lieu of an
appearance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9) That each sheriff's office
