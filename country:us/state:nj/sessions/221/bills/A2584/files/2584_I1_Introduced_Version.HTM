The provisions of the bill are not to prohibit the operator from offering consumer discounts, loyalty programs, or other incentives for the sale of the consumers personally identifiable information, or to provide different services to consumers that are reasonably related to the value of the relevant data, provided the operator has clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer that the offered incentives require consenting to the sale or processing of personally identifiable information that the consumer otherwise has a right to opt out of. The provisions of the bill are not to apply to certain types of information and institutions listed in the bill. Nothing in the bill is to require an operator to re-identify de-identified data or to collect, retain, use, link, or combine personally identifiable information concerning a consumer that it otherwise would not.

The method by which a consumer may opt in is required to be in a form and manner determined by the operator, provided that a consumer is not to be required to establish an account with the operator in order to opt into the sale of a consumers personally identifiable information. An operator is prohibited from discriminating against a consumer if the consumer chooses to opt out of the sale of the consumers personally identifiable information. The provisions of the bill are not to prohibit the operator from offering consumer discounts, loyalty programs, or other incentives for the sale of the consumers personally identifiable information, or to provide different services to consumers that are reasonably related to the value of the relevant data, provided the operator has clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer that the offered incentives require consenting to the sale or processing of personally identifiable information that the consumer otherwise has a right to opt out of. The provisions of the bill are not to apply to certain types of information and institutions listed in the bill. Nothing in the bill is to require an operator to re-identify de-identified data or to collect, retain, use, link, or combine personally identifiable information concerning a consumer that it otherwise would not. Additionally, nothing in this bill is to be construed as the basis for, or subject to, a private right of action. The Attorney General is to have sole authority to enforce a violation of the bill.
