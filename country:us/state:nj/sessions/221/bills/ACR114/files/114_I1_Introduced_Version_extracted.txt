ACR114 ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION No. 114 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 12, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  CAROL A. MURPHY District 7 (Burlington) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblyman Sampson, Assemblywoman Speight and Assemblyman Inganamort SYNOPSIS Urges DEP and EDA to establish plastics recycling marketplace. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Concurrent Resolution urging the Department of Environmental Protection and the Economic Development Authority to establish a plastics recycling marketplace. Whereas, Single-use plastics are defined as plastic packaging and other consumer products made out of plastic that are designed to be used once and thrown away after a brief use, and include bottles, cups, plastic lids, bags, plates, utensils, straws, stirrers, swabs, food containers, plastic film wraps, and plastic packaging; and Whereas, Americans purchase 50 billion water bottles per year, averaging 13 bottles per month per person; and Whereas, Additionally, 100 billion plastic bags and 25 billion styrofoam plastic coffee cups are thrown away by Americans each year, which averages to 307 plastic bags and 77 cups per person per year; and Whereas, Not all single-use plastic waste reaches landfills, permanent disposal facilities, or is recycled; and Whereas, New Jerseys current post-consumer plastics recycling rates vary between six to nine percent, however, although some calculations indicate recycling rates maybe around 13 percent; and Whereas, Mismanaged single-use plastic waste may block drainage systems, release toxic fumes if burned, become land pollution, and contaminate the food chain; and Whereas, Further, unrecycled plastics are disposed of in landfills, dumpsites, incinerators, or end up in waterways and oceans where they will remain for hundreds or even thousands of years; and Whereas, Furthermore, plastic released in the environment typically does not biodegrade, but instead breaks into smaller pieces, called microplastics, which continue to accumulate in the natural environment; and Whereas, There is evidence that microplastic pollution can move through natural food webs and accumulate in fin fish and shellfish tissues, which means microplastics and associated pollutants have the potential to move into the human food chain; and Whereas, The accumulation of single-use plastics in our environment is dangerous for the residents of this State, marine wildlife, and the environment, creates visual pollution, and impacts tourism, fishing, and shipping industries; and Whereas, Efficient research needs to be conducted for the development of technologies to reuse or transform single-use plastic waste into useful products and create a marketplace for the massive volume of single-use plastics; and Whereas, It is imperative to develop a single-use plastics recycling marketplace in order to divert single use plastics from our environment, including from our oceans and landfills; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey (the Senate concurring): 1.    The Legislature respectfully urges the Department of Environmental Protection to utilize monies from the State Recycling Fund, established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1981, c.278 (C.13:1E-96), to conduct the necessary research for the development of a plastics recycling marketplace in the State in order to increase the volume of single-use plastics being recycled in the State and decrease the amount of these plastics from entering into our natural environment. 2.    The Legislature respectfully urges the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to take steps to encourage and provide funding to establish a plastics recycling marketplace in the State in order to reduce the presence of single-use plastics in our natural environment. 3.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the Governor, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, and to the Chief Executive Officer of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution respectfully urges the Department of Environmental Protection to utilize monies from the State Recycling Fund to conduct the necessary research for the development of a plastics recycling marketplace in the State in order to increase the volume of single-use plastics being recycled in the State and decrease the amount of these plastics from entering into our natural environment.  In addition, the Legislature respectfully urges the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to take steps to encourage and provide funding to establish a plastics recycling marketplace in the State in order to reduce the presence of single-use plastics in our natural environment. Single-use plastics are defined as plastic packaging and other consumer products made out of plastic that are designed to be used once and thrown away after a brief use, and include bottles, cups, plastic lids, bags, plates, utensils, straws, stirrers, swabs, food containers, plastic film wraps, and plastic packaging. Americans purchase 50 billion water bottles per year, an averaging 13 bottles per month per person.  Additionally, 100 billion plastic bags and 25 billion styrofoam plastic coffee cups are thrown away by Americans each year, which averages to 307 plastic bags and 77 cups per person per year.  Not all single-use plastic waste reaches landfills, permanent disposal facilities, or is recycled. New Jerseys current post-consumer plastics recycling rates vary between six to nine percent, however, although some calculations indicate recycling rates maybe around 13 percent. Mismanaged single-use plastic waste may block drainage systems, release toxic fumes if burned, become land pollution, and contaminate the food chain. Further, unrecycled plastics are disposed of in landfills, dumpsites, incinerators, or end up in waterways and oceans where they will remain for hundreds or even thousands of years.  Furthermore, plastic released in the environment typically does not biodegrade, but instead breaks into smaller pieces, called microplastics, which continue to accumulate in the natural environment.  There is evidence that microplastic pollution can move through natural food webs and accumulate in fin fish and shellfish tissues, which means microplastics and associated pollutants have the potential to move into the human food chain.  The accumulation of single-use plastics in our environment is dangerous for the residents of this State, marine wildlife, and the environment, creates visual pollution, and impacts tourism, fishing, and shipping industries.
