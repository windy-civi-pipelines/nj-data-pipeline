(2)   If the court finds that the person defaulted on payment of a court-imposed financial obligation, restitution, or child support or other support or maintenance ordered by a court without good cause and finds that the default was willful, the court may, in addition to the action required by paragraph (1) of this subsection a., impose a term of imprisonment or participation in a labor assistance program or enforced community service to achieve the objective of the court-imposed financial obligation, restitution, or child support or other support or maintenance ordered by a court.  These options shall not reduce the amount owed by the person in default.  The term of imprisonment or enforced community service or participation in a labor assistance program in such case shall be specified in the order of commitment. It need not be equated with any particular dollar amount but, in the case of a fine it shall not exceed one day for each $50 of the fine nor shall it exceed a period of 90 consecutive days.

When such person shall have been confined for a sufficient number of days to establish credits equal to the aggregate amount of such penalties and costs, and is not held by reason of any other sentence or commitment, he shall be discharged from such imprisonment by the officer in charge of the county jail or workhouse. c.     For the purposes of this section, "penalty" means any fine, statutorily-mandated assessment, surcharge, or other financial penalty imposed by a court pursuant to this subtitle, but does not include a surcharge imposed pursuant to subsection f. of section 1 of P.L.2000, c.75 (C.39:4-97.2). (cf: P.L.2013, c.180, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases the amount of credit that the court may give a person in default of a court imposed financial obligation or motor vehicle penalty when the person is incarcerated for the default. Under current law, the court is authorized to credit a person who is in default of a court-imposed financial obligation or a motor vehicle penalty when the person has been incarcerated for the default.  Currently, the court may order that a credit of at least $50 for each day of confinement be given against the amount owed. The provisions of this bill increase the amount of the credit that may be given from $50 to $90 for each day of confinement. This bill is based upon a recommendation contained in the June 2018 Report of the Supreme Court Committee on Municipal Court Operations, Fines, and Fees.
