<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill implements various
measures to strengthen access to reproductive health care in the State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Health Insurance</span>. The bill provides that any State program
that provides benefits for pregnancy-related care will also provide benefits
for the termination of pregnancy, and that health insurance coverage will also include
coverage for termination of pregnancy without a deductible, coinsurance,
copayment, or any other cost-sharing requirement. Under the bill, upon request
of a religious employer, a health insurer will grant an exclusion if the
coverage conflicts with the religious employers bona fide religious beliefs
and practices. &nbsp;       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Other States Civil Actions</span>. The bill declares that a law of
another state that authorizes a person to bring a civil action against a person
or entity for undertaking any of the following conduct is contrary to the
public policy of this State: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) receiving or seeking an
abortion; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) performing or inducing an
abortion; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) knowingly engaging in
conduct that aids or abets the performance, receipt, or inducement of an
abortion; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) attempting or intending to
engage in the conduct described above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This provision of the bill
will not apply to an action founded in tort, contract, or statute under the
laws of this State, or an action founded in tort, contract, or statute under
the laws of another state and for which a similar claim would exist under the
laws of this State, including, but not limited to, an alleged act of
malpractice or negligence by a person related to the persons profession or
occupation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Crime: Interference with Reproductive Health Services.</span>  The
bill creates the new crime of interference with reproductive health services.
Among other provisions, a person is guilty of the crime if the person purposely
or knowingly, with purpose to unlawfully restrict anothers access to or
receipt or provision of reproductive health services or to intimidate the
person from becoming or remaining a reproductive health services patient,
provider, volunteer, or assistant: (1) inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily
injury; (2)  obstructs any person seeking to enter into or exit from a
reproductive health services facility or place of religious worship; (3)
intimidates, threatens or coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or
coerce, any person or entity because that person or entity is a reproductive
health services patient, provider, volunteer, or assistant; (4) damages,
defaces, or destroys the property of a person, entity, or facility, or attempts
to do so, because the person, entity, or facility is a reproductive health
services patient, provider, assistant, volunteer, or facility; (5) videotapes,
films, photographs, or records by electronic means, within 100 feet of the
entrance to a reproductive health services facility, a patient, provider,
volunteer, or assistant without that persons consent, with purpose to
intimidate the person from becoming or remaining a reproductive health services
patient, provider, volunteer, or assistant; or (6) discloses or distributes a
videotape, film, photograph, or recording of the person with purpose to
intimidate the person from becoming or remaining a reproductive health services
patient, provider, volunteer, or assistant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      Interference with
reproductive health services is a crime of the fourth degree, but is a crime of
the second degree if the victim suffers significant bodily injury or serious
bodily injury. A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by a term of
imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both; a crime of
the second degree, by a term of five to 10 years, a fine of up to $150,000, or
both.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Dispersal of Gatherings.</span> The bill authorizes the Attorney
General or any law enforcement officer to order the immediate dispersal of a
gathering that substantially impedes access to or departure from an entrance or
driveway to a reproductive health care facility during the business hours of
the facility. Failure to comply with a dispersal order is a disorderly persons
offense.  A disorderly persons offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment
of up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Civil Action: Interference with Reproductive Health Services.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also authorizes a person
to bring a civil action against a person who unlawfully interferes with another
persons reproductive health services.  The court may award injunctive relief;
compensatory damages in an amount not less than liquidated damages computed at
the rate of $1,000 for each violation;  punitive damages upon proof of willful
or reckless disregard of the law;  reasonable attorneys fees and other
litigation costs; and other preliminary and equitable relief as the court
determines to be appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the Attorney
General may bring a civil action to enjoin a violation of the law, for
compensatory damages, and for the assessment of a civil penalty against each person
who violates the law. The civil penalty imposed will be up to, but not
exceeding, $10,000 for a first violation, and $25,000 for any subsequent
violation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Reproductive Health Access Fund. </span>The bill creates the
Reproductive Health Access Fund, which will be credited with moneys from an
appropriation of $20 million made pursuant to the bill, interest, and any money
from any other source. The fund will be used for the following purposes,
established pursuant to the bill:    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) $5 million  will be
appropriated for the Abortion Care Clinical Training Program; (2) $5 million 
for the Reproductive Health Security Grant Program; and (3) $10 million for
the Reproductive Health Care Facility Grant Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Abortion Care Clinical
Training Program will provide grants to develop and sustain abortion care
training programs; continuing education programs for physicians through
professional associations or other clinical education programs; and establish
training program requirements that are consistent with evidence-based training
standards, comply with applicable State law and regulations, and focus on providing
culturally congruent care and include implicit bias training.         </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Reproductive Health
Security Grant Program in the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness
will provide grants to eligible reproductive health care facilities which the
Director of the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness determines are at
a high risk of being the target of unlawful activity, including acts of
violence, property damage, vandalism, and harassment.  Grants provided under
the program will be used to hire security personnel and target-hardening
equipment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Reproductive Health
Facility Grant Program will be used to support establishing or renovating
existing health care facilities, investments in technology to facilitate care,
the recruitment and retention of staff, and other operational needs that
increase abortion care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Needs Assessment.</span> The bill requires the Department of Health
to conduct a Statewide needs assessment to examine the gaps in delivery of
reproductive health services in the State, including the impact that out-of-State
restrictions have had on the need for reproductive health services and the
provider network in the State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Medicaid Coverage.</span> Under the bill, the Department of Human
Services will ensure that expenses incurred for abortion services will be
provided with no cost-sharing to persons served under the Medicaid program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Medical Malpractice Insurers.</span> The bill bars medical
malpractice insurers from taking any adverse action, including loss of
coverage, sanctions, fines, penalties, or rate increases, against an insured
for providing or facilitating an abortion or reproductive health care service
based solely on the fact that the patient receiving the service is a resident
of a state where providing or facilitating an abortion or reproductive health
care service is illegal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Licensing Boards.</span> Finally, the bill provides that a
licensing board cannot refuse to admit a person to an examination and cannot suspend,
revoke, or refuse to renew any certificate, registration, or license based
solely on grounds that the applicant or the holder of the certificate,
registration, or license provided, authorized, participated in, referred for,
or assisted with any health care, medical service, or procedure related to an
abortion for a person who resides in a jurisdiction where these acts are
illegal, if the acts would not be a basis for these sanctions in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Repealers.</span> The bill repeals the following statutes, which
have either been obviated by court decisions or would be obviated by this bill:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     -- N.J.S.A.2A:65A-5 through N.J.S.A.2A:65A-7
(banned partial birth abortions);</p>

N.J.S.A.52:14-17.29hh, and N.J.S.A.52:14-17.46.6q (exempted religious employers
from possible requirement that health insurance issued in the State include
