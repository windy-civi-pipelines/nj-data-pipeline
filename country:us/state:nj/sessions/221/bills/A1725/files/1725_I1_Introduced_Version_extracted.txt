For the purposes of this subsection, a "motor vehicle moving violation" means any violation of the motor vehicle laws of this State for which motor vehicle points are assessed by the Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1982, c.43 (C.39:5-30.5). (cf: P.L.2002, c.28, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases the prison time for persons who are convicted of a motor vehicle offense during a period when their drivers license is suspended for a third or subsequent DUI offense or for a third or subsequent refusal to take a chemical or breathalyzer test when stopped for a suspected DUI offense. Under current law, an individual found guilty for a third or subsequent time of operating a motor vehicle while their license is suspended is subject to imprisonment in the county jail for a period of 10 days.  This bill would increase that term of imprisonment to a period of not less than 30 days or more than 180 days in those cases where the violators drivers license is suspended for a third or subsequent driving under the influence (DUI) offense or for refusing to take a breathalyzer or chemical test when stopped for a suspected DUI offense. The other penalties remain substantially the same as those for anyone convicted of driving during a period when their drivers license is suspended for a third or subsequent time:  a fine of $1,000 and the revocation of the violators motor vehicle registration privilege when the violations leading to the suspension are for the same offense.
