<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 3 of P.L.1996,
c.39 (C.2C:12-10.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  A judgment of
conviction for stalking shall operate as an application for a permanent
restraining order limiting the contact of the defendant and the victim who was
stalked<span class=HangingAnActChar> <u>. The</u></span><u> victims location
shall be confidential and shall not appear on any law enforcement or</u><b><u><sup><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'> </span></sup></u></b><u>court
documents or records to which the defendant has access</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A hearing shall be held
on the application for a permanent restraining order at the time of the verdict
or plea of guilty unless the victim requests otherwise.  This hearing shall be
in Superior Court.  A permanent restraining order may grant the following
specific relief:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   An order restraining the
defendant from entering the residence, property, school, or place of employment
of the victim and requiring the defendant to stay away from any specified place
that is named in the order and is frequented regularly by the victim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   An order restraining the
defendant from making contact with the victim, including an order forbidding
the defendant from personally or through an agent initiating any communication
likely to cause annoyance or alarm including, but not limited to, personal,
written, or telephone contact, or contact via electronic device, with the
victim, the victim's employers, employees, or fellow workers, or others with
whom communication would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm to the victim. 
As used in this paragraph, &quot;communication&quot; shall have the same
meaning as defined in subsection q. of N.J.S.2C:1-14.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The permanent
restraining order entered by the court subsequent to a conviction for stalking
as provided in this act may be dissolved upon the application of the stalking
victim to the court which granted the order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Notice of permanent restraining
orders issued pursuant to this act shall be sent by the clerk of the court or
other person designated by the court to the appropriate chiefs of police,
members of the State Police and any other appropriate law enforcement agency or
court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Any permanent
restraining order issued pursuant to this act shall be in effect throughout the
State, and shall be enforced by all law enforcement officers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A violation by the
defendant of an order issued pursuant to this act shall constitute an offense
under subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:29-9 and each order shall so state.  Violations
of these orders may be enforced in a civil or criminal action initiated by the
stalking victim or by the court, on its own motion, pursuant to applicable
court rules.  Nothing in this act shall preclude the filing of a criminal
complaint for stalking based on the same act which is the basis for the
violation of the permanent restraining order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that the
location of certain victims of assault, harassment, and stalking would be
confidential and not appear on law enforcement or court documents or records to
which the defendant has access. The bill also clarifies language in current law
concerning the confidentiality of the location of certain domestic violence
victims. The bill also adds language to the domestic violence statutes
clarifying that when a defendant is found guilty of a crime or offense
involving domestic violence, the victims location would be confidential.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 3 of P.L.1996, c.39
(C.2C:12-10.1) provides that a judgment of conviction for stalking operates as
an application for a permanent restraining order limiting the contact of the
defendant and the victim.  A hearing will be held on the application for a
permanent restraining order at the time of the verdict or plea of guilty unless
the victim requests otherwise. The bill amends this section by providing that
the victims location would be confidential and not appear on law enforcement
or court documents or records to which the defendant has access, without the
need for a specific court order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends section 2
of P.L.1999, c.47 (C.2C:12-10.2).  This statute provides that in any case
involving <i>an allegation</i> of stalking where the victim is a child under
the age of 18 or is developmentally disabled as defined in section 3 of
P.L.1977, c.200 (C.5:5-44.4) or is 18 years of age or older and has a mental
disease or defect which renders the victim temporarily or permanently incapable
of understanding the nature of his conduct, including, but not limited to,
being incapable of providing consent, the court may issue a temporary
restraining order against the defendant which limits the contact of the
defendant and the victim.  The bill provides that in these cases the victims
location would be confidential and not appear on law enforcement or court
documents or records to which the defendant has access. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that in a
criminal complaint involving <i>an allegation</i> of stalking, the victims
location would be confidential as well, and would not appear on law enforcement
or court documents or records to which the defendant has access.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under section 10 of P.L.1991,
c.261 (C.2C:25-26), when a defendant <i>charged with a crime or offense</i>
involving domestic violence is released from custody before trial on bail or
personal recognizance, the victim's location shall remain confidential and
shall not appear on any documents or records to which the defendant has access. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends section 9 of
P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-25),  which provides in pertinent part that in <i>a
criminal complaint</i> arising from a domestic violence incident, the court shall
waive any requirement that the victim's location be disclosed to any person. The
bill deletes this provision and replaces it with language providing that the
victims location would be confidential and would not appear on any law
enforcement or court documents or records to which the defendant has access.            
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends section
11 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-27).  This statute concerns procedures when a
defendant <i>is found guilty of a crime or offense</i> involving domestic
violence.  The bill clarifies that upon the defendants conviction the victims
location would remain confidential and not appear on any law enforcement or
court documents or records to which the defendant has access.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a victim of
assault or aggravated assault pursuant to N.J.S.2C:12-1, harassment pursuant to
N.J.S.2C:33-4, or cyber-harassment pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2013, c.272
(C.2C:33-4.1) could make application to the court for an order providing that
the victims location would be confidential and would not appear on any law
enforcement or court documents or records to which the defendant has access.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill
clarifies a provision in current law concerning defendants charged with sex
offenses.  Under section 2 of P.L.2007, c.133 (C.2C:14-12), when a defendant
charged with a sex offense is released from custody before trial on bail or
personal recognizance, the victim's location shall remain confidential and
shall not appear on documents or records to which the defendant has access. 
The bill clarifies that this provision would apply both to law enforcement and
to court documents and records. The bill also changes the phrase in this
section the victims location shall <i>remain</i> confidential to the
victims location shall <i>be</i> confidential to account for any possible
inconsistency concerning the previous status of the confidentiality of the
victims location.</p>
