beginning with the 2023-2024 school year, State school aid will be provided to
school districts at levels consistent with the School Funding Reform Act of
2008 (SFRA) up to their adequacy budget, and prevents future cuts to State aid.
It also requires a school district to reduce its tax levy in an amount equal to
any increase in State school aid above the prior budget year under certain
circumstances, allowing the district to subsequently increase its levy from a
lower level than the prior budget year. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent to
bring equity to New Jerseys school system by increasing State aid
contributions to SFRA adequacy budget levels in a manner consistent with the
thorough and efficient education clause in the State Constitution (N.J. Const.
art. VIII, sec. 4, par.1). Providing school aid in this manner will reduce
property taxes based on the ability of each school districts residents to
support schools.</p>

petition the Commissioner of Education and State Treasurer for additional aid
if it demonstrates a willingness to reduce its adjusted tax levy by an amount
equal to any additional aid received.</p>

district to reduce its school tax levy by the same amount of their State school
aid increase above the prior year if the total tax levy of the municipality or
municipalities comprising the district is more than five percent of school district
income. After lowering its levy commensurate with a State aid increase, a
school district may increase its levy by an amount necessary to cover an
increase in per pupil administrative costs and deferred revenue. The bill
requires a district to submit a proposal to voters of the district if it wishes
to exceed this limitation. If the voters do not approve the proposal, a school
district may add to its adjusted tax levy the difference between the maximum
amount to be raised by taxation for the current budget year and the actual
amount to be raised by taxation for the current school year if the amount of
State school aid and the adjusted tax levy is below the adequacy budget in the
next three succeeding budget years.</p>

$2,946,618,000 for the purposes of providing additional aid under the bill. The
bill stipulates that any unexpended balances are appropriated to the Schools
Development Authority for the purposes of supporting school facilities projects
and supporting emergent needs and capital maintenance in school districts.</p>
