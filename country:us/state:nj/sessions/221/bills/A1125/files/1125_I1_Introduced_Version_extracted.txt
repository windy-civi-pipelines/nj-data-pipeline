A school district that has not been granted approval to exceed the cap under paragraph (1) of subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) may, pursuant to subsection c. of this section, add to its adjusted tax levy the amount of the difference between the maximum allowable amount to be raised by taxation for the current school budget year and the actual amount to be raised by taxation for the current school budget year, provided that the sum of the amount of State school aid and the adjusted tax levy is less than the adequacy budget calculated pursuant to section 9 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-51). (cf: P.L.2011, c.202, s.3) 7. Section 11 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-53) is amended to read as follows: 11.  Each school district's and county vocational school district's equalization aid shall be calculated as follows: EQAID = AB - LSHARE provided that EQAID shall not be less than zero; and where AB is the district's adequacy budget calculated pursuant to section 9 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-51); and LSHARE is the district's local share calculated pursuant to section 10 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-52). Each district's equalization aid for general fund expenses shall be expended to provide a thorough and efficient system of education consistent with the core curriculum content standards established pursuant to section 4 of [this act] P.L.2007 ,c.260 (C.18A:7F-46). A districts equalization aid shall include such additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure that the district is funded at the amount of its adequacy budget, after consideration of the adjusted tax levy and all other amounts of State school aid to which the district is entitled, provided that the total adjusted tax levy of the municipality or municipalities, as the case may be, comprising the school district is more than five percent of the district income as defined in section 3 of P.L.2007 , c.260 (C.18A:7F-45). A school district may make an appeal to the commissioner on the amount of its equalization aid on the basis that the calculation of income within the local share formula under section 10 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-52) does not accurately reflect the district's income wealth. (cf: P.L.2007, c.260, s.11) 8. There is appropriated from the Property Tax Relief Fund to the Department of Education the sum of $2,946,618,000 for the purposes of providing additional State school aid in the 2023-2024 school year. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary and subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, any unexpended balances from this appropriation are appropriated to the Schools Development Authority for the purposes of supporting school facilities projects and supporting emergent needs and capital maintenance in school districts. 9. The following sections are repealed: Section 2 of P.L.2018, c.67 (C.18A:7F-5d); Section 3 of P.L.2018, c.67 (C.18A:7F-67); and Section 4 of P.L.2018, c.67 (C.18A:7F-68). 10. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The bill is to be known as the Fully Funding Schools and Cutting Property Taxes Act. The bill requires that, beginning with the 2023-2024 school year, State school aid will be provided to school districts at levels consistent with the School Funding Reform Act of 2008 (SFRA) up to their adequacy budget, and prevents future cuts to State aid. It also requires a school district to reduce its tax levy in an amount equal to any increase in State school aid above the prior budget year under certain circumstances, allowing the district to subsequently increase its levy from a lower level than the prior budget year. It is the sponsors intent to bring equity to New Jerseys school system by increasing State aid contributions to SFRA adequacy budget levels in a manner consistent with the thorough and efficient education clause in the State Constitution (N.J. Const. art. VIII, sec. 4, par.1). Providing school aid in this manner will reduce property taxes based on the ability of each school districts residents to support schools. The bill repeals certain sections of law enacted as part of P.L.2018, c.67 (commonly referred to S2) that resulted in loss of aid and higher property taxes in certain school districts. The bill requires the State to provide aid to school districts equal to the greatest amount of: · aid according to the SFRA; · aid according to the SFRA and, if applicable, additional aid to provided to school districts that lost funding as a result of the implementation of S2; or · State school aid received in any of the school years between and including the 2017-2018 school year and the 2022-2023 school year. Under the bill, a district may petition the Commissioner of Education and State Treasurer for additional aid if it demonstrates a willingness to reduce its adjusted tax levy by an amount equal to any additional aid received. The bill requires a school district to reduce its school tax levy by the same amount of their State school aid increase above the prior year if the total tax levy of the municipality or municipalities comprising the district is more than five percent of school district income. After lowering its levy commensurate with a State aid increase, a school district may increase its levy by an amount necessary to cover an increase in per pupil administrative costs and deferred revenue. The bill requires a district to submit a proposal to voters of the district if it wishes to exceed this limitation. If the voters do not approve the proposal, a school district may add to its adjusted tax levy the difference between the maximum amount to be raised by taxation for the current budget year and the actual amount to be raised by taxation for the current school year if the amount of State school aid and the adjusted tax levy is below the adequacy budget in the next three succeeding budget years. Lastly, the bill appropriates $2,946,618,000 for the purposes of providing additional aid under the bill. The bill stipulates that any unexpended balances are appropriated to the Schools Development Authority for the purposes of supporting school facilities projects and supporting emergent needs and capital maintenance in school districts.

A school district that has not been granted approval to exceed the cap under section 3 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.18A:7F-38), pursuant to subsection c. of this section, may add to its adjusted tax levy in any one of the next three succeeding budget years, the amount of the difference between the maximum allowable amount to be raised by taxation for the current school budget year and the actual amount to be raised by taxation for the current school budget year. A school district that has not been granted approval to exceed the cap under paragraph (1) of subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) may, pursuant to subsection c. of this section, add to its adjusted tax levy the amount of the difference between the maximum allowable amount to be raised by taxation for the current school budget year and the actual amount to be raised by taxation for the current school budget year, provided that the sum of the amount of State school aid and the adjusted tax levy is less than the adequacy budget calculated pursuant to section 9 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-51). (cf: P.L.2011, c.202, s.3) 7. Section 11 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-53) is amended to read as follows: 11.  Each school district's and county vocational school district's equalization aid shall be calculated as follows: EQAID = AB - LSHARE provided that EQAID shall not be less than zero; and where AB is the district's adequacy budget calculated pursuant to section 9 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-51); and LSHARE is the district's local share calculated pursuant to section 10 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-52). Each district's equalization aid for general fund expenses shall be expended to provide a thorough and efficient system of education consistent with the core curriculum content standards established pursuant to section 4 of [this act] P.L.2007 ,c.260 (C.18A:7F-46). A districts equalization aid shall include such additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure that the district is funded at the amount of its adequacy budget, after consideration of the adjusted tax levy and all other amounts of State school aid to which the district is entitled, provided that the total adjusted tax levy of the municipality or municipalities, as the case may be, comprising the school district is more than five percent of the district income as defined in section 3 of P.L.2007 , c.260 (C.18A:7F-45). A school district may make an appeal to the commissioner on the amount of its equalization aid on the basis that the calculation of income within the local share formula under section 10 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-52) does not accurately reflect the district's income wealth. (cf: P.L.2007, c.260, s.11) 8. There is appropriated from the Property Tax Relief Fund to the Department of Education the sum of $2,946,618,000 for the purposes of providing additional State school aid in the 2023-2024 school year. Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary and subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, any unexpended balances from this appropriation are appropriated to the Schools Development Authority for the purposes of supporting school facilities projects and supporting emergent needs and capital maintenance in school districts. 9. The following sections are repealed: Section 2 of P.L.2018, c.67 (C.18A:7F-5d); Section 3 of P.L.2018, c.67 (C.18A:7F-67); and Section 4 of P.L.2018, c.67 (C.18A:7F-68). 10. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The bill is to be known as the Fully Funding Schools and Cutting Property Taxes Act. The bill requires that, beginning with the 2023-2024 school year, State school aid will be provided to school districts at levels consistent with the School Funding Reform Act of 2008 (SFRA) up to their adequacy budget, and prevents future cuts to State aid. It also requires a school district to reduce its tax levy in an amount equal to any increase in State school aid above the prior budget year under certain circumstances, allowing the district to subsequently increase its levy from a lower level than the prior budget year. It is the sponsors intent to bring equity to New Jerseys school system by increasing State aid contributions to SFRA adequacy budget levels in a manner consistent with the thorough and efficient education clause in the State Constitution (N.J. Const. art. VIII, sec. 4, par.1). Providing school aid in this manner will reduce property taxes based on the ability of each school districts residents to support schools. The bill repeals certain sections of law enacted as part of P.L.2018, c.67 (commonly referred to S2) that resulted in loss of aid and higher property taxes in certain school districts. The bill requires the State to provide aid to school districts equal to the greatest amount of: · aid according to the SFRA; · aid according to the SFRA and, if applicable, additional aid to provided to school districts that lost funding as a result of the implementation of S2; or · State school aid received in any of the school years between and including the 2017-2018 school year and the 2022-2023 school year. Under the bill, a district may petition the Commissioner of Education and State Treasurer for additional aid if it demonstrates a willingness to reduce its adjusted tax levy by an amount equal to any additional aid received. The bill requires a school district to reduce its school tax levy by the same amount of their State school aid increase above the prior year if the total tax levy of the municipality or municipalities comprising the district is more than five percent of school district income. After lowering its levy commensurate with a State aid increase, a school district may increase its levy by an amount necessary to cover an increase in per pupil administrative costs and deferred revenue. The bill requires a district to submit a proposal to voters of the district if it wishes to exceed this limitation. If the voters do not approve the proposal, a school district may add to its adjusted tax levy the difference between the maximum amount to be raised by taxation for the current budget year and the actual amount to be raised by taxation for the current school year if the amount of State school aid and the adjusted tax levy is below the adequacy budget in the next three succeeding budget years. Lastly, the bill appropriates $2,946,618,000 for the purposes of providing additional aid under the bill. The bill stipulates that any unexpended balances are appropriated to the Schools Development Authority for the purposes of supporting school facilities projects and supporting emergent needs and capital maintenance in school districts.
