The healthcare facility or law enforcement agency is responsible for obtaining the services of a rape care advocate for the victim.  The bill requires the rape care advocate to explain his or her role on the sexual assault response team and inform the victim of all available resources, including the services of the county program.  The advocate also is to explain the importance of seeking medical attention, and the value of timely evidence collection and early reporting to law enforcement.  The advocate is to be available to privately speak with the victim prior to and during any investigative and sexual assault medical forensic interview or procedure.  It is also the responsibility of the advocate to provide the victim with a safe, neutral, and confidential place to consider options.
