The authority shall consider, for each bridge or overpass included in the study, the feasibility of adding a suicide prevention barrier to each, including an assessment of the structural impact of constructing a suicide prevention barrier on each. c.     The South Jersey Transportation Authority shall erect suicide prevention barriers on every bridge or overpass that is under the jurisdiction of the authority, is not a local or county bridge or overpass, is determined to pose a significant suicide threat, based on the results of the study required to be conducted pursuant to subsection b. of this section, and is feasible.  The authority shall determine the type of suicide prevention barrier for each bridge or overpass. d.    In the event that it is infeasible to erect a suicide prevention barrier on a bridge or overpass determined by the authority to pose a significant suicide threat, the authority shall erect secondary suicide prevention methods, including, but not limited to: surveillance systems, emergency phones connected to crisis hotlines, increased patrols, and informational signs to direct individuals to support services. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the Department of Transportation (department), the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA), and the South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) to erect suicide prevention barriers, as defined in this bill, on certain bridges or overpasses that are determined to pose a significant suicide threat.
