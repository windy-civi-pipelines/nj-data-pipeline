<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  N.J.S.18A:20-4.2 is
amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     18A:20-4.2.  The board of
education of any school district may, for school purposes: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   Purchase, take and
condemn lands within the district and lands not exceeding 50 acres in extent
without the district but situate in a municipality or municipalities adjoining
the district, but no more than 25 acres may be so acquired in any one such
municipality, without the district, except with the consent, by ordinance, of
such municipality; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Grade, drain and
landscape lands owned or to be acquired by it and improve the same in like
manner; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Erect, lease for a term
not exceeding 50 years, enlarge, improve, repair or furnish buildings;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Borrow money therefor,
with or without mortgage; in the case of a type II district without a board of
school estimate, when authorized so to do at any annual or special school
election; and in the case of a type II district having a board of school
estimate, when the amount necessary to be provided therefor shall have been
fixed, determined and certified by the board of school estimate; and in the
case of a type I district, when an ordinance authorizing expenditures for such
purpose is finally adopted by the governing body of a municipality comprised
within the district; provided, however, that no such election shall be held nor
shall any such resolution of a school estimate board or ordinance of a
municipal governing body be introduced to authorize any lease of any building
for a term exceeding one year, until the proposed terms of such lease have been
reviewed and approved by the Commissioner of Education and the Local Finance
Board in the Department of Community Affairs; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   Construct, purchase,
lease or otherwise acquire a building with the federal government, the State, a
political subdivision thereof or any other individual or entity properly
authorized to do business in the State; provided that: (1) the noneducational
uses of the building are compatible with the establishment and operation of a
school, as determined by the Commissioner of Education; (2) the portion of the
building to be used as a school meets regulations of the Department of
Education; (3) the board of education has complied with the provisions of law
and regulations relating to the selection and approval of sites; and (4) in the
case of a lease, that any lease in excess of <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>five<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>20</u>
years shall be approved by the Commissioner of Education and the Local Finance
Board in the Department of Community Affairs; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   Acquire, with the
approval of either the commissioner, or voters or board of school estimate, as
applicable, improvements or additions to school buildings through lease
purchase agreements not in excess of <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>five<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>20</u>
years.  The agreement shall be recorded as an expenditure of the General Fund
of the district.  The commissioner shall approve the agreement only upon a
demonstration by the district that the lease purchase payments and any
operating expenses related to the agreement can be included within the
district's tax levy growth limitation and will not result in the need for
approval by the voters or board of school estimate, as appropriate, of
additional spending proposals to maintain existing instructional programs and
extracurricular activities.  If the commissioner cannot approve the agreement,
the board of education may frame a separate question to authorize the lease
purchase agreement and obtain voter or board of school estimate approval to
enter into the agreement.  A district may, without separate prior approval of
the commissioner, also acquire equipment through a lease purchase agreement not
in excess of five years or in the case of a lease purchase agreement entered
into for the acquisition of fossil fuel school buses not in excess of 10 years
and in the case of a lease purchase agreement entered into for the acquisition
of electric school buses and related charging equipment and services not in
excess of the service life of the electric school buses, provided that the
amount of the first installment and each subsequent installment for the lease
purchase payments is included in the budget that is advertised and submitted
for approval to the voters of the district or the board of school estimate, as
appropriate.  As used herein, a &quot;lease purchase agreement&quot; refers to
any agreement which gives the board of education as lessee the option of
purchasing the leased equipment or improvements or additions to existing school
buildings during or upon termination of the lease, with credit toward the
purchase price of all or part of rental payments which have been made by the
board of education in accordance with the lease.  As part of such a
transaction, the board of education may transfer or lease land or rights in
land, including any building thereon, after publicly advertising for proposals
for the transfer for nominal or fair market value, to the party selected by the
board of education, by negotiation or otherwise, after determining that the
proposal is in the best interest of the taxpayers of the district, to construct
or to improve and to lease or to own or to have ownership interests in the site
and the school building to be leased pursuant to such lease purchase agreement,
notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary.  The land and
any building thereon which is described in a lease purchase agreement entered
into pursuant to this amendatory act, shall be deemed to be and treated as
property of the school district, used for school purposes pursuant to
R.S.54:4-3.3, and shall not be considered or treated as property leased to
another whose property is not exempt, and shall not be assessed as real estate
pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1949, c.177 (C.54:4-2.3).  Any lease purchase
agreement authorized by this section shall contain a provision making payments
thereunder subject to the annual appropriation of funds sufficient to meet the
required payments or shall contain an annual cancellation clause and shall
require all construction contracts let by public school districts or let by
developers or owners of property used for school purposes to be competitively
bid, pursuant to N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq.;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   Establish with an
individual or entity authorized to do business in the State a tenancy in
common, condominium, horizontal property regime or other joint ownership
arrangement on a site contributed by the school district; provided the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill extends the period
of time in which a board of education may execute certain: 1) leases with the
federal government, the State, a political subdivision of the State, or any
other individual or entity authorized to do business in the State; and 2) lease
purchase agreements for improvements or additions to school buildings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Pursuant to current law, a
board of education may lease a building from the federal government, the State,
a political subdivision of the State, or any other individual or entity
authorized to do business in the State.  To execute the lease, certain
conditions are required to be met, including a condition that any lease in
excess of five years is to be approved by the Commissioner of Education and the
Local Finance Board in the Department of Community Affairs.  This bill instead
requires commissioner and finance board approval only when the lease exceeds 20
years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law also requires
commissioner approval in cases in which a board of education seeks to acquire improvements
or additions to school buildings through lease purchase agreements.  The
agreements, however, are prohibited from exceeding five years and are to only
be approved by the commissioner if any operating expenses related to the
agreement can be included within the district's tax levy growth limitation and
will not result in the need for approval of additional spending proposals to
maintain existing instructional programs and extracurricular activities.  This
bill extends the current time limitation on these lease-purchase agreements to
20 years.  All other existing statutory requirements in regard to these lease
purchase agreements are maintained under the bill.</p>
