currently enrolled as participants of the Defined Contribution Retirement
Program (DCRP) will be eligible for an automatic transfer of all years of
service credit to PERS, if the employee elects to transfer their membership
from DCRP to PERS.  Any years of service credit transferred to PERS from DCRP
will be used to qualify members for retirement and health benefits associated
with PERS, but will not be used to calculate the amount of pension benefit.  A
participants prior contributions into the DCRP will not be transferred into
PERS and will remain in the fund.  The employee will receive a notice of the
transfer of service credit to PERS within two months following the enactment of
the bill.  Upon receiving the notice, the affected employee has six months to
notify their employer if they do not wish to become enrolled as a member and
transfer their service credit to PERS.  Employees in the DCRP who opt out of
the transfer will remain in the DCRP.  Additionally, any members of PERS who
are receiving long term disability insurance will be eligible to apply for
disability retirement as long as they apply within two calendar years following
the enactment of the bill.</p>
