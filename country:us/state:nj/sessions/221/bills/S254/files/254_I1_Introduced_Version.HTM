<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This relates to contracting
powers of certain local entities related to redevelopment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, a county
improvement authoritys ability to enter into and execute any contract &quot;necessary,
convenient, or desirable&quot; to the authoritys purposes, is subject to the &quot;Local
Public Contracts Law,&quot; P.L.1971, c. 198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.).  This bill
would provide an alternative requirement and allow a county improvement
authority to enter such contracts subject to section 34 of P.L.1979, c.275 (C.40:37A-55.1). 
That provision of the statutory law sets forth the authoritys power to address
and provide for the redevelopment of blighted and deteriorating areas.  Expanding
a county improvement authoritys ability to contract for redevelopment purposes
will allow for more flexibility and greater opportunity to participate in
redevelopment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends the &quot;Local
Public Contracts Law&quot; to allow any contract that exceeds the bid threshold
to be negotiated and awarded by a contracting units governing body, without
public advertising for bids and bidding, if the contract is for the provision
or performance of goods or services when acting in connection with a redevelopment
plan adopted in accordance with section 7 of the &quot;Local Redevelopment and
Housing Law,&quot; P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-7).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill further amends the &quot;Local
Redevelopment and Housing Law,&quot; P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.), to
clarify that municipalities and designated redevelopment entities may
negotiate, arrange, or contract with public agencies or redevelopers for the
planning, replanning, construction, or undertaking of any project or
redevelopment work without public bidding.  The bill further specifies that a
municipality or designated redevelopment entity may do so at such prices and
upon such terms as it deems reasonable, if the project or redevelopment work is
undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment plan adopted in accordance with section
7 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-7).</p>
