(cf: P.L.2021, c.402, s.22) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes a State aid reduction cap for the calculation of State school aid in any fiscal year. The bill ensures that the amount of State school aid disbursed to a district in a fiscal year is never less than the prior years amount of aid by an amount greater than the State aid reduction cap. Under the bill, the State aid reduction cap for a school district, in any year in which the amount of State school aid is determined in accordance with P.L.2018, c.67 (commonly referred to as S2), is equal to 15 percent of the amount of aid in the prebudget year. In effect, a school district would receive at least 85 percent of the amount of aid received in the prebudget year. Additionally, under the bill, the State aid reduction cap for a school district, in any year in which the amount of State school aid is determined in accordance with the School Funding Reform Act of 2008, is equal to five percent of the amount of aid in the prebudget year. Consequently, a school district would receive at least 95 percent of the amount of aid received in the prebudget year.
