Under the bill, providers are also required to obtain a signed consent form from the parent or guardian of a child stating that the parent or guardian: understands any potential risks or side effects of the drug, is aware of any evidenced-based alternatives to the use of the drug; and has been informed of the existing tools available from the FDA to report adverse effects of the drug on the child and to research reports of adverse effects of the drug on other patients.  The provider is to retain this signed consent form in the childs patient file.
