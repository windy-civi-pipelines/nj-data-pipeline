The stewardship organization may conduct a financial review of the stewardship assessments remitted by retailers and renovators to the mattress recycling organization to verify that the assessments paid are proper and accurate and to confirm that all parties required by to pay or collect the assessment are paying or collecting the proper amount.  The financial review shall be carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing practices and shall be limited in scope to confirm whether the stewardship assessment has been properly collected on all sales of mattresses to consumers in the State.  The stewardship organization shall hire independent third-party auditors to conduct the financial review.  The stewardship organization shall provide to the department a copy of such financial review reports. c.  The department shall actively supervise the conduct of a stewardship organization in establishing, administering, collecting, and disbursing the mattress stewardship assessment. 8.  a.  There is established the Mattress Stewardship Fund as a separate, non-lapsing fund in the Department of the Treasury.  The Mattress Stewardship Fund shall be credited with all surcharges, interest, penalties, and other amounts collected and paid to the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury pursuant to this section.  Moneys in the Mattress Stewardship Fund shall be expended only to: (1) administer and enforce the provisions of this act; or (2) implement an approved mattress stewardship plan.  Prior to making an expenditure from the fund, the department shall consult with the stewardship organization implementing an approved mattress stewardship plan and shall follow the recommendations of the stewardship organization regarding expenditures from the fund, provided that the department determines that the expenditures are in the public interest. b.  Monies deposited in the fund shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in public depositories, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.236 (C.17:9-41), and may be invested or reinvested in such securities as are approved by the State Treasurer.  Interest or other income earned on monies deposited into the fund shall be credited to the fund for use as set forth in subsection a. of this section for other monies in the fund. c.  Moneys appropriated from the Mattress Stewardship Fund shall not replace or reduce the allocation of any other funding. 9.  a.  The department shall have the authority to enter upon and inspect, at any time, any public or private property, premises, or place for the purpose of investigating an actual or suspected violation of this act, all in accordance with due process of law. b.  The department shall publish, and update on a continual basis, a list on its Internet website of all producers, renovators, and retailers that are in compliance with the provisions of this act. c.  Upon a written finding by the department, that a producer, renovator, or retailer has not complied with the requirements of this act, in addition to other penalties authorized under section 10 of this act, the department may, after affording the producer, renovator, or retailer a reasonable opportunity to respond to, or rebut, the finding to ensure compliance with the requirements of this act, remove the producer, renovator, or retailer from the list of compliant producers, renovators, and retailers published on the departments Internet website pursuant to subsection b. of this section. 10.  a.  Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated any provision of this act, any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or has knowingly made a false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this act, the commissioner may: (1)   issue an order, in accordance with subsection c. of this section, requiring the violator to comply with the provisions of this act, the rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the stewardship plan approved thereunder, as the case may be; (2)   bring a civil action in accordance with subsection d. of this section; (3)   levy a civil administrative penalty in accordance with subsection e. of this section; (4)   bring an action for a civil penalty in accordance with subsection f. of this section; or (5) notify the public of a producer, renovator, or retailer that is not in compliance with the requirements of this act. b.    Pursuit of any of the remedies specified under this section shall not preclude the seeking of any other remedy specified. c.     Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated the provisions of this act, any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, the commissioner may issue an administrative enforcement order to the person:  specifying the provision or provisions that the person has violated; citing the action that constituted the violation; requiring the person's compliance with the provision violated; and giving notice of the person's right to a hearing on the matters contained in the administrative enforcement order.  The person subject to the order shall have 20 calendar days from receipt of the order within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing, and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order.  If no hearing is requested, the order shall become final after the expiration of the 20-day period.  A request for hearing shall not automatically stay the effect of the order. d.    The commissioner shall be authorized to institute a civil action in Superior Court for appropriate relief from any violation of the provisions of this act, or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or of a stewardship plan approved thereunder.  Such relief may include, singly or in combination: (1)   a temporary or permanent injunction; (2)   recovery of the reasonable costs of any investigation or inspection that led to the discovery of the violation, and for the recovery of the reasonable costs of preparing and bringing a civil action commenced under this subsection; (3)   recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the State in removing, correcting, or terminating the adverse effects resulting from the violation for which a civil action has been commenced and brought under this subsection; and (4)   recovery of compensatory damages caused by a violation for which a civil action has been commenced and brought under this subsection.  Assessments under this subsection shall be paid to the State Treasurer, except that compensatory damages may be paid by specific order of the court to any persons who have been aggrieved by the violation. e.     (1)  The commissioner shall be authorized to assess a civil administrative penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, provided that each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  In assessing a civil administrative penalty, the commissioner shall consider the severity of the violation, the measures taken to prevent further violations, and whether the penalty will act as an appropriate deterrent. (2)   Prior to the assessment of a civil administrative penalty under this subsection, the person committing the violation shall be notified by certified mail or personal service that the penalty is being assessed.  The notice shall identify the section of the statute, rule, regulation, or order, or the provision of the stewardship plan, that was violated; recite the facts alleged to constitute a violation; state the basis for the amount of the civil administrative penalties to be assessed; and affirm the rights of the alleged violator to a hearing.  The ordered party shall have 20 days from receipt of the notice within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine specified in the notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a final order after the expiration of the 20-day period.  Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order. (3)   The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement provisions in this act, and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this section in an amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate. f.     A person who violates any provision of this act, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or the provisions of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or a court order issued pursuant to subsection d. of this section, or who fails to pay a civil administrative penalty in full pursuant to subsection e. of this section, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement on any application, record, report, or other document required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 per day of the violation, and each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected with costs in a summary proceeding pursuant to the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), or may be collected in a civil action commenced by the commissioner.  In addition to any penalties, costs, or interest charges, the Superior Court, or the municipal court as the case may be, may assess against the violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the violation. g.    All penalties collected by the department pursuant to this act shall be deposited into the Mattress Stewardship Fund established pursuant to section 8 of this act, and appropriated annually for the continued administration and enforcement of this act. 11.  a.  Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, the establishment, administration, setting, collection, and disbursement of the stewardship assessment by a stewardship organization shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of any State law relating to antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair trade practices, or the regulation of trade or commerce, so long as the action is necessary to plan for or implement a mattress stewardship program. b.  The provisions of subsection a. of this section shall not apply to: (1) any agreement establishing or affecting the price of a mattress unrelated to the mattress stewardship assessment; or (2) any agreement restricting the output or production of a mattress or the geographic area or customers to which a mattress will be sold. 12.  a.  No later than July 1 of the year after a mattress stewardship program is implemented, and annually thereafter, a stewardship organization shall prepare and submit a written report to the department evaluating the implementation of the mattress stewardship program.  Each annual report shall include, the following information: (1) the total sales of mattresses sold to consumers in the State in the previous calendar year by producers, renovators, and retailers registered with the stewardship organization;

(7) the strategies that the stewardship organization will take to address discarded mattresses that are not program mattresses and discarded mattresses that are illegally dumped; (8) a summary of the public education offered in the previous calendar year that supports the mattress stewardship program and examples of public education materials; (9) an evaluation of the effectiveness of methods and processes used to achieve the approved program plan goals of the mattress stewardship program, information on progress made toward achieving the goals, an explanation of why any goals were not met during the previous calendar year, if applicable, and any options for improving progress toward meeting the goals in the future, if applicable; (10) a report by an independent certified public accountant, retained by the stewardship organization at the stewardship organizations expense, providing the accountants audit of the stewardship organizations financial statements; (11) a report on the outcome of the financial review of any entities the stewardship organization contracts with; (12) recommendations for changes to the mattress stewardship program; and (13) an updated operating budget for the mattress stewardship program for the upcoming calendar year. b.  Within 90 days of receiving an annual report submitted to the department pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the department shall: (1) review the report;

STATEMENT This bill would require every producer of mattresses sold in the State to join a stewardship organization in order to implement a mattress stewardship program.  The purpose of a mattress stewardship program is to provide for the environmentally sound management of discarded mattresses in the State. The bill would require a stewardship organization to prepare and submit a plan to the Department of Environmental Protection (department) for the development and implementation of a mattress stewardship program.  The bill would also establish a process for proposed amendments to the plan and would require a stewardship organization to provide notice to the department prior to implementing certain changes to an approved plan. The bill would also require each retailer or renovator that sells or offers for sale mattresses in this State to register with a stewardship organization and comply with the bills provisions. Beginning one year after the bills effective date, a producer, a renovator, or retailer would be prohibited from selling or offering for sale any mattress in the State unless the producer, renovator, or retailer is registered with a stewardship organization. Under a mattress stewardship program, a retailer would be required to: (1) purchase a mattress only from a producer or renovator that is registered with a stewardship organization; (2) collect the mattress stewardship assessment and remit the stewardship assessment to the stewardship organization, unless the retailer or renovator elects to cover the costs of the stewardship assessment; and (3) provide to consumers information on collection opportunities for discarded mattresses.  The bill would allow a retailer or renovator to elect to directly pay the applicable charge of the stewardship assessment to the stewardship organization on behalf of the consumer or ultimate end user of the mattress if the retailer or renovator enters into a written agreement with the stewardship organization to remit the applicable charge of the stewardship assessment to the stewardship organization on behalf of the consumer. The department would also be required to publish a list on its Internet website of all producers, renovators, and retailers that are in compliance with the bills provisions and update the list to remove producers, renovators, or retailers that are found to not be in compliance. The bill also provides that when the department determines that any producer, renovator, or retailer is in violation of the bills provisions, the department may assess a civil administrative penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation and a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, and each day of violation would constitute an additional, separate, and distinct violation. Finally, the bill would require, no later than July 1 of the year a mattress stewardship program is implemented, and annually thereafter, a stewardship organization to prepare and submit a written report to the department evaluating the implementation of the mattress stewardship program.  Within 90 days of receiving the initial annual report, the department would be required to establish an annual fee to be paid by the stewardship organization that is reasonably calculated to cover the actual costs of the department to administer, implement, and enforce the bills provisions.  For future years, the department would be required to provide notice to a stewardship organization, no later than April 1 of each year, of the annual fee for the upcoming calendar year. All penalties and annual fees collected by the department would be required to be deposited in the Mattress Stewardship Fund, established by the bill.

(2) collect, at the point of sale, the mattress stewardship assessment established pursuant to a plan approved by the department pursuant to section 4 of this act and remit the stewardship assessment to the stewardship organization that implements the mattress stewardship program, except as provided in subsection c. of this section if the retailer or renovator elects to cover the costs of the stewardship assessment; and (3) provide to consumers, at the point of sale, information on collection opportunities for discarded mattresses through the mattress stewardship program. c.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section, a retailer or renovator may directly pay the applicable charge of the stewardship assessment to the stewardship organization on behalf of the consumer or ultimate end user of the mattress if the retailer or renovator enters into a written agreement with the stewardship organization to remit the applicable charge of the stewardship assessment to the stewardship organization on behalf of the consumer.  A retailer or renovator that elects to cover the costs of the stewardship assessment pursuant to this subsection may make the charge visible on the receipt, invoice, or functionally equivalent document. d.  Beginning on the date that a mattress stewardship program has been implemented in the State, a retailer shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this section, if on the date the mattress was ordered from the producer or its agent, the producer of the mattress brand is listed on the departments Internet website as implementing or participating in an approved mattress stewardship program. e.  A retailer or renovator shall identify the mattress stewardship assessment as a separate line item on the receipt, invoice, or functionally equivalent document for a mattress provided to a consumer at the point of sale, except as provided in subsection c. of this section if the retailer or renovator elects to cover the costs of the stewardship assessment. f.  In implementing a mattress stewardship program, the stewardship organization shall make available on the stewardship organizations Internet website and upon request: (1) information on registered brands provided to the stewardship organization by the producers and renovators registered with the stewardship organization; (2) information on available mattress collection opportunities; and (3) any other information that may be necessary for retailers to comply with the requirements of this section. g.  In implementing a mattress stewardship program, a stewardship organization may, if included in the plan approved by the department pursuant to section 4 of this act: (1) provide for collection sites at permitted solid waste facilities or other suitable sites throughout the State for the collection of discarded mattresses, provided such sites do not impose a fee for making space available for storage containers that the stewardship organization shall provide at no charge;

The stewardship organization may conduct a financial review of the stewardship assessments remitted by retailers and renovators to the mattress recycling organization to verify that the assessments paid are proper and accurate and to confirm that all parties required by to pay or collect the assessment are paying or collecting the proper amount.  The financial review shall be carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing practices and shall be limited in scope to confirm whether the stewardship assessment has been properly collected on all sales of mattresses to consumers in the State.  The stewardship organization shall hire independent third-party auditors to conduct the financial review.  The stewardship organization shall provide to the department a copy of such financial review reports. c.  The department shall actively supervise the conduct of a stewardship organization in establishing, administering, collecting, and disbursing the mattress stewardship assessment. 8.  a.  There is established the Mattress Stewardship Fund as a separate, non-lapsing fund in the Department of the Treasury.  The Mattress Stewardship Fund shall be credited with all surcharges, interest, penalties, and other amounts collected and paid to the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury pursuant to this section.  Moneys in the Mattress Stewardship Fund shall be expended only to: (1) administer and enforce the provisions of this act; or (2) implement an approved mattress stewardship plan.  Prior to making an expenditure from the fund, the department shall consult with the stewardship organization implementing an approved mattress stewardship plan and shall follow the recommendations of the stewardship organization regarding expenditures from the fund, provided that the department determines that the expenditures are in the public interest. b.  Monies deposited in the fund shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in public depositories, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.236 (C.17:9-41), and may be invested or reinvested in such securities as are approved by the State Treasurer.  Interest or other income earned on monies deposited into the fund shall be credited to the fund for use as set forth in subsection a. of this section for other monies in the fund. c.  Moneys appropriated from the Mattress Stewardship Fund shall not replace or reduce the allocation of any other funding. 9.  a.  The department shall have the authority to enter upon and inspect, at any time, any public or private property, premises, or place for the purpose of investigating an actual or suspected violation of this act, all in accordance with due process of law. b.  The department shall publish, and update on a continual basis, a list on its Internet website of all producers, renovators, and retailers that are in compliance with the provisions of this act. c.  Upon a written finding by the department, that a producer, renovator, or retailer has not complied with the requirements of this act, in addition to other penalties authorized under section 10 of this act, the department may, after affording the producer, renovator, or retailer a reasonable opportunity to respond to, or rebut, the finding to ensure compliance with the requirements of this act, remove the producer, renovator, or retailer from the list of compliant producers, renovators, and retailers published on the departments Internet website pursuant to subsection b. of this section. 10.  a.  Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated any provision of this act, any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or has knowingly made a false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this act, the commissioner may: (1)   issue an order, in accordance with subsection c. of this section, requiring the violator to comply with the provisions of this act, the rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the stewardship plan approved thereunder, as the case may be; (2)   bring a civil action in accordance with subsection d. of this section; (3)   levy a civil administrative penalty in accordance with subsection e. of this section; (4)   bring an action for a civil penalty in accordance with subsection f. of this section; or (5) notify the public of a producer, renovator, or retailer that is not in compliance with the requirements of this act. b.    Pursuit of any of the remedies specified under this section shall not preclude the seeking of any other remedy specified. c.     Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated the provisions of this act, any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, the commissioner may issue an administrative enforcement order to the person:  specifying the provision or provisions that the person has violated; citing the action that constituted the violation; requiring the person's compliance with the provision violated; and giving notice of the person's right to a hearing on the matters contained in the administrative enforcement order.  The person subject to the order shall have 20 calendar days from receipt of the order within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing, and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order.  If no hearing is requested, the order shall become final after the expiration of the 20-day period.  A request for hearing shall not automatically stay the effect of the order. d.    The commissioner shall be authorized to institute a civil action in Superior Court for appropriate relief from any violation of the provisions of this act, or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or of a stewardship plan approved thereunder.  Such relief may include, singly or in combination: (1)   a temporary or permanent injunction; (2)   recovery of the reasonable costs of any investigation or inspection that led to the discovery of the violation, and for the recovery of the reasonable costs of preparing and bringing a civil action commenced under this subsection; (3)   recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the State in removing, correcting, or terminating the adverse effects resulting from the violation for which a civil action has been commenced and brought under this subsection; and (4)   recovery of compensatory damages caused by a violation for which a civil action has been commenced and brought under this subsection.  Assessments under this subsection shall be paid to the State Treasurer, except that compensatory damages may be paid by specific order of the court to any persons who have been aggrieved by the violation. e.     (1)  The commissioner shall be authorized to assess a civil administrative penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, provided that each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  In assessing a civil administrative penalty, the commissioner shall consider the severity of the violation, the measures taken to prevent further violations, and whether the penalty will act as an appropriate deterrent. (2)   Prior to the assessment of a civil administrative penalty under this subsection, the person committing the violation shall be notified by certified mail or personal service that the penalty is being assessed.  The notice shall identify the section of the statute, rule, regulation, or order, or the provision of the stewardship plan, that was violated; recite the facts alleged to constitute a violation; state the basis for the amount of the civil administrative penalties to be assessed; and affirm the rights of the alleged violator to a hearing.  The ordered party shall have 20 days from receipt of the notice within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine specified in the notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a final order after the expiration of the 20-day period.  Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order. (3)   The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement provisions in this act, and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this section in an amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate. f.     A person who violates any provision of this act, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or the provisions of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or a court order issued pursuant to subsection d. of this section, or who fails to pay a civil administrative penalty in full pursuant to subsection e. of this section, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement on any application, record, report, or other document required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 per day of the violation, and each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected with costs in a summary proceeding pursuant to the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), or may be collected in a civil action commenced by the commissioner.  In addition to any penalties, costs, or interest charges, the Superior Court, or the municipal court as the case may be, may assess against the violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the violation. g.    All penalties collected by the department pursuant to this act shall be deposited into the Mattress Stewardship Fund established pursuant to section 8 of this act, and appropriated annually for the continued administration and enforcement of this act. 11.  a.  Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, the establishment, administration, setting, collection, and disbursement of the stewardship assessment by a stewardship organization shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of any State law relating to antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair trade practices, or the regulation of trade or commerce, so long as the action is necessary to plan for or implement a mattress stewardship program. b.  The provisions of subsection a. of this section shall not apply to: (1) any agreement establishing or affecting the price of a mattress unrelated to the mattress stewardship assessment; or (2) any agreement restricting the output or production of a mattress or the geographic area or customers to which a mattress will be sold. 12.  a.  No later than July 1 of the year after a mattress stewardship program is implemented, and annually thereafter, a stewardship organization shall prepare and submit a written report to the department evaluating the implementation of the mattress stewardship program.  Each annual report shall include, the following information: (1) the total sales of mattresses sold to consumers in the State in the previous calendar year by producers, renovators, and retailers registered with the stewardship organization; (2) the mattress stewardship programs total costs and revenues for the previous calendar year; (3) information on the amount and tonnage of discarded mattresses collected pursuant to the mattress stewardship program for recycling during the previous calendar year;

STATEMENT This bill would require every producer of mattresses sold in the State to join a stewardship organization in order to implement a mattress stewardship program.  The purpose of a mattress stewardship program is to provide for the environmentally sound management of discarded mattresses in the State. The bill would require a stewardship organization to prepare and submit a plan to the Department of Environmental Protection (department) for the development and implementation of a mattress stewardship program.  The bill would also establish a process for proposed amendments to the plan and would require a stewardship organization to provide notice to the department prior to implementing certain changes to an approved plan. The bill would also require each retailer or renovator that sells or offers for sale mattresses in this State to register with a stewardship organization and comply with the bills provisions. Beginning one year after the bills effective date, a producer, a renovator, or retailer would be prohibited from selling or offering for sale any mattress in the State unless the producer, renovator, or retailer is registered with a stewardship organization. Under a mattress stewardship program, a retailer would be required to: (1) purchase a mattress only from a producer or renovator that is registered with a stewardship organization; (2) collect the mattress stewardship assessment and remit the stewardship assessment to the stewardship organization, unless the retailer or renovator elects to cover the costs of the stewardship assessment; and (3) provide to consumers information on collection opportunities for discarded mattresses.  The bill would allow a retailer or renovator to elect to directly pay the applicable charge of the stewardship assessment to the stewardship organization on behalf of the consumer or ultimate end user of the mattress if the retailer or renovator enters into a written agreement with the stewardship organization to remit the applicable charge of the stewardship assessment to the stewardship organization on behalf of the consumer. The department would also be required to publish a list on its Internet website of all producers, renovators, and retailers that are in compliance with the bills provisions and update the list to remove producers, renovators, or retailers that are found to not be in compliance. The bill also provides that when the department determines that any producer, renovator, or retailer is in violation of the bills provisions, the department may assess a civil administrative penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation and a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 for each violation, and each day of violation would constitute an additional, separate, and distinct violation. Finally, the bill would require, no later than July 1 of the year a mattress stewardship program is implemented, and annually thereafter, a stewardship organization to prepare and submit a written report to the department evaluating the implementation of the mattress stewardship program.  Within 90 days of receiving the initial annual report, the department would be required to establish an annual fee to be paid by the stewardship organization that is reasonably calculated to cover the actual costs of the department to administer, implement, and enforce the bills provisions.  For future years, the department would be required to provide notice to a stewardship organization, no later than April 1 of each year, of the annual fee for the upcoming calendar year. All penalties and annual fees collected by the department would be required to be deposited in the Mattress Stewardship Fund, established by the bill.
