SJR50 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION No. 50 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  PAUL D. MORIARTY District 4 (Atlantic, Camden and Gloucester) Senator  ANGELA V. MCKNIGHT District 31 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS Designates November of each year as Caregivers Awareness Month. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Joint Resolution designating November of each year as Caregivers Awareness Month. Whereas, An estimated 65.7 million people in the United States, 29 percent of the countrys population, serve as unpaid family caregivers each year, and on average, provide 20.4 hours per week of care; and Whereas, About seven in ten caregivers take care of another individual 50 years of age or older, approximately 14 percent of caregivers take care of an adult from 18 years of age to 49 years of age, and approximately 14 percent of caregivers care for a special needs child; and Whereas, Nearly one-third of all caregivers find their duties to be a high burden and consider their circumstances to be emotionally stressful; and Whereas, Seventeen percent of caregivers report that their health has deteriorated as a result of their caregiving duties, and the longer a caregiver has been providing care, the more likely the caregiver is to report health issues; and Whereas, Caregivers who have been providing care for five or more years are nearly twice as likely as shorter-term caregivers to report a decline in their health; and Whereas, Approximately 73 percent of caregivers were employed at some point while providing care, and among those working, two-thirds of caregivers have gone in late, left early or taken time off during the work day to address caregiving issues; and Whereas, Most caregivers have not obtained formal training and approximately 78 percent of caregivers feel they need more help or information with respect to caregiving issues; and Whereas, Almost half of all caregivers perform complex medical/nursing tasks for the individuals in their care, and more than 15 million caregivers are providing care to loved ones with Alzheimers disease; and Whereas, Due to the increase in cases of many childhood conditions, increased numbers of parents are caring for children with special needs; and Whereas, Approximately 11 percent of caregivers have served in the armed forces and approximately 17 percent of all individuals receiving care have served in the armed forces, many with traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder; and Whereas, The value of the services provided by family caregivers each year is approximately $450 billion, twice as much as homecare and nursing home services combined; and Whereas, On November 1, 2012, the President of the United States declared November 2012 as National Family Caregivers Month, recognizing  the immeasurable impact of caregivers on the lives of the individuals in their care; and Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper, and in the public interest, for the State of New Jersey to designate November of each year as Caregivers Awareness Month; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    November of each year is designated as Caregivers Awareness Month to honor caregivers and raise awareness as to the many challenges they face. 2.    The Governor is requested to annually issue a proclamation and call upon public officials, and all citizens of this State, to observe Caregivers Awareness Month with appropriate programs and events. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates November of each year as Caregivers Awareness Month and recognizes the 65 million voluntary family caregivers in the United States. Caregiving is not a one size fits all obligation, and caregivers find themselves caring for individuals of all ages and various needs. Conditions such as Alzheimers disease and dementia are commonly the basis for caregiving for the elderly, with five million individuals in the U.S. suffering from Alzheimers disease alone. Additionally, the incidence of various childhood conditions is increasing, and therefore many parents are caregivers for children with special needs. Further, many veterans of the armed forces, including those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries, require the assistance of caregivers. The value of the services provided by these caregivers, which often involves complex medical or nursing tasks, is approximately $450 billion per year. Despite providing such complex care, most caregivers have not obtained formal training. Moreover, the average amount of time spent by caregivers for their caregiving duties is 20.4 hours per week, and as the majority of caregivers are also employed, this commitment is quite considerable. The commitment of these caregivers to their loved ones often comes at a price to the caregivers themselves. Many caregivers find their duties to be emotionally stressful and highly burdensome. The longer an individual acts in a caregiver capacity, the more likely it is that individual will experience a deterioration of health. More than three-quarters of all caregivers feel that they need more help or information with respect to various caregiving topics.
