Such permits shall only be issued to persons who can provide proof to the satisfaction of the governing body that they own or lease and operate the motor vehicle and that they reside at the location specified thereon.  The permit shall be 5 1/2 inches by 8 1/2 inches in size, shall bear an appropriate certification of authenticity, and shall be displayed prominently within the vehicle when it is parked so as to be seen from the middle of the street.  Only a motor vehicle for which a valid permit has been issued and which has the permit properly displayed shall be parked in the restricted volunteer firefighter parking space indicated on the permit. 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would permit a municipality that has a volunteer fire department to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or regulation permitting the establishment of restricted parking spaces in front of volunteer firefighters homes. The designation of restricted volunteer firefighter parking spaces would only be permitted if it would not interfere with the normal flow of traffic. A municipality that designates such parking spaces would issue permits to volunteer firefighters.  The permits would identify the specific motor vehicle and the location where the vehicle may be parked.  The permit would need to be displayed prominently within the vehicle when it is parked so as to be seen from the middle of the street.

(cf: P.L.2008, c.110, s.2) 4.    (New section)  a.  Any municipality which has a duly organized volunteer fire company may, by ordinance, resolution, or regulation, establish a restricted volunteer firefighter parking space in front of a residence occupied by a volunteer firefighter if a permit has been issued for a vehicle owned or leased and operated by the volunteer firefighter pursuant to subsection b. of this section, provided such parking is not otherwise prohibited and the permitting thereof would not interfere with the normal flow of traffic. b.    Any municipality enacting an ordinance, resolution, or regulation, pursuant to this section shall provide for the issuance of permits to volunteer firefighters which identify a specific motor vehicle and the location wherein it may be parked. Such permits shall only be issued to persons who can provide proof to the satisfaction of the governing body that they own or lease and operate the motor vehicle and that they reside at the location specified thereon.  The permit shall be 5 1/2 inches by 8 1/2 inches in size, shall bear an appropriate certification of authenticity, and shall be displayed prominently within the vehicle when it is parked so as to be seen from the middle of the street.  Only a motor vehicle for which a valid permit has been issued and which has the permit properly displayed shall be parked in the restricted volunteer firefighter parking space indicated on the permit. 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would permit a municipality that has a volunteer fire department to adopt an ordinance, resolution, or regulation permitting the establishment of restricted parking spaces in front of volunteer firefighters homes. The designation of restricted volunteer firefighter parking spaces would only be permitted if it would not interfere with the normal flow of traffic. A municipality that designates such parking spaces would issue permits to volunteer firefighters.  The permits would identify the specific motor vehicle and the location where the vehicle may be parked.  The permit would need to be displayed prominently within the vehicle when it is parked so as to be seen from the middle of the street.
