STATEMENT This Assembly Resolution condemns the Peoples Republic of Chinas treatment of the Uyghur ethnic group.  The Peoples Republic of China is reportedly repressing, mistreating, and interning over one million Uyghurs because the Uyghur ethnic group is predominately Muslim.  This Assembly Resolution demonstrates the General Assemblys commitment to freedom and popular self-determination both at home and around the world.
