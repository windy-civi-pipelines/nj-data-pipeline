The Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List, including any revision thereof or supplement thereto, shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the General Assembly on or before July 1 of each year.  The Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List shall be submitted to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1) at least once in each fiscal year.  The Secretary and the Clerk shall cause the date of submission to be entered upon the Senate Journal and the Minutes of the General Assembly, respectively. Any transportation infrastructure project or the project sponsor thereof not identified in the Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List shall not be eligible for a short-term or temporary loan from the Interim Transportation Financing Program Fund.  The trust may revise or supplement the Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List no more than four times during the fiscal year, and shall submit the revised list to the Legislature when the revisions are made. No funds may be disbursed pursuant to this subsection for transportation project, aviation project, or marine project activities prior to certification in writing, from the trust, that the project activities satisfy the provisions of P.L.1985, c.334 (C.58:11B-1 et seq.), P.L.1997, c.224 (C.58:11B-10.1 et al.), or sections 22 and 34 through 38 of P.L.2016, c.56 (C.58:11B-10.3 through C.58:11B-10.5, C.58:11B-20.2, C.58:11B-22.3, and C.58:11B-22.4).  Construction activities for a transportation project shall also require written notification of award concurrence from the Department of Transportation prior to fund disbursement. h.  The Department of Environmental Protection and the trust shall provide that priority for principal forgiveness shall be given to municipalities in coastal areas, for loans issued pursuant to this section in support of environmental infrastructure projects.  As used in this subsection, "coastal area" means the same as the term is defined in section 4 of P.L.1973, c.185 (C.13:19-4). (cf:  P.L.2023, c.63, s.14) 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would requires the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (I-Bank) to provide priority for principal forgiveness on environmental infrastructure project loans to municipalities in coastal areas.  The DEP and the I-Bank finance the State's Water Bank program, which provides financing, in the form of low-interest loans, often with a certain amount of principal forgiveness, in support of wastewater and drinking water projects throughout the State.

The Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List, including any revision thereof or supplement thereto, shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the General Assembly on or before July 1 of each year.  The Interim Transportation Financing Program Project Priority List shall be submitted to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1) at least once in each fiscal year.  The Secretary and the Clerk shall cause the date of submission to be entered upon the Senate Journal and the Minutes of the General Assembly, respectively.

(cf:  P.L.2023, c.63, s.14) 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would requires the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (I-Bank) to provide priority for principal forgiveness on environmental infrastructure project loans to municipalities in coastal areas.  The DEP and the I-Bank finance the State's Water Bank program, which provides financing, in the form of low-interest loans, often with a certain amount of principal forgiveness, in support of wastewater and drinking water projects throughout the State.
