(cf: P.L.2007, c.260, s.80) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately and apply to sales made on or after the first day of the third month following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill exempts the surviving spouses and surviving civil union partners of veterans who were completely disabled in active service in time of war from the basic and supplemental fee components of the realty transfer fee. Under current law, senior citizens and persons with disabilities who sell their one- or two-family residential home are exempted from the basic fee and the supplemental fee. This exemption is not available to the surviving spouse of a senior citizen or the surviving spouse of a person with a disability unless the surviving spouse is a senior citizen or a person with a disability. This bill allows the basic and supplemental realty transfer fee rates to the sale of any one- or two-family home of the surviving spouse or surviving partner of a disabled veteran who, at the time of the disabled veterans death, qualified for the property tax exemption for the residential premises allowed to veterans who were 100 percent disabled in active service in time of war if the sale is made by the survivor during the survivors widowhood or widowerhood.  These surviving spouses and partners have endured the anxiety of separation experienced by all those who have had a loved one sent into active military service, and then shared the sacrifice of the veterans who have bought the destruction of war home with them.
