To cover the cost to the municipality of conducting inspections under this act, the municipality may, by ordinance, establish fees, which shall be paid into the treasury of the municipality to which the local enforcing agency is responsible, and which shall be appropriated by the municipality to the local enforcing agency to pay the cost of enforcing this act. b.    A local enforcing agency consisting of or employing at least one paid fire inspector who is certified pursuant to subsection c. of this section may elect to inspect high-rise structures and life hazard uses within its jurisdiction, in lieu of inspection by the commissioner.  That election shall be made by resolution of the governing body having jurisdiction over the local enforcing agency.  If an appropriate resolution has not been received by the commissioner on or before the effective date of this act, the department shall perform all inspections under this subsection until such time as the governing body shall adopt and send to the commissioner an appropriate resolution.  A local enforcing agency that elects to inspect high-rise structures and life hazard uses may issue the certificates of inspection required to be issued pursuant to section 14 of this act and may inspect buildings and premises other than high-rise structures and life hazard uses in order to secure compliance with this act. c.     The commissioner shall certify fire inspectors under this act in accordance with such standards as he shall establish by regulation; provided that a fire inspector certificate shall be issued by the commissioner to any person who:  on the effective date of this act is, and for at least one year prior to the effective date of this act has been, serving as a fire inspector in the fire service;  or shall have, within two years of the effective date of this act, successfully completed an educational program such as the basic fire prevention code course offered by the Building Officials and Code Administrators International or a recognized equivalent, a fire prevention course offered by an institution of higher education or recognized fire school which has been approved by the commissioner. d.    In order to cover the cost to the municipality of providing insurance or other benefits provided to volunteer firefighters under N.J.S.40A:10-29 and N.J.S.40A:10-30, the municipality may, by ordinance, establish a surcharge for each inspection for which a fee is charged pursuant to subsection a. of this section.  Funds raised from the surcharge shall be paid into the treasury of the municipality to which the local enforcing agency is responsible. (cf: P.L.1983, c.383, s.12) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, designated as the "Assistance to Firefighters' Families Act," would double the survivor pension amounts that the State is required to pay to beneficiaries of volunteer firefighters, first aid workers, rescue squad workers, and emergency medical technicians who die as the result of injuries sustained while performing their duties. Additionally, this bill would require municipalities served by volunteer fire companies to pay reasonable funeral and burial expenses of an assured firefighter to the extent those costs are not covered by the New Jersey State Firemens Association or a firemens relief association.  The bill also increases from $25,000 to $250,000 the maximum group life insurance policy coverage that a municipality may undertake or pay the premium for.  Municipalities may raise funds to provide these benefits to volunteer firefighters by establishing a surcharge for each fire code inspection in the municipality.
