(2) inspect and review the operations, policies, procedures, and contracts of all juvenile detention centers or facilities, resource family homes, group homes, residential treatment facilities, shelters for care of abused or neglected children, homeless youth, or juveniles considered as juvenile-family crisis centers, or independent living arrangements operated, licensed, or approved for payment, by the Departments of Children and Families, Community Affairs, or Health, or any other public or private setting in which a child has been placed by a State or county agency or department;

and (2) the name of or any other information identifying the person who filed a complaint with, or otherwise provided information to, the office without the written consent of that person.  The information subject to the provisions of this subsection shall not be considered a public record pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) and P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5 et al.). c.  The ombudsman shall not disclose any information that may be deemed confidential by federal or State law, except when necessary to allow the Department of Children and Families, Attorney General, Juvenile Justice Commission, and other State or county department or agency to perform its duties and obligations under the law. 8.  Pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the Ombudsman for Children may adopt any rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act. 9.  This act shall take effect immediately.
