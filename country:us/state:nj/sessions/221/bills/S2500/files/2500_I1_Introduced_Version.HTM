and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.  There is established,
in but not of the Office of the Attorney General in the Department of Law and
Public Safety, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  For the purpose of
complying with the provisions of Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New
Jersey Constitution, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is hereby
allocated within the Office of the Attorney General, but notwithstanding this
allocation, the office shall be independent of any supervision or control by
the department or any board or officer thereof, or any other cabinet-level
department, board, or officer thereof.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of the office
shall be to ensure the provision of effective, appropriate, and timely services
for children at risk of abuse and neglect in the State, respond to the concerns
and addressing the needs of children in the resource family care, and that
children under State supervision due to child abuse or neglect are served
adequately and appropriately by the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The Governor shall appoint
an Ombudsman for Children who shall be qualified by training and experience to
perform the duties of the office.  The ombudsman shall be a person of
recognized judgment, integrity, and objectivity, and shall be skilled in
communication, conflict resolution, and professionalism.  The ombudsman shall
serve for a term of four years and until the appointment and qualification of
his successor.  A vacancy occurring in the position of the ombudsman shall be
filled in the same manner as the original appointment, except that if the ombudsman
dies, resigns, becomes ineligible to serve for any reason, or is removed from
office, the Governor shall appoint an acting ombudsman who shall serve until
the appointment and qualification of the ombudsman's successor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The ombudsman shall
organize and direct the work of the office, including the work of professional
and clerical staff, as may be necessary to carry out the ombudsman's duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  The Office of the
Ombudsman for Children shall be deemed a child protective agency for the
purposes of section 1 of P.L.1977, c.102 (C.9:6-8.10a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  Consistent with the
provisions of federal and State law the Ombudsman for Children shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  have access to, and the
right to inspect and copy, any records, relating to the care, custody, or
education of a child, necessary to carry out the responsibilities of the
ombudsman under this act; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  have reasonable access
to, and the right to copy any records from the Department of Children and
Families Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System, or its
successor, necessary to carry out its responsibilities under this act; except
that, access provided to the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information
System, or its successor, shall be limited to information available through the
system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The ombudsman may issue
subpoenas to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production
of books, papers, and other documents, and administer oaths to witnesses in any
matter under the investigation of the ombudsman.  If any person to whom such
subpoena is issued fails to appear or, having appeared, refuses to give
testimony, or fails to produce the books, papers, or other documents required,
the ombudsman may apply to the Superior Court, which may order the person to
appear and give testimony or produce the books, papers, or other documents, as
applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  The duties of the Ombudsman
for Children shall include, but shall not be limited to: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) identifying and reporting
on systemic issues and responses relating to the child welfare system,
including the States foster care system, upon which the Governor and
Legislature may act; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) ensuring compliance with
relevant statutes, rules, regulations, policies, and contracts concerning
facilities, services, and treatment of children under the jurisdiction of any
State agency or department providing services to children who are at risk of
abuse or neglect, children in State or institutional custody, children in
out-of-home placement, and children who receive child protective or permanency
services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) promoting public awareness
of the rights of, and providing information and outreach to, children in the
care and custody of the States child welfare and foster care system and their
families;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) disseminating information
to the public on the duties of the office, services the ombudsman provides, and
the methods by which the ombudsman may be contacted; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) aiding the Governor and
the Legislature in proposing methods of achieving increased coordination and
collaboration among State departments and agencies to ensure maximum effectiveness
and efficiency in the provision of services to children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The ombudsman shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) investigate, review, monitor,
or evaluate any State agency response to, or disposition of, an allegation of
child abuse or neglect in this State, or the out-of-placement of children under
the care, custody, and supervision of the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) inspect and review the
operations, policies, procedures, and contracts of all juvenile detention
centers or facilities, resource family homes, group homes, residential
treatment facilities, shelters for care of abused or neglected children,
homeless youth, or juveniles considered as juvenile-family crisis centers, or
independent living arrangements operated, licensed, or approved for payment, by
the Departments of Children and Families, Community Affairs, or Health, or any
other public or private setting in which a child has been placed by a State or
county agency or department;</p>

administrative proceedings before any department, commission, agency, or State
board, to assert the broad public interest of the State in the welfare of
children and to protect and promote the rights of children.  In taking such
actions, the ombudsman shall consider whether a child or family may be in need
of assistance from the ombudsman or whether there is a systemic issue in the
State's provision of services to children that should be addressed.  The ombudsman
shall make a good faith effort to resolve issues or problems, and shall have
the authority to commence negotiations, mediation, or alternative dispute
resolution in its advocacy efforts prior to, or in lieu of, the initiation of
any action brought pursuant to this section;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) conduct unannounced site
visits to any institution or facility to which children are committed or placed
if the ombudsman, prior to conducting an unannounced site visit, has initiated
a project or investigation into the response or disposition of an allegation of
abuse or neglect and there is a reasonable basis to believe that an unannounced
site visit is necessary to carry out the ombudsmans responsibilities under
this act, provided, however, that any unannounced site visit shall be conducted
at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) consult with any
appropriate State, county or municipal agency, or a State-funded private entity

authority provided in subsection b. of this section, the ombudsman shall have
discretion to decide whether to intervene in any particular matter or to

resources available, the importance and extent of the public interest involved,
and whether that interest would be adequately represented without the action of
the ombudsman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  a.  If the Ombudsman for
Children identifies a systemic problem in how the State, through its agencies
or contract services, protects children, the ombudsman shall meet with the
State agency or agencies with jurisdiction to provide a reasonable opportunity
to discuss the problem and identify possible responses the agency may
consider.  Taking into account any information provided during the meeting and
discussion, the ombudsman shall provide its findings and recommendations to the
agency affected by the findings and recommendations, and, except as provided in
subsections b. and c. of section 7 of this act, make those findings and
recommendations available to the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Within 45 days from the
receipt of the ombudsman's findings and recommendations, the agency shall
develop a corrective action plan that addresses the findings and recommendations
of the ombudsman and specifies what actions, if any, the agency will take in
response to the systemic problem identified by the ombudsman, which response
may be developed in conjunction with the ombudsman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The agency shall submit
its corrective action plan to the head of the relevant department or

the actions taken by the agency pursuant to its corrective action plan.  The ombudsman
shall monitor the agencys implementation of its corrective action response for
a period of one year, during which time the agency shall provide the ombudsman
with quarterly reports.  The agencys obligation to provide quarterly reports
on the implementation of its corrective action plan may exceed a period of one
year if the ombudsman and the agency jointly agree that an extended reporting
period is appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  If an agency fails to
