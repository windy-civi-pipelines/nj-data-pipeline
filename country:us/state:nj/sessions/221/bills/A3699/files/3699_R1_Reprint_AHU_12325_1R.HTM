Any health care provider who uses telemedicine or engages in telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices while providing health care services to a patient, shall:  (1) be validly licensed, certified, or registered, pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised Statutes, to provide such services in the State of New Jersey; (2) remain subject to regulation by the appropriate New Jersey State licensing board or other New Jersey State professional regulatory entity; (3) act in compliance with existing requirements regarding the maintenance of liability insurance; and (4) remain subject to New Jersey jurisdiction. c. (1) Telemedicine services may be provided using interactive, real-time, two-way communication technologies or, subject to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this paragraph, asynchronous store-and-forward technology. (2) A health care provider engaging in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices may use asynchronous store-and-forward technology to provide services with or without the use of interactive, real-time, two-way audio if, after accessing and reviewing the patient's medical records, the provider determines that the provider is able to meet the same standard of care as if the health care services were being provided in person and informs the patient of this determination at the outset of the telemedicine or telehealth encounter. (3) (a) At the time the patient requests health care services to be provided using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices, the patient shall be clearly advised that the telemedicine or telehealth encounter, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, may be with a health care provider who is not a physician, and that the patient may specifically request that the telemedicine or telehealth encounter be scheduled with a physician.  If the patient requests that the telemedicine or telehealth encounter, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, be with a physician, the encounter shall be scheduled with a physician. (b) The identity, professional credentials, and contact information of a health care provider providing telemedicine or telehealth services or using remote patient monitoring devices shall be made available to the patient at the time the patient schedules services to be provided using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices, if available, or upon confirmation of the scheduled telemedicine or telehealth encounter, which may include the use of remote patient monitoring devices, and shall be made available to the patient during and after the provision of services.  The contact information shall enable the patient to contact the health care provider, or a substitute health care provider authorized to act on behalf of the provider who provided services, for at least 72 hours following the provision of services.  If the health care provider is not a physician, and the patient requests that the services be provided by a physician, the health care provider shall assist the patient with scheduling a telemedicine or telehealth encounter, which may include the use of remote patient monitoring devices, with a physician. (4) A health care provider engaging in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices shall review the medical history and any medical records provided by the patient.  For an initial encounter with the patient, the provider shall review the patient's medical history and medical records prior to initiating contact with the patient, as required pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-63).  In the case of a subsequent telemedicine or telehealth encounter, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, conducted pursuant to an ongoing provider-patient relationship, the provider may review the information prior to initiating contact with the patient or contemporaneously with the telemedicine or telehealth encounter. (5) Following the provision of services using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices, the patient's medical information shall be entered into the patient's medical record, whether the medical record is a physical record, an electronic health record, or both, and, if so requested to by the patient, forwarded directly to the patient's primary care provider, health care provider of record or any other health care providers as may be specified by the patient.  For patients without a primary care provider or other health care provider of record, the health care provider engaging in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices may advise the patient to contact a primary care provider, and, upon request by the patient, shall assist the patient with locating a primary care provider or other in-person medical assistance that, to the extent possible, is located within reasonable proximity to the patient.  The health care provider engaging in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices shall also refer the patient to appropriate follow up care where necessary, including making appropriate referrals for in-person care or emergency or complementary care, if needed.  Consent may be oral, written, or digital in nature, provided that the chosen method of consent is deemed appropriate under the standard of care. d. (1) Any health care provider providing health care services using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices shall be subject to the same standard of care or practice standards as are applicable to in-person settings.  If telemedicine or telehealth services  or the use of remote patient monitoring devices would not be consistent with this standard of care, the health care provider shall direct the patient to seek in-person care. (2) Diagnosis, treatment, and consultation recommendations, including discussions regarding the risk and benefits of the patient's treatment options, which are made through the use of telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices, including the issuance of a prescription based on a telemedicine or telehealth encounter, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, shall be held to the same standard of care or practice standards as are applicable to in-person settings.  Unless the provider has established a proper provider-patient relationship with the patient, a provider shall not issue a prescription to a patient based solely on the responses provided in an online static questionnaire. (3) In the event that a mental health screener, screening service, or screening psychiatrist subject to the provisions of P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.1 et seq.) determines that an in-person psychiatric evaluation is necessary to meet standard of care requirements, or in the event that a patient requests an in-person psychiatric evaluation in lieu of a psychiatric evaluation performed using telemedicine or telehealth, the mental health screener, screening service, or screening psychiatrist may nevertheless perform a psychiatric evaluation using telemedicine and telehealth if it is determined that the patient cannot be scheduled for an in-person psychiatric evaluation within the next 24 hours.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a patient who receives a psychiatric evaluation using telemedicine and telehealth as provided in this paragraph from receiving a subsequent, in-person psychiatric evaluation in connection with the same treatment event, provided that the subsequent in-person psychiatric evaluation is necessary to meet standard of care requirements for that patient. e. The prescription of Schedule II controlled dangerous substances through the use of telemedicine or telehealth shall be authorized only after an initial in-person examination of the patient, as provided by regulation, and a subsequent in-person visit with the patient shall be required every three months for the duration of time that the patient is being prescribed the Schedule II controlled dangerous substance.  However, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply, and the in-person examination or review of a patient shall not be required, when a health care provider is prescribing a stimulant which is a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance for use by a minor patient under the age of 18, provided that the health care provider is using interactive, real-time, two-way audio and video technologies when treating the patient and the health care provider has first obtained written consent for the waiver of these in-person examination requirements from the minor patient's parent or guardian. f. A mental health screener, screening service, or screening psychiatrist subject to the provisions of P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.1 et seq.): (1) shall not be required to obtain a separate authorization in order to engage in telemedicine or telehealth for mental health screening purposes; and (2) shall not be required to request and obtain a waiver from existing regulations, prior to engaging in telemedicine or telehealth. g. A health care provider who engages in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices, as authorized by P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.), shall maintain a complete record of the patient's care, and shall comply with all applicable State and federal statutes and regulations for recordkeeping, confidentiality, and disclosure of the patient's medical record. h. A health care provider shall not be subject to any professional disciplinary action under Title 45 of the Revised Statutes solely on the basis that the provider engaged in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices pursuant to P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.). i. (1) In accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the State boards or other entities that, pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised Statutes, are responsible for the licensure, certification, or registration of health care providers in the State, shall each adopt rules and regulations that are applicable to the health care providers under their respective jurisdictions, as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section and facilitate the provision of telemedicine and telehealth services, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices.  Such rules and regulations shall, at a minimum: (a) include best practices for the professional engagement in telemedicine and telehealth and the use of remote patient monitoring devices; (b) ensure that the services patients receive using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices are appropriate, medically necessary, and meet current quality of care standards; (c) include measures to prevent fraud and abuse in connection with the use of telemedicine and telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices, including requirements concerning the filing of claims and maintaining appropriate records of services provided; and (d) provide substantially similar metrics for evaluating quality of care and patient outcomes in connection with services provided using telemedicine and telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices as currently apply to services provided in person. (2) In no case shall the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection require a provider to conduct an initial in-person visit with the patient as a condition of providing services using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices. (3) The failure of any licensing board to adopt rules and regulations pursuant to this subsection shall not have the effect of delaying the implementation of this act, and shall not prevent health care providers from engaging in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices in accordance with the provisions of this act and the practice act applicable to the provider's professional licensure, certification, or registration.1 (cf: P.L.2021, c.310, s.4) 16.  Section 3 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-63) is amended to read as follows: 3. a. Any health care provider who engages in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices shall ensure that a proper provider-patient relationship is established.  The establishment of a proper provider-patient relationship shall include, but shall not be limited to: (1)  properly identifying the patient using, at a minimum, the patient's name, date of birth, phone number, and address.  When properly identifying the patient, the provider may additionally use the patient's assigned identification number, social security number, photo, health insurance policy number, or other appropriate patient identifier associated directly with the patient; (2)  disclosing and validating the provider's identity and credentials, such as the provider's license, title, and, if applicable, specialty and board certifications; (3)  prior to initiating contact with a patient in an initial encounter for the purpose of providing services to the patient using telemedicine or telehealth, or remote patient monitoring devices, reviewing the patient's medical history and any available medical records; and (4)  prior to initiating contact with a patient for the purpose of providing services to the patient using telemedicine or telehealth, or remote patient monitoring devices, determining whether the provider will be able to provide the same standard of care using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices as would be provided if the services were provided in person.  The provider shall make this determination prior to each unique patient encounter. b. Telemedicine or telehealth may be practiced, or remote patient monitoring devices may be used, without a proper provider-patient relationship, as defined in subsection a. of this section, in the following circumstances: (1)  during informal consultations performed by a health care provider outside the context of a contractual relationship, or on an irregular or infrequent basis, without the expectation or exchange of direct or indirect compensation; (2)  during episodic consultations by a medical specialist located in another jurisdiction who provides consultation services, upon request, to a properly licensed or certified health care provider in this State; (3)  when a health care provider furnishes medical assistance in response to an emergency or disaster, provided that there is no charge for the medical assistance; or (4)  when a substitute health care provider, who is acting on behalf of an absent health care provider in the same specialty, provides health care services on an on-call or cross-coverage basis, provided that the absent health care provider has designated the substitute provider as an on-call provider or cross-coverage service provider.1 (cf: P.L.2017, c.117, s.3) 17.  Section 4 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-64) is amended to read as follows: 4. a.  Each telemedicine or telehealth organization operating in the State shall annually register with the Department of Health. b. Each telemedicine or telehealth organization operating in the State shall submit an annual report to the Department of Health in a manner as determined by the commissioner.  The annual report shall include de-identified encounter data including, but not limited to: the total number of telemedicine and telehealth encounters conducted; the type of technology utilized to provide services using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices; the category of medical condition for which services were sought; the geographic region of the patient and the provider; the patient's age and sex; and any prescriptions issued.  The commissioner may require the reporting of any additional information as the commissioner deems necessary and appropriate, subject to all applicable State and federal laws, rules, and regulations for recordkeeping and privacy.  Commencing six months after the effective date of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.), telemedicine and telehealth organizations shall include in the annual report, for each telemedicine or telehealth encounter: the patient's race and ethnicity; the diagnostic codes; the evaluation management codes; and the source of payment for the encounter. c. The Department of Health shall compile the information provided in the reports submitted by telemedicine and telehealth organizations pursuant to subsection b. of this section to generate Statewide data concerning telemedicine and telehealth services, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, provided in the State.  The department shall annually share the Statewide data with the Department of Human Services, the Department of Banking and Insurance, the Telemedicine and Telehealth Review Commission established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-65), State boards and other entities that, under Title 45 of the Revised Statutes, are responsible for the professional licensure, certification, or registration of health care providers in the State who provide health care services using telemedicine or telehealth or through the use of remote patient monitoring devices pursuant to P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.), and the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1).  The department shall also transmit a report to the Legislature and the Telemedicine and Telehealth Review Commission that includes: an analysis of each rule and regulation adopted pursuant to subsection i. of section 2 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-62) by a State board or other entity responsible for the professional licensure, certification, or registration of health care providers in the State who provide health care services using telemedicine or telehealth or through the use of remote patient monitoring devices; and an assessment of the effect that telemedicine and telehealth and the use of remote patient monitoring devices is having on health care delivery, health care outcomes, population health, and in-person health care services provided in facility-based and office-based settings. d.   A telemedicine or telehealth organization that fails to register with the Department of Health pursuant to subsection a. of this section or that fails to submit the annual report required pursuant to subsection b. of this section shall be liable to such disciplinary actions as the Commissioner of Health may prescribe by regulation.1 (cf: P.L.2017, c.117, s.4) 18.  Section 5 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-65) is amended to read as follows: 5. a.  Six months after the effective date of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.), there shall be established in the Department of Health the Telemedicine and Telehealth Review Commission, which shall review the information reported by telemedicine and telehealth organizations pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-64) and make recommendations for such executive, legislative, regulatory, administrative, and other actions as may be necessary and appropriate to promote and improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of telemedicine and telehealth services, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, provided in this State. b.

Any health care provider who uses telemedicine or engages in telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices while providing health care services to a patient, shall:  (1) be validly licensed, certified, or registered, pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised Statutes, to provide such services in the State of New Jersey; (2) remain subject to regulation by the appropriate New Jersey State licensing board or other New Jersey State professional regulatory entity; (3) act in compliance with existing requirements regarding the maintenance of liability insurance; and (4) remain subject to New Jersey jurisdiction. c. (1) Telemedicine services may be provided using interactive, real-time, two-way communication technologies or, subject to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this paragraph, asynchronous store-and-forward technology. (2) A health care provider engaging in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices may use asynchronous store-and-forward technology to provide services with or without the use of interactive, real-time, two-way audio if, after accessing and reviewing the patient's medical records, the provider determines that the provider is able to meet the same standard of care as if the health care services were being provided in person and informs the patient of this determination at the outset of the telemedicine or telehealth encounter. (3) (a) At the time the patient requests health care services to be provided using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices, the patient shall be clearly advised that the telemedicine or telehealth encounter, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, may be with a health care provider who is not a physician, and that the patient may specifically request that the telemedicine or telehealth encounter be scheduled with a physician.  If the patient requests that the telemedicine or telehealth encounter, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, be with a physician, the encounter shall be scheduled with a physician. (b) The identity, professional credentials, and contact information of a health care provider providing telemedicine or telehealth services or using remote patient monitoring devices shall be made available to the patient at the time the patient schedules services to be provided using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices, if available, or upon confirmation of the scheduled telemedicine or telehealth encounter, which may include the use of remote patient monitoring devices, and shall be made available to the patient during and after the provision of services.  The contact information shall enable the patient to contact the health care provider, or a substitute health care provider authorized to act on behalf of the provider who provided services, for at least 72 hours following the provision of services.  If the health care provider is not a physician, and the patient requests that the services be provided by a physician, the health care provider shall assist the patient with scheduling a telemedicine or telehealth encounter, which may include the use of remote patient monitoring devices, with a physician. (4) A health care provider engaging in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices shall review the medical history and any medical records provided by the patient.  For an initial encounter with the patient, the provider shall review the patient's medical history and medical records prior to initiating contact with the patient, as required pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-63).  In the case of a subsequent telemedicine or telehealth encounter, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, conducted pursuant to an ongoing provider-patient relationship, the provider may review the information prior to initiating contact with the patient or contemporaneously with the telemedicine or telehealth encounter. (5) Following the provision of services using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices, the patient's medical information shall be entered into the patient's medical record, whether the medical record is a physical record, an electronic health record, or both, and, if so requested to by the patient, forwarded directly to the patient's primary care provider, health care provider of record or any other health care providers as may be specified by the patient.  For patients without a primary care provider or other health care provider of record, the health care provider engaging in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices may advise the patient to contact a primary care provider, and, upon request by the patient, shall assist the patient with locating a primary care provider or other in-person medical assistance that, to the extent possible, is located within reasonable proximity to the patient.  The health care provider engaging in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices shall also refer the patient to appropriate follow up care where necessary, including making appropriate referrals for in-person care or emergency or complementary care, if needed.  Consent may be oral, written, or digital in nature, provided that the chosen method of consent is deemed appropriate under the standard of care. d. (1) Any health care provider providing health care services using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices shall be subject to the same standard of care or practice standards as are applicable to in-person settings.  If telemedicine or telehealth services  or the use of remote patient monitoring devices would not be consistent with this standard of care, the health care provider shall direct the patient to seek in-person care. (2) Diagnosis, treatment, and consultation recommendations, including discussions regarding the risk and benefits of the patient's treatment options, which are made through the use of telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices, including the issuance of a prescription based on a telemedicine or telehealth encounter, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, shall be held to the same standard of care or practice standards as are applicable to in-person settings.  Unless the provider has established a proper provider-patient relationship with the patient, a provider shall not issue a prescription to a patient based solely on the responses provided in an online static questionnaire. (3) In the event that a mental health screener, screening service, or screening psychiatrist subject to the provisions of P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.1 et seq.) determines that an in-person psychiatric evaluation is necessary to meet standard of care requirements, or in the event that a patient requests an in-person psychiatric evaluation in lieu of a psychiatric evaluation performed using telemedicine or telehealth, the mental health screener, screening service, or screening psychiatrist may nevertheless perform a psychiatric evaluation using telemedicine and telehealth if it is determined that the patient cannot be scheduled for an in-person psychiatric evaluation within the next 24 hours.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a patient who receives a psychiatric evaluation using telemedicine and telehealth as provided in this paragraph from receiving a subsequent, in-person psychiatric evaluation in connection with the same treatment event, provided that the subsequent in-person psychiatric evaluation is necessary to meet standard of care requirements for that patient. e. The prescription of Schedule II controlled dangerous substances through the use of telemedicine or telehealth shall be authorized only after an initial in-person examination of the patient, as provided by regulation, and a subsequent in-person visit with the patient shall be required every three months for the duration of time that the patient is being prescribed the Schedule II controlled dangerous substance.  However, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply, and the in-person examination or review of a patient shall not be required, when a health care provider is prescribing a stimulant which is a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance for use by a minor patient under the age of 18, provided that the health care provider is using interactive, real-time, two-way audio and video technologies when treating the patient and the health care provider has first obtained written consent for the waiver of these in-person examination requirements from the minor patient's parent or guardian. f. A mental health screener, screening service, or screening psychiatrist subject to the provisions of P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.1 et seq.): (1) shall not be required to obtain a separate authorization in order to engage in telemedicine or telehealth for mental health screening purposes; and (2) shall not be required to request and obtain a waiver from existing regulations, prior to engaging in telemedicine or telehealth. g. A health care provider who engages in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices, as authorized by P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.), shall maintain a complete record of the patient's care, and shall comply with all applicable State and federal statutes and regulations for recordkeeping, confidentiality, and disclosure of the patient's medical record. h. A health care provider shall not be subject to any professional disciplinary action under Title 45 of the Revised Statutes solely on the basis that the provider engaged in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices pursuant to P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.). i. (1) In accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the State boards or other entities that, pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised Statutes, are responsible for the licensure, certification, or registration of health care providers in the State, shall each adopt rules and regulations that are applicable to the health care providers under their respective jurisdictions, as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section and facilitate the provision of telemedicine and telehealth services, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices.  Such rules and regulations shall, at a minimum: (a) include best practices for the professional engagement in telemedicine and telehealth and the use of remote patient monitoring devices; (b) ensure that the services patients receive using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices are appropriate, medically necessary, and meet current quality of care standards; (c) include measures to prevent fraud and abuse in connection with the use of telemedicine and telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices, including requirements concerning the filing of claims and maintaining appropriate records of services provided; and (d) provide substantially similar metrics for evaluating quality of care and patient outcomes in connection with services provided using telemedicine and telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices as currently apply to services provided in person. (2) In no case shall the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection require a provider to conduct an initial in-person visit with the patient as a condition of providing services using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices. (3) The failure of any licensing board to adopt rules and regulations pursuant to this subsection shall not have the effect of delaying the implementation of this act, and shall not prevent health care providers from engaging in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices in accordance with the provisions of this act and the practice act applicable to the provider's professional licensure, certification, or registration.1 (cf: P.L.2021, c.310, s.4) 16.  Section 3 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-63) is amended to read as follows: 3. a. Any health care provider who engages in telemedicine or telehealth or the use of remote patient monitoring devices shall ensure that a proper provider-patient relationship is established.  The establishment of a proper provider-patient relationship shall include, but shall not be limited to: (1)  properly identifying the patient using, at a minimum, the patient's name, date of birth, phone number, and address.  When properly identifying the patient, the provider may additionally use the patient's assigned identification number, social security number, photo, health insurance policy number, or other appropriate patient identifier associated directly with the patient; (2)  disclosing and validating the provider's identity and credentials, such as the provider's license, title, and, if applicable, specialty and board certifications; (3)  prior to initiating contact with a patient in an initial encounter for the purpose of providing services to the patient using telemedicine or telehealth, or remote patient monitoring devices, reviewing the patient's medical history and any available medical records; and (4)  prior to initiating contact with a patient for the purpose of providing services to the patient using telemedicine or telehealth, or remote patient monitoring devices, determining whether the provider will be able to provide the same standard of care using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices as would be provided if the services were provided in person.  The provider shall make this determination prior to each unique patient encounter. b. Telemedicine or telehealth may be practiced, or remote patient monitoring devices may be used, without a proper provider-patient relationship, as defined in subsection a. of this section, in the following circumstances: (1)  during informal consultations performed by a health care provider outside the context of a contractual relationship, or on an irregular or infrequent basis, without the expectation or exchange of direct or indirect compensation; (2)  during episodic consultations by a medical specialist located in another jurisdiction who provides consultation services, upon request, to a properly licensed or certified health care provider in this State; (3)  when a health care provider furnishes medical assistance in response to an emergency or disaster, provided that there is no charge for the medical assistance; or (4)  when a substitute health care provider, who is acting on behalf of an absent health care provider in the same specialty, provides health care services on an on-call or cross-coverage basis, provided that the absent health care provider has designated the substitute provider as an on-call provider or cross-coverage service provider.1 (cf: P.L.2017, c.117, s.3) 17.  Section 4 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-64) is amended to read as follows: 4. a.  Each telemedicine or telehealth organization operating in the State shall annually register with the Department of Health. b. Each telemedicine or telehealth organization operating in the State shall submit an annual report to the Department of Health in a manner as determined by the commissioner.  The annual report shall include de-identified encounter data including, but not limited to: the total number of telemedicine and telehealth encounters conducted; the type of technology utilized to provide services using telemedicine or telehealth or remote patient monitoring devices; the category of medical condition for which services were sought; the geographic region of the patient and the provider; the patient's age and sex; and any prescriptions issued.  The commissioner may require the reporting of any additional information as the commissioner deems necessary and appropriate, subject to all applicable State and federal laws, rules, and regulations for recordkeeping and privacy.  Commencing six months after the effective date of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.), telemedicine and telehealth organizations shall include in the annual report, for each telemedicine or telehealth encounter: the patient's race and ethnicity; the diagnostic codes; the evaluation management codes; and the source of payment for the encounter. c. The Department of Health shall compile the information provided in the reports submitted by telemedicine and telehealth organizations pursuant to subsection b. of this section to generate Statewide data concerning telemedicine and telehealth services, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, provided in the State.  The department shall annually share the Statewide data with the Department of Human Services, the Department of Banking and Insurance, the Telemedicine and Telehealth Review Commission established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-65), State boards and other entities that, under Title 45 of the Revised Statutes, are responsible for the professional licensure, certification, or registration of health care providers in the State who provide health care services using telemedicine or telehealth or through the use of remote patient monitoring devices pursuant to P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.), and the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1).  The department shall also transmit a report to the Legislature and the Telemedicine and Telehealth Review Commission that includes: an analysis of each rule and regulation adopted pursuant to subsection i. of section 2 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-62) by a State board or other entity responsible for the professional licensure, certification, or registration of health care providers in the State who provide health care services using telemedicine or telehealth or through the use of remote patient monitoring devices; and an assessment of the effect that telemedicine and telehealth and the use of remote patient monitoring devices is having on health care delivery, health care outcomes, population health, and in-person health care services provided in facility-based and office-based settings. d.   A telemedicine or telehealth organization that fails to register with the Department of Health pursuant to subsection a. of this section or that fails to submit the annual report required pursuant to subsection b. of this section shall be liable to such disciplinary actions as the Commissioner of Health may prescribe by regulation.1 (cf: P.L.2017, c.117, s.4) 18.  Section 5 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-65) is amended to read as follows: 5. a.  Six months after the effective date of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.), there shall be established in the Department of Health the Telemedicine and Telehealth Review Commission, which shall review the information reported by telemedicine and telehealth organizations pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-64) and make recommendations for such executive, legislative, regulatory, administrative, and other actions as may be necessary and appropriate to promote and improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of telemedicine and telehealth services, including the use of remote patient monitoring devices, provided in this State. b. The commission shall consist of seven members, as follows: the Commissioner of Health, or a designee, who shall serve ex officio, and six public members, with two members each to be appointed by the Governor, the Senate President, and the Speaker of the General Assembly.  The public members shall be health care professionals with a background in the provision of health care services using telemedicine and telehealth.  The public members shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority, and vacancies in the membership shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointments. c. Members of the commission shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for necessary travel expenses incurred in the performance of their duties within the limits of funds made available for that purpose. d. The members shall select a chairperson and a vice chairperson from among the members.  The chairperson may appoint a secretary, who need not be a member of the commission.  The Department of Health shall provide staff and administrative support to the commission. e. The commission shall meet at least twice a year and at such other times as the chairperson may require.  The commission shall be entitled to call to its assistance and avail itself of the services of the employees of any State, county, or municipal department, board, bureau, commission, or agency as it may require and as may be available for its purposes. f.
