As an alternative to or in addition to any other sanctions provided by law for violations of the "New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law," P.L.1966, c.113 (C.34:11-56a et seq.), when the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development finds that an individual has violated [that act] P.L.1966, c.113 (C.34:11-56a et seq.), the commissioner is authorized to assess and collect administrative penalties, up to a maximum of $250 for a first violation and up to a maximum of $500 for each subsequent violation, specified in a schedule of penalties to be promulgated as a rule or regulation by the commissioner in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).

(cf: P.L.1991, c.205, s.5) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill revises certain penalties for violations of the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law, P.L.1966, c.113 (C.34:11-56a et seq.).  The bill provides that an employer who violates any provision of that law is, upon conviction of a first or second violation, guilty of a disorderly persons offense, and, upon conviction of a third or subsequent offense, guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. Current law states that for a first violation an employer is guilty of a disorderly persons offense and may be punished by a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not less than 10 and not more than 90 days or by both the fine and imprisonment. The bill increases the applicable fines for a first violation to not less than $500 and maintains the maximum fine of not more than $1,000.  Current law also states that for a second or subsequent violation an employer is guilty of a disorderly persons offense and may be punished by a fine of not less than $500 and not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not less than 10 and more than 100 days or by both the fine and imprisonment.  The bill increases the applicable fines for a second violation to not less than $1,000 and not more than $2,000.  Finally, the bill provides that a third or subsequent violation constitutes a crime of the fourth degree, punishable by a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 or by imprisonment for up to 18 months or by both the fine and imprisonment.
