Pursuant to Executive Order No. 8 of 2010, the Department of the Treasury is already required to publish certain State fiscal information in a format that is easily-understandable to the average taxpayer and allows opportunity to download and meaningfully compare data, available at http://www.yourmoney.nj.gov.  Evaluations of state transparency websites, such as the April 2018 Following the Money 2018 report compiled by the Frontier Group and U.S. PIRG Education Fund, highlight areas for improvement in the state provision of online access to governing spending data.  This bill is intended to implement recommendations contained in the report, in particular recommendations pertaining to the State government transparency website.
