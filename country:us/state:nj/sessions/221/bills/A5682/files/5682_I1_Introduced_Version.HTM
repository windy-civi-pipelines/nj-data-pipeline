an appropriation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 1 of P.L.2017,
c.90 (C.9:6-8.107) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  The Legislature finds and
declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  Child advocacy centers are
child-friendly centers where a multidisciplinary team of law enforcement, child
protective services, prosecutors, mental health and medical professionals, and
victim witness and family advocates can provide a coordinated response to the
investigation, treatment, prosecution, and prevention of child abuse and
neglect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Child advocacy centers and
multidisciplinary teams are designed to ease the stress experienced by
survivors of child abuse and neglect, and their families, throughout the
investigation process and improve methods of responding to acts of child abuse
and neglect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Child advocacy centers and
multidisciplinary teams reduce the trauma suffered by children who have been
abused or neglected by employing forensic interviewers specifically trained to
work with survivors of child abuse and neglect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  The centers and teams also
assist child abuse and neglect survivors and their families in obtaining
judicial, medical, therapeutic, and victim advocacy services, and enhance the
effectiveness of law enforcement, prosecutors, and child protective services
professionals when investigating child abuse and neglect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The number of child
advocacy centers in the United States has grown dramatically since 1986 when
the first center was established. According to the National Children's
Alliance, the national accrediting organization for child advocacy centers,
there are now more than <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>770<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>900</u>
centers nationwide <u>and 21 centers in New Jersey</u>, and, as of 2009, there
were over 900 multidisciplinary teams throughout the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  In order to ensure the
effective, efficient, and consistent delivery of services to the survivors of
child abuse and neglect and their families, it is necessary to establish <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>a
certification<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>an annual progress review</u> program for the State's child advocacy centers
and multidisciplinary teams <u>to qualify for available funding through the
provisions of P.L.2017, c.90 (C.9:6-8.107 et seq.)</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  Therefore, it is the
intent of the Legislature to create a <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>certification<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>an annual
progress review</u> program for the State's child advocacy centers and
multidisciplinary teams through the adoption and implementation of guidelines
of practice consistent with the accreditation standards developed by the
National Children's Alliance, or its successor.</p>

c.90 (C.9:6-8.108) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.  (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  The National Childrens
Alliance estimates that 25 percent of cases seen at child advocacy centers
involved a youth who either engaged in or was impacted by problematic sexual
behavior.  In New Jersey, regional diagnostic and treatment centers report this
represents between 15 and 30 percent of all cases treated by the centers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  In these cases, both the
youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behavior
require access to treatment and services to promote their healing and prevent
future problematic behaviors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  In February 2022, the
Problematic Sexual Behavior Workgroup was established in coordination with the
Department of Children and Families and various stakeholders including, but not
limited to, State governmental agencies, child advocacy centers, regional
diagnostic and treatment centers, law enforcement agencies, and victim advocacy
groups. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  The Workgroup was tasked with
creating a framework to address the need for youth involved in cases of
problematic sexual behavior to have access to appropriate medical and mental
health services by instituting a Statewide coordinated response to such cases. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  Over the course of a year,
the workgroup met regularly collecting research, speaking with other states,
conducting surveys of professionals involved in, and families impacted by,
problematic sexual behavior, and published a report describing the framework it
created for a Statewide response to cases involving problematic sexual
behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  The framework included
creating a problematic sexual behavior program to provide oversight of the
Statewide response to problematic sexual behavior cases and the establishment of
the Child Treatment Assistance Fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  The fund received an
initial $2.5 million from the Department of Children and Families to cover
medical and mental health expenses for youth referred to medical and mental
health services through the program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  Additional monies were
allocated to the fund through the States Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025 budgets to
support the creation of specialized positions throughout the State to provide
information on, and refer children and families to, available medical and mental
health services for youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic
sexual behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.  The framework created by
the workgroup also recommended: creating a screening and referral process by
which cases involving youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic
sexual behavior and their families; establishing a specialized assessment team
within the State Central Registry to refer youth who engage in or have been
impacted by problematic sexual behavior and their families to treatment and
other appropriate services; providing regular training in evidence-based
treatment and prevention modalities for mental health providers; and providing
training, support and technical assistance to the professionals and
stakeholders involved in the Statewide response to cases involving problematic
sexual behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j. Since the publication of
the Workgroups report, the Department of Children and Families and the Child
Advocacy Center-Multidisciplinary Team Advisory Board established pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.2107, c.90 (C.9:6-8.19) have worked to implement its
recommendations and institute a sustainable referral and treatment process for
youth who engage in or have been impacted by problematic sexual behaviors and
their families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.  Therefore, it is the
Legislatures intent to codify the efforts of the department and the board to
ensure that the framework created by the Problematic Sexual Behavior Workgroup
to treat and provide services to youth who engage in or have been impacted by
problematic sexual behavior and their families is permanently established in
law and supported by the current and all future administrations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>
