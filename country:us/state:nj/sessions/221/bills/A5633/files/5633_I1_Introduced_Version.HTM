<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes changes to the
process for filling vacancies in the nominations of political parties for
candidates for public office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows qualified
persons to submit their names for consideration to fill the vacancy, and ensures
that all qualified persons who have notified the appropriate political
committee or committees of their interest in being selected as a candidate for
the nomination for which there is a vacancy will be permitted to seek and
retain legal representation throughout the selection process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also extends the
timeframe for municipal clerks to certify to their respective county clerks an
official list of the duly elected county committee members and an official list
of the municipal committee chairs from 20 days after the meeting of each county
committee that is held on the first Tuesday following the primary election at
which committee members are elected.  Under the bill, the municipal clerks will
have 45 days following the meeting to certify the official list to the county
clerk.  This list is considered a government record accessible to the public,
and this bill would require that the list include accurate email addresses and
phone numbers for all committee members.  The bill further requires that the
list will be posted on the committees Internet website and that it be provided
to any person who has notified the committee of their interest in being
selected as a candidate for a vacancy in a nomination for public office upon
the committees receipt of such notification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires that a
final and complete list of qualified members be provided to each person who has
notified the committee of their interest in being selected as a candidate not
later than seven days prior to the committees vote to fill a vacancy.  Any
person being considered for selection as a candidate may object to the
qualifications of any member appearing on the final list, to the extent
permissible and in accordance with the applicable procedures, as established by
the committees bylaws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
meeting held to select a candidate to fill a vacancy in a nomination for public
office will be held in accordance with rules for conducting such a meeting as
established by the committees bylaws, and requires that such rules be provided
to any person who has notified the committee of their interest in being
selected to fill the vacancy not later than 24 hours prior to the vote.  Under
current law, the rules for conducting such vote to fill a vacancy may be
proposed by the chair of the meeting, at the meeting to fill the vacancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that the conduct of all contested votes to select a candidate for nomination
will be held in accordance with ethical standards that ensure the integrity of
the nomination process, as provided by the committee bylaws.</p>
