c.63 (C.40A:65-11), is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11.  a.  When a local unit
contracts, through a shared service or joint meeting, to have another local
unit or a joint meeting provide a service it is currently providing using
public employees and one or more of the local units have adopted Title 11A,
Civil Service, then the agreement shall include an employment reconciliation

Commission.  An employment reconciliation plan shall be subject to the
following provisions:</p>

service under the shared service agreement shall be given a terminal leave
payment of not less than a period of one month for each five-year period of
past service as an employee with the local unit, or other enhanced benefits
that may be provided or negotiated.  For the purposes of this paragraph,
&quot;terminal leave payment&quot; means a single, lump sum payment, paid at
termination, calculated using the regular base salary at the time of termination. 
Unless otherwise negotiated or provided by the employer, a terminal leave
benefit shall not include extended payment, or payment for retroactive salary
increases, bonuses, overtime, longevity, sick leave, accrued vacation or other
time benefit, or any other benefit.<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>

Commission shall place any employee that has permanent status pursuant to Title
11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes that is terminated for reasons
of economy or efficiency at any time by either local unit on a special
reemployment list for any civil service employer within the county of the
agreement or any political subdivision therein<u>, except that an </u></p>

proposed shared service agreement affects employees in local units subject to
Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes, an employment
reconciliation plan shall be filed with the Civil Service Commission prior to
the approval of the shared service agreement.  The commission shall review it
for consistency with this section within 45 days of receipt and it shall be
deemed approved, subject to approval of the shared service agreement by the end
of that time, unless the commission has responded with a denial or conditions
that must be met in order for it to be approved.<b><span style='font-family:

Commission shall create an implementation plan for the agreement that will: (1)
transfer employees with current status in current title unless reclassified, or
(2) reclassify employees into job titles that best reflect the work to be
performed.  The Civil Service Commission shall review whether any existing
hiring or promotional lists should be merged, inactivated, or re-announced. 
Non-transferred employees shall be removed or suspended only for good cause and

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the Local
Unit Alignment, Reorganization, and Consolidation Commission (LUARCC) examines
the consolidation of municipalities, the merger of autonomous agencies into their
parent municipal or county government, and the sharing of services between
municipalities or between municipalities and other public entities.  The bill
would clarify LUARCC's powers to recommend specific consolidations and mergers
under current law.  The bill would also clarify and enhance LUARCC's powers to
facilitate shared service agreements by authorizing LUARCC to recommend or to
order the execution of specific shared service agreements.  The provisions of
Title 11A, Civil Service, would not apply to an employee affected by a shared
services agreement ordered or recommended by LUARCC.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require LUARCC
to include in every consolidation proposal and every shared services proposal an
estimate of the savings that will result from implementation of the proposed
consolidation or sharing of services.  The bill allows local units to contest
LUARCC's estimate of savings by appeal to the Commissioner of Community
Affairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law provides for
public hearings when municipal consolidations are being considered.  The bill
provides that when a LUARCC recommends a municipal consolidation, the
commission must be present at one or more of those public hearings.  The bill
also requires LUARCC to hold at least two public hearings whenever the
commission recommends or orders a sharing of services. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, as under
current law, LUARCC-recommended consolidation or shared service proposals would
become effective upon adoption by a majority of the voters of each affected
municipality.  If the voters of a municipality do not approve a shared services
proposal or if a municipality or other entity identified in a proposed shared
services agreement does not enter into and implement the proposed shared
services agreement within 14 months following the effective date of the
proposal, the State would annually reduce that municipality's State aid by the amount
of savings that was estimated by LUARCC.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With regard to a
LUARCC-ordered sharing of services, if a municipality or other entity
identified in a shared services order does not implement the order within 14 months
of its effective date, the State would annually reduce the total amount of aid it
provides to that municipality or entity by the amount of savings that was estimated
by LUARCC.  Furthermore, the bill provides that under these circumstances the
State may take other steps it deems necessary to enforce the order, including
withholding all State aid allocated to that municipality or entity until it
complies with the order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
clarifies the Legislature's intention that LUARCC have sufficient resources to
fulfill its statutory obligations by empowering LUARCC to request specific
resources from the State and localities and to contract for necessary
services.  The bill would appropriate funds to LUARCC to cover the costs of
operations and to fund extraordinary expenses of local units needed to
implement a LUARCC-proposed consolidation plan or shared service agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
when local units enter into, renew, or extend shared service agreements or
joint meetings pursuant to the &quot;Uniform Shared Services and Consolidation
Act,&quot; P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A:65-1 et seq.) or any other law providing for
the sharing of services, the provisions of Title 11A, Civil Service, would not
apply to employees affected by the shared service agreement or joint contract.</p>
