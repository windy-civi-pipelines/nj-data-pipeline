This bill provides that, within 60 days of the bills effective date, each parolee who has been sentenced to life imprisonment and currently is serving a term of parole supervision is to be administratively reviewed for the purposes of determining whether the parolee should be discharged from parole if the parolee has served at least seven years of the parolees term of supervision and has been under advanced supervision status during the preceding two-year period.
