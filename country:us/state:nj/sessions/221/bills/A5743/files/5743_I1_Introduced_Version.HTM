criteria by which solar photovoltaic developments on roadside right-of-way
areas would be considered for the small solar facilities incentive program,
which would include the impact of the development on the traffic volume and
emissions burden of adjacent road systems.  Roadside right-of-way solar energy facilities
would be subject to the same qualification criteria as other solar facilities,

eligibility for net metering, incentives available to the project, and the rate
class of the facility. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      The 2019 Energy Master Plan
(EMP) found that the State could achieve its 100 percent clean energy and 80
percent greenhouse gas reduction goals with net savings and little added cost
when health benefits and climate change mitigation benefits are taken into
account, by maximizing the development of in-State renewable energy generation,
including 17,000 megawatts of solar energy by 2035 and 32 gigawatts by 2050.  Under
the least cost path identified by the EMP, solar energy could meet percent of
the States clean energy needs by 2050.  The EMP further determined that to
embark on this least cost path the State should add at least 400 megawatts of
in-State solar energy each year through 2030.  In 2021, Governor Murphy signed
Executive Order 274 (EO 274), establishing an interim greenhouse gas reduction
target of 50 percent by 2030.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Department of
Environmental Protections resultant Global Warming Reduction Act 80x50 report
analyzes New Jerseys emissions reductions to date, and presents strategies across
seven emissions sectors to ensure that the State achieves an 80 percent
emissions reduction by 2050.  The modeling performed in developing the 2019 EMP
shows that the least cost scenario can meet the 80x50 goal, as well as Governor
Murphys goal of 100 percent clean energy by 2050, in part by replacing fossil
fuels in the electric generation sector with renewable energy sources.  The
report indicates that wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies are
available at competitive prices, which can reduce electric generation sector
emissions and help meet increasing electricity demands across the State. </p>
