(cf: P.L.2009, c.188, s.3) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would eliminate certain bars to expungement of criminal records. Currently, N.J.S.2C:52-6 provides that a person can apply for expungement of an arrest or charge at any time following the disposition of proceedings in cases where the arrest or charge did not result in a conviction.  However, if the charges were dismissed pursuant to a program of supervisory treatment, conditional discharge, or conditional dismissal, the person must wait six months before applying for expungement of the arrest or charge.  This bill would eliminate the waiting period and allow the person to apply for expungement at any time following the disposition of proceedings. In addition, subsection f. of N.J.S.2C:52-14 bars expungement of a conviction if, prior to or subsequent to that conviction, criminal charges against the person were dismissed following completion of a supervisory treatment  or other diversion program. This bill would eliminate the bar on expungement under these circumstances and allow the person to petition the court for expungement of the conviction.
