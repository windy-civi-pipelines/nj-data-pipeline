(cf: P.L.2018, c.11, s.10) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would extend eligibility for rebates under the Homestead Property Tax Credit Act, P.L.1990, c.61, to State residents who make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) to a municipality for their homestead. Under the act, State residents with incomes not over $250,000 are eligible for a rebate or credit equal to a percentage of property taxes, or rent constituting property taxes, paid on their homestead, up to $10,000.  A resident is eligible for a rebate regardless of whether property taxes are paid directly to their municipality or indirectly through the payment of rent.  For purposes of determining the amount of the rebate for eligible tenants, the portion of rent that is deemed to constitute property taxes is 18 percent of rent paid during the tax year. The act defines property tax as payments made to a municipality based upon an ad valorem assessment of a parcel of real property, not including any PILOT payments made to a municipality.  An ad valorem assessment is an assessment based on a propertys fair market value. The bill would amend the definition of property tax under the Homestead Property Tax Credit Act to include PILOTs made to a municipality for an eligible homestead.  By making this change, the bill would allow State residents to qualify for a homestead rebate regardless of whether the resident pays property taxes based on an ad valorem assessment of their homestead or makes payments in lieu of property taxes.  Given that the Homestead Property Tax Credit Act currently serves as the basis under which Affordable New Jersey Communities for Homeowners and Renters Rebates, more commonly referred to as ANCHOR rebates, are authorized by the annual appropriations act, this bill would ensure that both types of taxpayer are eligible for these rebates each year.
