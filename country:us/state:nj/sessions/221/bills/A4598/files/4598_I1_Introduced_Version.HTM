A licensee or high-cost home loan counselor that fails to make and file its annual report in the form and within the time provided in this section shall be subject to a penalty of not more than $100 for each day's failure, and the commissioner may revoke or suspend its authority to do business in this State. The penalty may be collected in a summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.). A warrant may issue in lieu of a summons. e.     Each licensee shall have its financial records relating to debt adjustment audited annually by a certified public accountant or a public accountant, which audit shall be filed with the commissioner.

(cf: P.L.2007, c.81, s.25) 4.   Section 6 of P.L.1979, c.16 (C.17:16G-6) is amended to read as follows: 6.    a.   A licensee may charge a fee to cover the cost of providing debt adjustment and credit counseling. b.    The fee for debt adjustment for a nonprofit social service agency and a nonprofit consumer credit counseling agency shall not exceed 1% of the gross monthly income of the person to whom the service is rendered, but in no case more than $15.00 in any one month, except as may be otherwise provided by rule or regulation promulgated by the commissioner.  This fee may be waived in the discretion of the licensee. c.     The commissioner is authorized to establish the maximum fee that may be charged by a nonprofit social service agency and a nonprofit consumer credit counseling agency for credit counseling. d.    The commissioner is authorized to establish maximum fees that may be charged by for-profit debt adjusters for debt adjustment and credit counseling (cf: P.L.1986, c.184, s.4) 5.   (New section)  Every for-profit debt adjuster licensee shall, at the time an agreement is executed by a debtor, or as shortly thereafter as practical, distribute or otherwise make available to the debtor, in paper form or by electronic means if the debtor so agrees, a copy of the executed agreement.  The agreement shall disclose: a.   the services that the licensee will perform; b.   the methodology that the licensee will use to calculate fees to be charged for debt adjusting services and, if reasonably available at the time the agreement is executed, the fees that the licensee will charge; c.   the amount of time, estimated in good faith, to achieve the resolution of all enrolled debts; d.   to the extent that the debt adjusting service may include a resolution offer to any of the debtors creditors: (1)  the amount of money or the percentage of each outstanding debt that the debtor needs to accumulate before the licensee will make a bona fide resolution offer to each of the creditors; and (2)  the date, estimated in good faith, when the licensee will make a bona fide resolution offer to each of the creditors; e.   that debt adjusting may not be suitable for all individuals; f.    to the extent that any aspect of the debt adjusting service relies upon or results in the debtors failure to make timely payments to creditors, that the failure to pay ones debts will likely adversely affect the debtors creditworthiness, may result in the debtor being subject to collections efforts, including lawsuits by creditors, and may increase the amount of money the debtor owes due to the accrual of fees and interest; g.   that, unless the debtor is insolvent, if a creditor resolves a debt for less than its full amount, the resolution may result in the creation of taxable income to the debtor, even though the debtor does not receive any money; h.   that specific results cannot be predicted or guaranteed and the licensee cannot require a creditor to negotiate or resolve a debt; i.    that debt adjusting programs require that individuals meet regular savings goals in order to enable resolutions; j.    that the licensee: (1)  does not provide tax, accounting, or legal advice to individuals, unless the licensee is licensed to provide that advice; (2)  is the debtors advocate and does not receive compensation of any sort from creditors for providing debt adjusting services to the debtor; and (3)  does not make monthly or other payments to the debtors creditors; and k.    the list of debts covered by the agreement. 6.  (New section)  The provisions of P.L.1979, c.16 (C.17:16G-1 et seq.) that are applicable to for-profit debt adjusters are only applicable to the extent that they are not in conflict with the provisions of 16 C.F.R. 310.4 or any successor federal law or regulation. 7.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows certain for-profit debt adjustment companies to conduct business in the State.  A debt adjuster is a person or entity who: acts or offers to act for a consideration as an intermediary between a debtor and his creditors for the purpose of settling, compounding, or otherwise altering the terms of payment of any debts of the debtor; or receives money or other property from the debtor, or on behalf of the debtor, for payment to, or distribution among, the creditors of the debtor. Under New Jerseys current debt adjusters law, which is administered and enforced by the Department of Banking and Insurance, only nonprofit social service agencies and nonprofit consumer credit counseling agencies may operate debt adjustment services in the State. The bill would create an exception to the current law to allow for-profit debt adjustment companies to conduct business in the State provided the company (1) does not receive or hold, actually or constructively, consumer funds; and (2) is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to the commissions Telemarketing Sales Rule. The bill would generally subject for-profit debt adjuster companies to the same rules and restrictions as non-profit entities licensed to operate debt adjustment services, but with certain exceptions.  Under the bill, a for-profit debt adjuster would not be required to provide a certification about salaries and expenses as part of its annual audit.  The commissioner would be authorized to establish maximum fees that may be charged by for-profit debt adjusters.  The bill further provides that the provisions of the debt adjuster act are only applicable to for-profit debt adjusters to the extent that they do not conflict with the federal Telemarketing Sales Rule. The bill would provide that for-profit debt adjusters are not subject to the bonding requirements that apply to nonprofit social service agencies and nonprofit consumer credit counseling agencies that perform debt adjuster services in the State. The bill also requires for-profit debt adjuster licensees that enter into an agreement with a debtor to disclose certain information to the debtor. Lastly, the bill clarifies language about persons engaged in the practice of law that are not deemed to be debt adjusters.
