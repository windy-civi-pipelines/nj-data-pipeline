STATEMENT This bill limits speculative development of warehouses until the State Agriculture Development Committee (SADC) catalogs 500,000 acres of preserved farmland under farmland preservation programs (programs).  An application for the speculative development of a warehouse on active farmland may be considered by an approving authority if the applicant commits to the approving authority and to the SADC to preserve an area of farmland in the State equal in size to the number of acres proposed for development in the application.  The SADC is to report to the Governor and to the Legislature when the SADC catalogs 500,000 acres of preserved farmland under these programs.  The bill is to expire upon the submission of that report. In 1998, the Governors Council on New Jersey Outdoors issued a report recommending that at least 500,000 acres of farmland should be preserved to maintain a critical mass of land for agricultural production and to assure the future success of farming in this State.  As of January 9, 2023, the SADC has accounted for 248,009 acres of preserved farmland under these programs.
