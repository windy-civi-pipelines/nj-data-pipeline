AJR207 ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION No. 207 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED DECEMBER 12, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ANDREA KATZ District 8 (Atlantic and Burlington) SYNOPSIS Urges Congress to call constitutional convention to consider reproductive health care rights. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution urging Congress to convene to consider a constitutional amendment to protect certain reproductive health care rights. Whereas, Following the United States Supreme Courts 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Org., which overturned Roe v. Wade and decisions concerning abortion and reproductive health rights have largely become the purview of the states and no longer a fundamental right of the individual; and Whereas, This decision created a disparity for individuals, based on where they lived, in accessing essential reproductive health services; and Whereas, A constitutional amendment providing citizens of the United States with fundamental reproductive health care rights would establish a clear, nationwide standard for reproductive health rights, preventing a patchwork of laws where rights vary significantly state by state; and Whereas, Under the United States Constitution, the United States Congress may submit a proposed constitutional amendment to the states if the proposed language is approved by a two-thirds vote of both Houses; and Whereas, In addition to constitutional amendments proposed by Congress, states may petition Congress to call a constitutional convention upon agreement of two-thirds of states; and Whereas, Constitutional amendments proposed by Congress or convention become valid only when ratified by the legislatures of, or conventions in, three-fourths of the states; and Whereas, As stated by United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen: eliminating the rights of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades; and Whereas, Such constitutional amendment reaffirms the United States commitment to human rights by promoting individual freedoms and gender equality; and Whereas, A constitutional amendment may also help reduce disparities in access to reproductive health care, particularly for marginalized communities, including low-income individuals and people of color; and Whereas, New Jersey is a state that supports and provides protections for the reproductive freedom of its citizens, including the right to make the personal choice of whether to start or expand a family through in-vitro fertilization (IVF); and Whereas, It is in the public interest of the citizens of the State and this nation to condemn, in the strongest terms, any action that infringes on citizens rights to exercise their reproductive freedom or their ability to access reproductive health care, including IVF; and Whereas, The United States Congress has the ability to start the process of amending the Constitution to provide Americans reproductive health rights and freedoms and should do so; now, therefore Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This joint resolution urges the United States Congress to convene a constitutional convention to consider amending the federal Constitution to provide every person in this country the fundamental right to choose or refuse contraception or sterilization, and choose whether to carry a pregnancy, to give birth, or to terminate a pregnancy. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the General Assembly to each member elected from this State to the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution urges the United States Congress to call a Constitutional convention.  Such a convention would consider amending the constitution to provide for reproductive health rights for all Americans, including the right to access contraception, to terminate a pregnancy, and to carry a pregnancy to term. A constitutional amendment proposed by Congress through a constitutional convention, and ratified by three-fourths of the states, will ensure that all individuals, regardless of where they live, have access to essential reproductive health services.
