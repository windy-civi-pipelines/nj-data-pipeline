<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, titled the New
Jersey Design Professional Self-Certification Act, would establish a program
through which architects and engineers, who become certified as qualified
design professionals, could:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   take responsibility for
the construction code compliance of certain construction projects, and</p>

construction permit application and accompanying documents comply with the
State Uniform Construction Code and the requirements of other applicable laws. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Property owners would have the
option of hiring a qualified design professional in order to take advantage of
this self-certification program, or submitting their applications for building
permits through the current approval process.  Current law requires a local
enforcing agency to grant, in whole or in part, or deny an application for a
construction permit within 20 business days.  Under the bill, the Department of
Community Affairs would accept a permit application and accompanying documents
that are self-certified by a qualified design professional and, after a
supervisory check, issue a permit within one to five calendar days, depending
on the scope of the project.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the Commissioner
of Community Affairs to establish requirements for design professionals to

successful completion of a course of instruction.  The bill authorizes the commissioner
to exclude certain classes or types of occupancy posing special or unusual
hazards to public safety from the self-certification program.</p>
