An applicant who the commissioner finds is qualified to resume participation in the program shall be on probation for a period of not less than six months after reinstatement and during that time, as a condition of such reinstatement, shall attend one or more training or continuing education courses approved by the department and related to compliance with the construction code and related laws and rules. The design professional shall submit satisfactory proof of the successful completion of such training or continuing education courses to the department. d.    The commissioner shall revoke, for a period of not less than five years, the self-certification privileges of a qualified design professional who, while on probation, professionally certifies an application, plans, construction documents, or other document that contains materially false information or is not in material compliance with all applicable provisions of law, or who otherwise demonstrates gross incompetence or a total disregard of the applicable laws or standards. e.     Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the commissioner's power to adopt rules that include additional grounds to limit the self-certification privileges of, or otherwise sanction, a qualified design professional, after affording the professional an opportunity for a hearing, when the commissioner determines that the design professional knowingly or negligently submitted permit applications or other documents to the department that contain materially false information or are not in material compliance with all applicable provisions of law or that otherwise demonstrate incompetence or a total disregard of applicable law or standards. f.     The department shall create and maintain a searchable database on its Internet website of all qualified design professionals who have been excluded, suspended or otherwise sanctioned by the department. Within seven business days of the date a sanction is imposed, the department shall post on its website and shall make available upon request, the name of the qualified design professional, a description of the sanction, the initial date of the sanction, the reinstatement date, if applicable, the address of the premises for which the application associated with the sanction was submitted, and whether the sanction was imposed after a hearing or through a settlement. The department shall provide requested information concerning the exclusion, suspension, or other sanction of a specific qualified design professional within 30 days of such request. g.    The department shall provide written notice to the State Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors of any professional engineer who was the subject of any disciplinary proceeding as a qualified design professional when there has been an adverse determination or sanction by the department, including any settlement agreement that is reached between the parties that resulted in a sanction of loss of privileges being imposed by the department. Such notice shall be sent within 10 business days after a determination is made in any such disciplinary proceeding or after a settlement of such proceeding has been reached, and shall include the name, and business firm name and address of such professional engineer, as well as any supporting documentation for the sanction imposed. h.    The department shall provide written notice to the New Jersey State Board of Architects of any registered architect who was the subject of any disciplinary proceeding as a qualified design professional when there has been an adverse determination or sanction by the department including any settlement agreement that is reached between the parties that resulted in a sanction of loss of privileges being imposed by the department. Such notice shall be sent within 10 business days after a determination is made in any such disciplinary proceeding or after a settlement of such proceeding has been reached, and shall include the name, and business firm name and address of such registered architect, as well as any supporting documentation for the sanction imposed. i.     The department shall not provide notice pursuant to subsections f., g., or h. of this section until a design professionals rights to appeal are exhausted or have expired. 10.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, however the commissioner may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance as may be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill, titled the New Jersey Design Professional Self-Certification Act, would establish a program through which architects and engineers, who become certified as qualified design professionals, could: (1)   take responsibility for the construction code compliance of certain construction projects, and (2)   self-certify that the construction permit application and accompanying documents comply with the State Uniform Construction Code and the requirements of other applicable laws. Property owners would have the option of hiring a qualified design professional in order to take advantage of this self-certification program, or submitting their applications for building permits through the current approval process.  Current law requires a local enforcing agency to grant, in whole or in part, or deny an application for a construction permit within 20 business days.  Under the bill, the Department of Community Affairs would accept a permit application and accompanying documents that are self-certified by a qualified design professional and, after a supervisory check, issue a permit within one to five calendar days, depending on the scope of the project. The bill directs the Commissioner of Community Affairs to establish requirements for design professionals to qualify to participate in the self-certification program, which would include successful completion of a course of instruction.  The bill authorizes the commissioner to exclude certain classes or types of occupancy posing special or unusual hazards to public safety from the self-certification program. The bill provides that for each project, the qualified design professional of record must furnish to the department a certificate of professional liability insurance with limits of no less than $500,000 per claim and $1,000,000 in the aggregate, and a Professional of Record Self-Certification Statement. For each project, the qualified design professional of record must submit to the department an Owner Certification Statement and an Owner Hold Harmless Letter, both of which must be signed and dated by the owner.  The Owner Certification Statement certifies that the owner · authorized the work identified in the permit application and accompanying plans, · will take all measures necessary to correct any false facts stated in the permit application, · understands that the project is being approved for a building permit subject to audit or field inspection by the department, and · if necessary, will bring the plans and all construction completed under the permit into conformity with requirements of the construction code and other applicable laws. In the Owner Hold Harmless Letter, the owner agrees to: · protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the municipality and the State of New Jersey against claims connected with the self-certified project, and · remove or modify, at the owners own expense, any component of construction found to not conform to the construction code or any other applicable law or to any permit issued under the self-certification program. Self-certified projects would be subject to random audit by the department to determine whether the plans and projects comply with the requirements of the State Uniform Construction Code and other applicable laws. The bill directs the department to design and implement audits to measure the efficiency of the self-certification program. The bill empowers the commissioner to exclude, suspend or otherwise sanction a qualified design professional for cause.

An applicant who the commissioner finds is qualified to resume participation in the program shall be on probation for a period of not less than six months after reinstatement and during that time, as a condition of such reinstatement, shall attend one or more training or continuing education courses approved by the department and related to compliance with the construction code and related laws and rules. The design professional shall submit satisfactory proof of the successful completion of such training or continuing education courses to the department. d.    The commissioner shall revoke, for a period of not less than five years, the self-certification privileges of a qualified design professional who, while on probation, professionally certifies an application, plans, construction documents, or other document that contains materially false information or is not in material compliance with all applicable provisions of law, or who otherwise demonstrates gross incompetence or a total disregard of the applicable laws or standards. e.     Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the commissioner's power to adopt rules that include additional grounds to limit the self-certification privileges of, or otherwise sanction, a qualified design professional, after affording the professional an opportunity for a hearing, when the commissioner determines that the design professional knowingly or negligently submitted permit applications or other documents to the department that contain materially false information or are not in material compliance with all applicable provisions of law or that otherwise demonstrate incompetence or a total disregard of applicable law or standards. f.     The department shall create and maintain a searchable database on its Internet website of all qualified design professionals who have been excluded, suspended or otherwise sanctioned by the department. Within seven business days of the date a sanction is imposed, the department shall post on its website and shall make available upon request, the name of the qualified design professional, a description of the sanction, the initial date of the sanction, the reinstatement date, if applicable, the address of the premises for which the application associated with the sanction was submitted, and whether the sanction was imposed after a hearing or through a settlement. The department shall provide requested information concerning the exclusion, suspension, or other sanction of a specific qualified design professional within 30 days of such request. g.    The department shall provide written notice to the State Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors of any professional engineer who was the subject of any disciplinary proceeding as a qualified design professional when there has been an adverse determination or sanction by the department, including any settlement agreement that is reached between the parties that resulted in a sanction of loss of privileges being imposed by the department. Such notice shall be sent within 10 business days after a determination is made in any such disciplinary proceeding or after a settlement of such proceeding has been reached, and shall include the name, and business firm name and address of such professional engineer, as well as any supporting documentation for the sanction imposed. h.    The department shall provide written notice to the New Jersey State Board of Architects of any registered architect who was the subject of any disciplinary proceeding as a qualified design professional when there has been an adverse determination or sanction by the department including any settlement agreement that is reached between the parties that resulted in a sanction of loss of privileges being imposed by the department. Such notice shall be sent within 10 business days after a determination is made in any such disciplinary proceeding or after a settlement of such proceeding has been reached, and shall include the name, and business firm name and address of such registered architect, as well as any supporting documentation for the sanction imposed. i.     The department shall not provide notice pursuant to subsections f., g., or h. of this section until a design professionals rights to appeal are exhausted or have expired. 10.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, however the commissioner may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance as may be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill, titled the New Jersey Design Professional Self-Certification Act, would establish a program through which architects and engineers, who become certified as qualified design professionals, could: (1)   take responsibility for the construction code compliance of certain construction projects, and (2)   self-certify that the construction permit application and accompanying documents comply with the State Uniform Construction Code and the requirements of other applicable laws. Property owners would have the option of hiring a qualified design professional in order to take advantage of this self-certification program, or submitting their applications for building permits through the current approval process.  Current law requires a local enforcing agency to grant, in whole or in part, or deny an application for a construction permit within 20 business days.  Under the bill, the Department of Community Affairs would accept a permit application and accompanying documents that are self-certified by a qualified design professional and, after a supervisory check, issue a permit within one to five calendar days, depending on the scope of the project. The bill directs the Commissioner of Community Affairs to establish requirements for design professionals to qualify to participate in the self-certification program, which would include successful completion of a course of instruction.  The bill authorizes the commissioner to exclude certain classes or types of occupancy posing special or unusual hazards to public safety from the self-certification program. The bill provides that for each project, the qualified design professional of record must furnish to the department a certificate of professional liability insurance with limits of no less than $500,000 per claim and $1,000,000 in the aggregate, and a Professional of Record Self-Certification Statement. For each project, the qualified design professional of record must submit to the department an Owner Certification Statement and an Owner Hold Harmless Letter, both of which must be signed and dated by the owner.  The Owner Certification Statement certifies that the owner · authorized the work identified in the permit application and accompanying plans, · will take all measures necessary to correct any false facts stated in the permit application, · understands that the project is being approved for a building permit subject to audit or field inspection by the department, and · if necessary, will bring the plans and all construction completed under the permit into conformity with requirements of the construction code and other applicable laws. In the Owner Hold Harmless Letter, the owner agrees to: · protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the municipality and the State of New Jersey against claims connected with the self-certified project, and · remove or modify, at the owners own expense, any component of construction found to not conform to the construction code or any other applicable law or to any permit issued under the self-certification program. Self-certified projects would be subject to random audit by the department to determine whether the plans and projects comply with the requirements of the State Uniform Construction Code and other applicable laws. The bill directs the department to design and implement audits to measure the efficiency of the self-certification program. The bill empowers the commissioner to exclude, suspend or otherwise sanction a qualified design professional for cause.
