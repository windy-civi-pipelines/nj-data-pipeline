STATEMENT This bill includes self-insured entities and plans under certain provisions of the "New Jersey Insurance Fraud Prevention Act."  Specifically, the bill provides that persons or practitioners violate that act if they: (1)   Present or cause to be presented any written or oral statement as part of, or in support of or opposition to, a claim for payment or other benefit pursuant to a self-insured plan, knowing that the statement contains any false or misleading information concerning any fact or thing material to the claim; (2)   Prepare or make any written or oral statement that is intended to be presented to a self-insured entity, or in support of or opposition to any claim for payment or other benefit to a self-insured plan, knowing that the statement contains false or misleading information concerning anything material to the claim; or (3)   Conceal or knowingly fail to disclose the occurrence of an event which affects any person's initial or continued right or entitlement to any benefit or payment under a self-insured plan. Under the bill, a self-insured entity is a public or private entity that retains the risk and responsibility for paying for losses from contingent events for beneficiaries of its self-insured plan, in accordance with the terms of its self-insured plan, from its own funds or from its own funds together with funds contributed by or on behalf of the beneficiaries of the self-insured plan.  A self-insured plan is any plan of benefits for losses incurred from contingent events, which may include health, bodily injury, property damage, liability, disability, life, workers compensation or other benefits not prohibited by law, offered by a self-insured entity to its employees, members, officers, owners or other persons entitled to benefits under the terms of the self-insured plan. The bill provides that self-insured entities damaged as the result of a violation of any provision of the "New Jersey Insurance Fraud Prevention Act" may bring suit in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover compensatory damages. The bill provides that the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance may make relevant papers, documents, reports, or evidence available to a self-insured entity injured by a violation of the "New Jersey Insurance Fraud Prevention Act" consistent with the purposes of that act and under such conditions as the commissioner deems appropriate.
