district would only be allowed to provide additional compensation for education

school districts to report the number of teachers in each school who received a
rating of ineffective, partially effective, effective, and highly effective on
the annual summative evaluation.  The Commissioner of Education will provide a
similar report for teachers, principals, assistant principals, and
