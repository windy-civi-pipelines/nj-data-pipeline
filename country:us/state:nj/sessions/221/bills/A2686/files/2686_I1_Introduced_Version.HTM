Any military or naval service shall be credited towards this employment or seniority credit including service that occurred prior to the member's employment as a teaching staff member. (cf: P.L.1991, c.389, s.2) 18.  N.J.S.18A:28-12 is amended to read as follows: 18A:28-12.    If any teaching staff member in a position other than teacher, principal, assistant principal, and vice-principal shall be dismissed as a result of such reduction, such person shall be and remain upon a preferred eligible list in the order of seniority for reemployment whenever a vacancy occurs in a position for which such person shall be qualified and he shall be reemployed by the body causing dismissal, if and when such vacancy occurs and in determining seniority, and in computing length of service for reemployment, full recognition shall be given to previous years of service, and the time of service by any such person in or with the military or naval forces of the United States or of this State, subsequent to September 1, 1940, and the time of service of any member of the American Merchant Marine during World War II who is declared by the United States Department of Defense to be eligible for federal veterans' benefits, shall be credited to him as though he had been regularly employed in such a position within the district during the time of such military or naval service, except that the period of that service shall not be credited toward more than four years of employment or seniority credit. (cf: P.L.1991, c.389, s.3) 19.  Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the Commissioner of Education shall adopt, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, such rules and regulations as the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.   (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) which shall be effective for a period not to exceed 12 months.  The regulations shall thereafter be amended, adopted, or readopted by the State Board of Education in accordance with the provisions of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 20.  The following sections are repealed: Section 5 of P.L.1995, c.294 (C.18A:6-31.7); N.J.S.18A:8-34; N.J.S.18A:13-42; Section 1 of P.L.1972, c.64 (C.18A:29-4.2). 21.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The bill requires school districts to adopt a salary schedule or compensation policy for all teachers, principals, assistant principals, and vice-principals that is consistent with regulations promulgated in accordance with the provisions of the bill.  The regulations will establish the individuals annual evaluation, assignment to a failing school, and teaching in a difficult to staff subject area as the primary factors that determine an individuals compensation, and years of experience cannot be a primary determinant of an individuals compensation.  A district would only be allowed to provide additional compensation for education attainment if the commissioner has determined that the additional education will have a positive effect on student achievement and the teaching staff member is teaching or practicing in the subject area in which the additional academic credit or degree was attained. The bill stipulates that a teacher will not be assigned to the instructional staff of a school without the consent of the principal of the school.  If a principal does not consent to the assignment of a teacher who is under tenure, the teacher may continue to receive compensation as the teacher and district seek to identify a principal who will consent to the placement.  If such as placement is not found after 12 months, the teacher may be placed on permanent unpaid leave. The bill also requires that, in the case of a teacher, principal, assistant principal, or vice-principal, any dismissals resulting from a reduction in force must be made on the basis of effectiveness as determined by the evaluation system established under P.L.2012, c.26, rather than based on seniority.  Last, the bill requires school districts to report the number of teachers in each school who received a rating of ineffective, partially effective, effective, and highly effective on the annual summative evaluation.  The Commissioner of Education will provide a similar report for teachers, principals, assistant principals, and vice-principals in each school district.

(cf: P.L.1991, c.389, s.3) 19.  Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the Commissioner of Education shall adopt, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, such rules and regulations as the commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.   (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) which shall be effective for a period not to exceed 12 months.  The regulations shall thereafter be amended, adopted, or readopted by the State Board of Education in accordance with the provisions of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 20.  The following sections are repealed: Section 5 of P.L.1995, c.294 (C.18A:6-31.7); N.J.S.18A:8-34; N.J.S.18A:13-42; Section 1 of P.L.1972, c.64 (C.18A:29-4.2). 21.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The bill requires school districts to adopt a salary schedule or compensation policy for all teachers, principals, assistant principals, and vice-principals that is consistent with regulations promulgated in accordance with the provisions of the bill.  The regulations will establish the individuals annual evaluation, assignment to a failing school, and teaching in a difficult to staff subject area as the primary factors that determine an individuals compensation, and years of experience cannot be a primary determinant of an individuals compensation.  A district would only be allowed to provide additional compensation for education attainment if the commissioner has determined that the additional education will have a positive effect on student achievement and the teaching staff member is teaching or practicing in the subject area in which the additional academic credit or degree was attained. The bill stipulates that a teacher will not be assigned to the instructional staff of a school without the consent of the principal of the school.  If a principal does not consent to the assignment of a teacher who is under tenure, the teacher may continue to receive compensation as the teacher and district seek to identify a principal who will consent to the placement.  If such as placement is not found after 12 months, the teacher may be placed on permanent unpaid leave. The bill also requires that, in the case of a teacher, principal, assistant principal, or vice-principal, any dismissals resulting from a reduction in force must be made on the basis of effectiveness as determined by the evaluation system established under P.L.2012, c.26, rather than based on seniority.  Last, the bill requires school districts to report the number of teachers in each school who received a rating of ineffective, partially effective, effective, and highly effective on the annual summative evaluation.  The Commissioner of Education will provide a similar report for teachers, principals, assistant principals, and vice-principals in each school district.
