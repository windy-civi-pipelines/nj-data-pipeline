(cf: P.L.2015, c.82, s.1) 3.    Section 9 of P.L.2000, c.58 (C.30:4C-15.10), is amended to read as follows: 9.    a.      The Commissioner of Children and Families, in consultation with the Commissioner of Health [and Senior Services] and pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of [this act] P.L.2000, c.58 (C.30:4C-15.5 et al.). b.    On or before the first day of the third month next following enactment, the Commissioner of Community Affairs, in consultation with the Commissioner of Children and Families and the Commissioner of Health, and pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall adopt rules and regulations to guide the installation, maintenance, and proper activation, of newborn safety devices installed in accordance with section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The commissioners rules and regulations shall designate the buildings, if any, in addition to police stations, fire stations, and hospitals, in which the placement of a newborn safety device is appropriate, and the designation shall thereby entitle the parent to an affirmative defense to prosecution for abandonment of a child, pursuant to subsection e. of section 4 of P.L.2000, c.58 (C.30:4C-15.7), if a newborn is placed in a newborn safety device.  The commissioners rules and regulations shall also designate the range of features that shall be included in the device to ensure compliance with P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2006, c.47, s.126) 4.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, and shall apply to a construction permit not yet declared complete by the enforcing agency prior to that date. STATEMENT This bill requires newly constructed police stations, fire stations, and hospitals to contain a newborn safety device and allows an affirmative defense to prosecution for abandonment of a child if a parent leaves a child in this device. As used in the bill, newborn safety device refers to a secure compartment, with a functioning alarm, intended for the safe placement of a newborn child, and installed and maintained at a fire station, police station, hospital, or other appropriate facility, in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Community Affairs. Specifically, the bill requires a newly constructed building to provide a newborn safety device if the building is intended to serve as: (1) a State, county, or municipal police station; (2) a fire station of a municipal, county, fire district, or volunteer fire department; or (3) a licensed general hospital, or an emergency department thereof. Further, under current law, it is an affirmative defense to prosecution for the abandonment of a child if the parent leaves a newborn with an adult employee of a police station, fire station, or hospital.  This bill would offer a parent the equivalent affirmative defense if the parent leaves the child in a newborn safety device at a police station, fire station, hospital, or other appropriate facility. Current law provides for the Division of Child Protection and Permanency to assume responsibility for the care, custody, and control of a baby abandoned by a parent.  The bill removes a requirement that the facility be staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week in order to qualify for the affirmative defense, so long as the infant is left either with an adult employee, or in a newborn safety device. Finally, the bill directs the Commissioner of Community Affairs to promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of this bill.  These rules and regulations would include designation of what buildings, if any, in addition to police stations, fire stations, and hospitals, are appropriate for the placement of a newborn safety device, thereby entitling the parent to an affirmative defense to prosecution for abandonment of a child, if a newborn is placed in a newborn safety device. The rules and regulations would also designate what range of features are necessary to include in the device to ensure compliance with the bill.
