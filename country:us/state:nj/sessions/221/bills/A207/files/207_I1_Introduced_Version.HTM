time shorter than the standard period of the license, the commission shall fix
the expiration date of the license at a date based on the period in which the
person is authorized to be present in the United States under federal immigration

licensed to drive a passenger automobile for not less than three years. The holder
of an examination permit who is at least 21 years of age shall operate the

shall operate the passenger automobile with only one additional passenger in
the vehicle excluding dependents of the permit holder, except that this
passenger restriction shall not apply when the permit holder is at least 21
years of age or when the permit holder is accompanied by a parent or guardian. 
Further, the holder of the passenger automobile permit who is less than 21 years
of age shall not drive during the hours between 11:01 p.m. and 5 a.m.;
provided, however, that this condition may be waived for an emergency which, in

the chief administrator pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1951, c.216 (C.39:12-2),
or any Statewide safety organization approved by the chief administrator.  The
course shall be subject to oversight by the commission according to its
guidelines.  The permit holder shall also remit a course fee prior to the
commencement of the course. The chief administrator also shall postpone without
the exercise of discretion or a hearing the issuance of a basic license for 90
days if the chief administrator is notified by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the examination permit holder, after completion of the
remedial training course, has been convicted of any motor vehicle violation
which results in the imposition of any motor vehicle points or has been
