<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 4 of P.L.1968,
c.410 (C.52:14B-4) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  (a)  Prior to the
adoption, amendment, or repeal of any rule, except as may be otherwise
provided, the agency shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Give at least 30 days'
notice of its intended action.  The notice shall include a statement of either
the terms or substance of the intended action or a description of the subjects
and issues involved, <u>including, in the instance of the intended adoption of
a new rule, the identification of least two existing rules that shall be
repealed,</u> and the time when, the place where, and the manner in which
interested persons may present their views thereon.  The notice shall be mailed
to all persons who have made timely requests of the agency for advance notice
of its rule-making proceedings and, in addition to any other public notice
required by law, shall be published in the New Jersey Register.  Notice shall
also be distributed to the news media maintaining a press office to cover the
State House Complex, and made available for public viewing through publication
on the agency's Internet website.  Each agency shall additionally publicize the
intended action and shall adopt rules to prescribe the manner in which it will do
so.  In order to inform those persons most likely to be affected by or
interested in the intended action, each agency shall distribute notice of its
intended action to interested persons, and shall publicize the same, through
the use of an electronic mailing list or similar type of subscription-based
e-mail service. Additional publicity methods that may be employed include
publication of the notice in newspapers of general circulation or in trade,
industry, governmental or professional publications, distribution of press
releases to the news media and posting of notices in appropriate locations,
including the agency's Internet website.  The rules shall prescribe the
circumstances under which each additional method shall be employed; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Prepare for public
distribution at the time the notice appears in the Register, and make available
for public viewing through publication on the agency's Internet website, a
statement setting forth a summary of the proposed rule, as well as a clear and
concise explanation of the purpose and effect of the rule, the specific legal
authority under which its adoption is authorized, a description of the expected
socio-economic impact of the rule, a regulatory flexibility analysis, or the
statement of finding that a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required, as
provided in section 4 of P.L.1986, c.169 (C.52:14B-19), a jobs impact statement
which shall include an assessment of the number of jobs to be generated or lost
if the proposed rule takes effect, an agriculture industry impact statement as
provided in section 7 of P.L.1998, c.48 (C.4:1C-10.3), a housing affordability
impact statement, a smart growth development impact statement, as provided in
section 31 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:14B-4.1b), <u>the identification of at least
two existing rules that shall be repealed should the proposed rule be adopted,
including how the costs of the new rule will be offset by the repeal of the
existing rules, if applicable,</u> and a racial and ethnic community criminal
justice and public safety impact statement as required in section 3 of
P.L.2017, c.286 (C.2C:48B-2); </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Afford all interested
persons a reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, comments, or arguments,
orally or in writing. The agency shall consider fully all written and oral
submissions respecting the proposed rule <u>and the existing rules identified
for repeal</u>, including any written submissions that are received by the
agency through its e-mail systems or electronic mailing lists.  If within 30
days of the publication of the proposed rule sufficient public interest is
demonstrated in an extension of the time for submissions, the agency shall
provide an additional 30-day period for the receipt of submissions by
interested parties.  The agency shall not adopt the proposed rule until after
the end of that 30-day extension. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The agency shall conduct a
public hearing on the proposed rule at the request of a committee of the
Legislature, or a governmental agency or subdivision, or if sufficient public
interest is shown, provided such request is made to the agency within 30 days
following publication of the proposed rule in the Register.  The agency shall
provide at least 15 days' notice of such hearing, shall publish such hearing
notice on its Internet website, and shall conduct the hearing in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (g) of this section.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The head of each agency shall
adopt as part of its rules of practice adopted pursuant to section 3 of
P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-3) definite standards of what constitutes sufficient
public interest for conducting a public hearing and for granting an extension
pursuant to this paragraph; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Prepare for public
distribution, and make available for public viewing through publication on the
agency's Internet website, a report listing all parties offering written or
oral submissions concerning the rule, summarizing the content of the
submissions and providing the agency's response to the data, views, comments,
and arguments contained in the submissions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   A rule prescribing the
organization of an agency may be adopted at any time without prior notice or
hearing.  Such rules shall be effective upon filing in accordance with section
5 of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-5) or upon any later date specified by the
agency.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   If an agency finds that
an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare requires adoption of
a rule upon fewer than 30 days' notice and states in writing its reasons for
that finding, and the Governor concurs in writing that an imminent peril exists,
the agency may proceed to adopt the rule without prior notice or hearing, or
upon any abbreviated notice and hearing that it finds practicable.  The agency
shall publish, on its Internet website, a summary of any rule adopted pursuant
to this subsection, and the statement of reasons for the agency's finding that
an imminent peril exists.  Any rule adopted pursuant to this subsection shall
be effective for a period of not more than 60 days, unless each house of the
Legislature passes a resolution concurring in its extension for a period of not
more than 60 additional days.  The rule shall not be effective for more than

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   No rule hereafter
adopted is valid unless adopted in substantial compliance with P.L.1968, c.410
(C.52:14B-1 et seq.).  A proceeding to contest any rule on the ground of

et seq.) shall be commenced within one year from the effective date of the
rule.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   An agency may file a
notice of intent with respect to a proposed rule-making proceeding with the
Office of Administrative Law, for publication in the New Jersey Register at any
time prior to the formal notice of action required in subsection (a) of this
section. The notice shall be for the purpose of eliciting the views of
interested parties on an action prior to the filing of a formal rule proposal. 
Such notice shall be distributed to interested persons through the use of an
electronic mailing list or similar type of subscription-based e-mail service,
and made available for public viewing through publication on the agency's

opportunity to submit data, views, comments, or arguments, orally or in
writing, on the proposed action, and shall fully consider all written and oral
submissions, including any written submissions received by the agency through
its e-mail systems or electronic mailing lists.  An agency may use informal
conferences and consultations as means of obtaining the viewpoints and advice
of interested persons with respect to contemplated rule-making. An agency may
also appoint committees of experts or interested persons or representatives of
the general public to advise it with respect to any contemplated rule-making.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   An interested person may

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 60 days following
receipt by an agency of any such petition, the agency shall either: (i) deny
the petition, giving a written statement of its reasons; (ii) grant the
petition and initiate a rule-making proceeding within 90 days of granting the
petition; or (iii) refer the matter for further deliberations which shall be
concluded within 90 days of referring the matter for further deliberations. 
Upon conclusion of such further deliberations, the agency shall either deny the
petition and provide a written statement of its reasons or grant the petition
and initiate a rule-making proceeding within 90 days.  Upon the receipt of the
petition, the agency shall file a notice stating the name of the petitioner and
the nature of the request with the Office of Administrative Law for publication
in the New Jersey Register.  Notice of formal agency action on such petition
shall also be filed with the Office of Administrative Law for publication in
the Register, and shall be made available for public viewing through
publication on the agency's Internet website.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If an agency fails to act in
accordance with the time frame set forth in the preceding paragraph, upon
written request by the petitioner, the Director of the Office of Administrative
Law shall order a public hearing on the rule-making petition and shall provide
the agency with a notice of the director's intent to hold the public hearing if
the agency does not.  If the agency does not provide notice of a hearing within
15 days of the director's notice, the director shall schedule, and provide the
public with a notice of, that hearing at least 15 days prior thereto.  Hearing
notice shall also be made available for public viewing through publication on the
agency's Internet website.  If the public hearing is held by the Office of
Administrative Law, it shall be conducted by an administrative law judge, a
person on assignment from another agency, a person from the Office of
Administrative Law assigned pursuant to subsection o. of section 5 of P.L.1978,
c.67 (C.52:14F-5), or an independent contractor assigned by the director.  The
petitioner and the agency shall participate in the public hearing and shall
present a summary of their positions on the petition, a summary of the factual
information on which their positions on the petition are based and shall
respond to questions posed by any interested party. The hearing procedure shall
otherwise be consistent with the requirements for the conduct of a public hearing
as prescribed in subsection (g) of section 4 of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-4),
except that the person assigned to conduct the hearing shall make a report
summarizing the factual record presented and the arguments for and against
proceeding with a rule proposal based upon the petition.  This report shall be
filed with the agency and delivered or mailed to the petitioner.  A copy of the
report shall be filed with the Legislature along with the petition for
rule-making.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   All public hearings
shall be conducted by a hearing officer, who may be an official of the agency,
a member of its staff, a person on assignment from another agency, a person
from the Office of Administrative Law assigned pursuant to subsection o. of
section 5&nbsp;of&nbsp;P.L.1978,&nbsp;c.67&nbsp;(C.52:14F-5)&nbsp;or an
independent contractor.  The hearing officer shall have the responsibility to
make recommendations to the agency regarding the adoption, amendment or repeal
of a rule. These recommendations shall be made public.  At the beginning of
each hearing, or series of hearings, the agency, if it has made a proposal,
shall present a summary of the factual information on which its proposal is
based, and shall respond to questions posed by any interested party.  Hearings
shall be conducted at such times and in locations which shall afford interested
parties the opportunity to attend.  A verbatim record of each hearing shall be
maintained, and copies of the record shall be available to the public at no
more than the actual cost, which shall be that of the agency where the petition
for rule-making originated.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires a State
agency to identify at least two existing rules for repeal for every one new
rule adopted.  The bill is modeled after Executive Order No. 13771 issued by
President Trump on January 30, 2017.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill will result in a more
thoughtful process of rulemaking and attempt to keep the costs of rules from
increasing exponentially. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill will become effective
on the 60th day following enactment in order for each agency to plan for
implementation of the bills requirements.</p>
