and (9)   any other functions required pursuant to Pub.L.107-252 (42 U.S.C. s.15301 et seq.), or Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, or that may be deemed necessary by the Secretary of State. c.    The Statewide voter registration system shall include, but not be limited to, the following information for every legally registered voter in this State: (1)   last, first and middle name;
