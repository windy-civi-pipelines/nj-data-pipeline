STATEMENT This bill provides that any person who receives unemployment insurance benefits by reason of a known or fraudulent nondisclosure or misrepresentation of a material fact shall be liable to repay those benefits in full prior to collecting any future benefits payable to that person under the New Jersey unemployment compensation law, R.S.43:21-1 et seq.  Currently, individuals guilty of unemployment insurance fraud may be allowed to collect benefits before they have repaid in full the amount they fraudulently obtained. The bill increases the fine for fraudulently obtaining benefits to $250 for each offense, or 50 percent of the amount fraudulently obtained, whichever is greater.  Currently, this fine is 25 percent of the amount fraudulently obtained, whichever is greater. The bill also increases the fine for employers that fraudulently prevent or reduce the payment of unemployment insurance benefits to employees, or fraudulently obtain a lower rate of contribution to the unemployment insurance compensation trust fund to $250 or 50 percent of the amount withheld or under-reported, whichever is greater.
