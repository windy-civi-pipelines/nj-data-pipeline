<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 12 of P.L.1999,
c.23 (C.48:3-60) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12. a. Simultaneously with the
starting date for the implementation of retail choice as determined by the
board pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-53), the
board shall permit each electric public utility and gas public utility to
recover some or all of the following costs through a societal benefits charge
that shall be collected as a non-bypassable charge imposed on all electric
public utility customers and gas public utility customers, as appropriate:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) The costs for the social
programs for which rate recovery was approved by the board prior to April 30,
1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to
section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be
set to recover the same level of social program costs as is being collected in
the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of
P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  The board may subsequently order, pursuant
to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits
charge to reflect changes in the costs to the utility of administering existing
social programs.  Nothing in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) shall be
construed to abolish or change any social program required by statute or board
order or rule or regulation to be provided by an electric public utility.  Any
such social program shall continue to be provided by the utility until
otherwise provided by law, unless the board determines that it is no longer
appropriate for the electric public utility to provide the program, or the
board chooses to modify the program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Nuclear plant
decommissioning costs;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  The costs of demand side
management programs that were approved by the board pursuant to its demand side
management regulations prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of
establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23
(C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same
level of demand side management program costs as is being collected in the
bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999,
c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  Within four months of the effective date of P.L.1999,
c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and every four years thereafter, the board shall
initiate a proceeding and cause to be undertaken a comprehensive resource
analysis of energy programs, and within eight months of initiating such
proceeding and after notice, provision of the opportunity for public comment,
and public hearing, the board, in consultation with the Department of
Environmental Protection, shall determine the appropriate level of funding for
energy efficiency, light, medium, and heavy-duty plug-in electric vehicles,
including school buses, and associated plug-in electric vehicle charging
infrastructure, <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and<b><span

those provided by standard offer or similar programs in effect as of the

systems pursuant to the program established by the board pursuant to paragraph
(2) of subsection e. of section 38 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-87).  The</u>
funding for such programs <u>shall</u> be no less than 50 percent of the total
Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for
demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23
(C.48:3-49 et al.) for an initial period of four years from the issuance of the
first comprehensive resource analysis following the effective date of P.L.1999,
c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>provided
that<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
25 percent of this amount shall be used to provide funding for Class I renewable
energy projects in the State.  In each of the following fifth through eighth
years, the Statewide funding for such programs shall be no less than 50 percent
of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public
utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of
P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), except that as additional funds are made
available as a result of the expiration of past standard offer or similar
commitments, the minimum amount of funding for such programs shall increase by
an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the additional funds made
available, until the minimum amount of funding dedicated to such programs
reaches $140,000,000 total.  After the eighth year<u>,</u> the board shall make
a determination as to the appropriate level of funding for these programs. 
Such programs shall include a program to provide financial incentives for the
installation of Class I renewable energy projects in the State, and the board,
in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall
determine the level and total amount of such incentives as well as the
renewable technologies eligible for such incentives which shall include, at a
minimum, photovoltaic, wind, and fuel cells.  The board shall simultaneously
determine, as a result of the comprehensive resource analysis, the programs to
be funded by the societal benefits charge, the level of cost recovery and
performance incentives for old and new programs and whether the recovery of
demand side management programs costs currently approved by the board may be
reduced or extended over a longer period of time.  The board shall make these
determinations taking into consideration existing market barriers and
environmental benefits, with the objective of transforming markets, capturing
lost opportunities, making energy services more affordable for low income
customers and eliminating subsidies for programs that can be delivered in the
marketplace without electric public utility and gas public utility customer funding;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) Manufactured gas plant
remediation costs, which shall be determined initially in a manner consistent
