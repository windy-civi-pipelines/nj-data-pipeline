The bill provides that stream cleaning and desnagging projects and bank stabilization or restoration projects undertaken by the office would not require a permit, approval, or other authorization from the DEP pursuant to any other State law or rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto. Lastly, the bill repeals P.L.1993, c.376 (C.58:16A-67), which set forth a process for local government units to follow when undertaking stream cleaning activities, as stream cleaning activities will be the responsibility of the office to be established pursuant to this bill and the relevant provisions of P.L.1993, c.376 are included in this bill.
