All revenue collected from the Corporate Transit Fee, except for amounts constitutionally dedicated for open space, farmland, and historic preservation, would be deposited into the General Fund and, beginning in State fiscal year 2026, appropriated annually to support New Jersey Transits operating expenses and to pay for the States matching funds required to receive federal funding for eligible New Jersey Transit capital projects.
