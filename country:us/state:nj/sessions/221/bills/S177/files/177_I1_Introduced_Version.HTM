<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. a. There is established in
the Department of Education a four-year New Jersey Grow Your Own Teacher Pilot
Program, the purpose of which shall be to address teacher shortages in
selected school districts, charter schools, or renaissance school projects and
to diversify the teacher workforce in those districts by recruiting,
developing, and supporting minority students in becoming teachers in the school
districts, charter schools, or renaissance school projects from which they
graduated. Under the pilot program, three Grow Your Own Partnerships
established in accordance with subsection b. of this section shall be selected
by the Commissioner of Education in accordance with the application process
established pursuant to subsection c. of this section. The Department of
Education shall provide annual grants to the three selected Grow Your Own
Partnerships throughout the four-year pilot program that, at a minimum, shall
cover the tuition and fee and room and board costs for any students
participating in the program who are attending an institution of higher
education. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. Prior to submitting an
application to the Commissioner pursuant to subsection c. of this section, a
school district, charter school, or renaissance school project or a group of
school districts, charter schools, or renaissance school projects shall form a
Grow Your Own Partnership with an institution of higher education in the State.
A Grow Your Own Partnership may also include a supporting nonprofit
organization. Under a Grow Your Own Partnership, a student seeking to become a
teacher, who attends a partner institution of higher education and who
graduated high school from a school district, charter school, or renaissance
school project that is part of the partnership, would enter into an agreement
with that partnership, to teach in a participating district or school for a
period of at least three years upon graduation from the partner institution of
higher education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c. (1) A Grow Your Own
Partnership seeking support from the State under the pilot program shall apply
to the Commissioner of Education in accordance with application procedures and
requirements prescribed by the commissioner. The application shall include, at
a minimum:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) an agreement between
members of the partnership that outlines the roles and responsibilities of each
member and that conveys a shared commitment to the development and hiring of
students seeking to become teachers in the school districts, charter schools,
or renaissance school projects from which they graduated;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) an implementation plan
that would provide specific details on student recruitment, the process that
students would undergo in order to complete the program proposed by the
partnership, the level and types of supports that would be provided to
students, and the ways in which the partnership would track student progress
through the program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c) a description of financial
support that would be provided to students, including the amount of funding
needed to cover the tuition and fee and room and board costs for any students
participating in the program who are attending an institution of higher
education and any scholarships and stipends that the partnership would provide;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d) an estimate of the number
of students that the partnership seeks to support throughout the duration of
the pilot program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e) a description of the
mentorship that would be provided to students and any other supports and
opportunities that would be offered to students during the academic year and
the summer; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f) a request for the amount
of State grant funds being sought by the partnership, as well as a description
of any other funds that would be used to support the program proposed by the
partnership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) In selecting partnerships
to support, the commissioner shall prioritize partnerships that include one or
more SDA districts as defined in section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3) and
shall give equal consideration to partnerships located in the north, central
and southern geographical regions of the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) The commissioner shall
determine the amount of each award to a partnership in each year of the pilot
program. The amount of each award shall, at a minimum, cover the tuition and
fee and room and board costs for any students participating in the program who
are attending an institution of higher education. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d. (1) As part of the
implementation of the New Jersey Grow Your Own Teacher Pilot Program, the
Department of Education shall organize a New Jersey Grow Your Own Consortium,
consisting of the Grow Your Own Partnerships selected for participation in the
pilot program. The department shall organize and convene meetings of the
consortium, which shall occur on a quarterly basis during the four-year pilot
program. The purpose of the meetings shall be to provide opportunities for the
partnerships to share their experiences administering the programs supported
under this section and to share best practices and potential ideas for
furthering the programs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) The department shall, on
an annual basis throughout the duration of the pilot program, submit to the
Governor and to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164
(C.52:14-19.1), a report evaluating the effectiveness and progress of the pilot
program to date.</p>

immediately.</p>

pilot program, a school district, charter school, or renaissance school project
or a group of school districts, charter schools, or renaissance schools would
form a Grow Your Own Partnership with an institution of higher education in the
State. The bill provides that a Grow Your Own Partnership may also include a
supporting nonprofit organization. Under a Grow Your Own Partnership, a student
seeking to become a teacher, who attends a partner institution of higher
education and who graduated high school from a school district, charter school,
or renaissance school project that is part of the partnership, would enter into
an agreement with that partnership, to teach in a participating district or
school for a period of at least three years upon graduation from the partner
institution of higher education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a Grow Your
Own Partnership seeking support from the State under the pilot program would apply
to the Commissioner of Education in accordance with application procedures and
requirements prescribed by the commissioner. The bill establishes certain
minimum details and information that would be included on an application
submitted by partnership. The bill requires the commissioner to prioritize
partnerships that include one or more SDA districts. The commissioner would
also give equal consideration to partnerships located in the north, central and
southern geographical regions of the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
Department of Education to organize a New Jersey Grow Your Own Consortium,
consisting of the Grow Your Own Partnerships selected for participation in the
pilot program. The department would organize and convene meetings of the
consortium, which shall occur on a quarterly basis during the four-year pilot
program. The purpose of the meetings would be to provide opportunities for the
partnerships to share their experiences administering the programs supported
under the bill and to share best practices and potential ideas for furthering
the programs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lastly, the bill requires the
department, on an annual basis throughout the duration of the pilot program, to
submit to the Governor and to the Legislature, a report evaluating the
effectiveness and progress of the pilot program to date.</p>
