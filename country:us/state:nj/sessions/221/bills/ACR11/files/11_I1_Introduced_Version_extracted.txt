INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This amendment would give an annual property tax deduction to law enforcement officers who have sustained a permanent disability and the officers surviving spouse. The deduction would be $250. Officers would have to be disabled due to the law enforcement service.  The disability does not have to be a total disability, but would have to be permanent. Officers would have to own real property in order to receive this deduction. STATEMENT If approved by the voters of the State, this proposed constitutional amendment would provide an annual $250 property tax deduction to law enforcement officers who have been permanently disabled as the result of their law enforcement service, and to their surviving spouses. The proposed amendment directs the Legislature to define the law enforcement officers eligible to receive the $250 property tax deduction.
