agency shall establish a board of directors of at least five individuals, the
majority of which must be independent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  At a minimum, the board of
directors shall meet at least once every three months.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Upon request, the board of

a board observer.  This individual shall be permitted to participate in all
board and executive meetings as a non-voting observer and may also designate
another individual or professional to assist in the performance of observer
duties and understanding of the provider agencys operations and management. 
Observer obligations shall be limited to advocacy on behalf of recipients and shall
not include any obligations or liabilities related to the management of the
provider agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  A covered provider agency
with revenues over $2 million in the prior State fiscal year shall establish an
audit committee of at least three individuals, all of whom must be independent,
and one shall have a masters level degree in finance or accounting, or a nationally-recognized
credential in finance or accounting that requires annual continuing education
compliance.  The audit committees duties shall include, but shall not be

the audit. </p>

that the revenues received by the covered provider agency are primarily spent
in ways that benefit recipients.  At a minimum, the combined costs of annual
executive compensation, general and administrative expenses, management fees,
interest and lease payments, and similar expenses, plus profit or retained
earnings, shall not exceed 15 percent of program revenues.  Payments in excess
of this percentage shall:  be deemed a violation of the standards for the
health and safety of recipient care; be recovered by the State as an adjustment
of amount paid; and constitute as a condition that supports the appointment of
a receiver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  a.  A covered provider

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides protections
for individuals with developmental disabilities through the establishment of
provider governance and service standards.  These standards apply to provider
agencies that are authorized to bill greater than $250,000 of services in a
State Fiscal Year and to deliver services in provider-managed environments,
which the bill defines as a covered provider agency.  In these environments,
provider agencies substantially control all aspects of the programming and
often the physical setting in which programming occurs.  This arrangement
creates additional vulnerabilities, particularly for individuals that rely on
service providers for all of their long-term care needs.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill sets standards for
provider agency governance to ensure that funds paid by the Division of
Developmental Disabilities (division) in the Department of Human Services are
properly managed and expended on direct client services.  Provider agencies
within the scope of the bill are required to have a minimum of five board
members, the majority of which are required to be independent, as well as to
provide transparency on board composition and meetings.  The bill requires the
appointment a self-advocate or family member or guardian of a service recipient
to each board of directors as a board observer to represent the interests of
recipients and their families.  Covered provider agencies with greater than $2
million of revenue are required to establish an independent audit committee
with a minimum of three members.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires each covered
provider agency to post the three most recent annual audited financial
statements on the provider agencys Internet website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill includes several
provisions to ensure that funds paid by the division are primarily expended on
direct client services.  This includes a cap of 15 percent on program revenue
expenditures for executive compensation, general and administrative costs, and
similar expenses, plus profit and retained earnings.  Existing caps on
compensation have been incorporated, updated, and indexed to future increases
in the States minimum wage.  Similarly, existing prohibitions on loans to
staff members are included.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that no
covered provider agency may pay the costs of any individual salary, except
under certain circumstances, in excess of the schedule set forth under the
bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill protects service
recipients from actions taken by covered provider agencies and their owners
that create significant financial or programmatic risk.  The bill requires that
provider agencies inform the division when a variety of events occur that can
reasonably be expected to adversely impact the provider agencys operation or
service delivery.  These provisions also give the division authority to take
action to address the situation and prevent future reoccurrence, including the
appointment of an independent monitor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires that
covered provider agencies establish policies on the prevention, reporting and
disposition of nepotism, conflicts of interest, non-discrimination and
retaliation.  Policies against retaliation are of particular concern in order
to establish a climate where employees, recipients and families are comfortable
raising service quality concerns with the provider agencys management and the
division.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires each covered
provider agency to employ a full-time salaried manager at each site where the
provider agency delivers provider-managed services to more than three clients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill incorporates
existing insurance and indemnification standards, including the divisions
authority to annually adjust insurance minimums to ensure that coverage remains
consistent with the level of protection needed for staff and service
recipients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill appropriates from the
General Fund to the Department of Human Services the sum of $300,000 for the
purposes of hiring additional staff members to monitor and enforce the
provisions of the bill.</p>
