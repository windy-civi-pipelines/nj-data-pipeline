health, hospital, and medical service corporations, health maintenance
organizations, and commercial group health insurers to provide coverage for an
annual prostate cancer screening without cost sharing for men who are between
40 and 75 years of age.  Under current law, these health insurance carriers are
required only to provide coverage for an annual medically recognized diagnostic
examination including, but not limited to, a digital rectal examination and a
prostate-specific antigen test for men age 50 and over who are asymptomatic and
for men age 40 and over with a family history of  prostate cancer or other
prostate cancer risk factors.  The bill expands the definition of prostate
cancer screening to mean medically viable methods for the detection and
diagnosis of prostate cancer, which includes a digital rectal exam and the
prostate-specific antigen test and associated laboratory work.  Prostate
cancer screening shall also include subsequent follow up testing as direct by
a physician, including, but not limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   urinary analysis;</p>

including, but not limited to, magnetic resonance imaging.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also extends the
prostate cancer screening requirements to commercial individual health
insurers, health benefits plans issued pursuant to the New Jersey Individual
Health Coverage and Small Employer Health Benefits Programs, the State Health
Benefits Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Program, which are
not required to provide this coverage under current law.</p>
