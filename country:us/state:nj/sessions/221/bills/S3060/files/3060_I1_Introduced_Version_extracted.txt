The benefits shall be provided to the same extent as for any other medical condition under the contract except that no deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or any other cost-sharing requirement on the services shall be imposed for men who are between 40 and 75 years of age. b.    As used in this section: Prostate cancer screening means medically viable methods for the detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer, which includes a digital rectal exam and the prostate-specific antigen test and associated laboratory work.  Prostate cancer screening shall also include subsequent follow up testing as direct by a health care provider, including, but not limited to: (1)   urinary analysis; (2)   serum biomarkers; (3)   medical imaging, including, but not limited to, magnetic resonance imaging. 11.  This act shall take effect on the 90th day next following the date of enactment and shall apply to all contracts and policies delivered, issued, executed, or renewed on or after that date. STATEMENT As amended, this bill requires health, hospital, and medical service corporations, health maintenance organizations, and commercial group health insurers to provide coverage for an annual prostate cancer screening without cost sharing for men who are between 40 and 75 years of age.  Under current law, these health insurance carriers are required only to provide coverage for an annual medically recognized diagnostic examination including, but not limited to, a digital rectal examination and a prostate-specific antigen test for men age 50 and over who are asymptomatic and for men age 40 and over with a family history of  prostate cancer or other prostate cancer risk factors.  The bill expands the definition of prostate cancer screening to mean medically viable methods for the detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer, which includes a digital rectal exam and the prostate-specific antigen test and associated laboratory work.  Prostate cancer screening shall also include subsequent follow up testing as direct by a physician, including, but not limited to: (1)   urinary analysis; (2)   serum biomarkers; (3)   medical imaging, including, but not limited to, magnetic resonance imaging. The bill also extends the prostate cancer screening requirements to commercial individual health insurers, health benefits plans issued pursuant to the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage and Small Employer Health Benefits Programs, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Program, which are not required to provide this coverage under current law.
