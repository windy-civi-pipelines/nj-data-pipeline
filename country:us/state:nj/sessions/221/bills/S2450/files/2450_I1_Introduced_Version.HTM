<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    There is established, in
the Department of Human Services, a Pandemic PTSD Task Force.  The purpose of
the task force shall be to evaluate the prevalence and likelihood of, and
develop best practices for the identification and treatment of, pandemic PTSD
in first responders, health care professionals, and other frontline workers in
the State, and recommend the implementation and use of appropriate treatments
and supports to mitigate, eliminate, and otherwise reduce the effects of
pandemic PTSD on these workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The task force shall
consist of 21 members, including:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   five members, or their
