(cf: P.L.2003, c.48, s.1) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill prohibits a court from imposing a sentence of life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole upon a person who committed a crime while under 21 years of age. Under current law, the court may sentence a person under 21 years of age to life imprisonment.  Under the bill, a court would be prohibited from doing so. This bill is in response to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court holding that sentencing individuals from 18 to 20 to serve a life term without the possibility of parole violates the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment and the portion of the relevant Massachusetts statute which denies parole eligibility to those from 18 to 20 years old is unconstitutional.  See Commonwealth v. Mattis, 224 N.E.3d 410 (Mass. 2024).
