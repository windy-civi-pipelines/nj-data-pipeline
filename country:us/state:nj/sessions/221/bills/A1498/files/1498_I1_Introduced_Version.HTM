<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises the Energy
Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief (ETR) Aid Program by requiring all energy
taxes to be paid directly to municipalities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Historically, energy providers
and public utility companies were required to pay gross receipts and franchise
taxes based on their use of public lands.  For many decades, these taxes were
paid directly to municipalities as a means of compensation for hosting such
facilities.  In the 1980s, the State began to collect these taxes on behalf of
municipalities, distribute a portion of the proceeds to municipalities as State
aid, and retain the remaining revenues for other State purposes.  In the late
1990s, this practice was continued when the State established the ETR Aid
program after reforming the taxation of energy providers and public utility
companies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the State
is required to annually deposit a statutorily determined amount of monies into
the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund and distribute those monies
to municipalities as ETR Aid.  Every year, the total distribution of ETR Aid is
required to increase based on inflation.  During any year in which the State
fails to provide this aid, the State is required to forego the collections of
certain taxes on energy providers and public utilities (e.g., sales tax
collections for energy services, corporation business tax collections from
certain public utility companies, etc.), hereinafter referred to as energy
taxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, the ETR Aid
program would be restructured to reflect the original design of the gross
receipts and franchise taxes, wherein all energy taxes were paid directly to
municipalities.  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2022, and during each year
thereafter, the bill requires the State Treasurer to: (1) determine the
aggregate amount of ETR Aid provided Statewide; (2) determine the amounts
provided to each municipality; (3) direct each energy taxpayer to make direct
payment of energy taxes to one or more municipalities; and (4) advise each
municipality of the name of each energy taxpayer that would make direct payment
of energy taxes to the municipality, the amounts owed therefrom, and the dates
on which each payment would be provided.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The State Treasurer would also
be required to establish additional requirements concerning the payment of ETR
Aid, including but not limited to dates on which each payment would be
provided.  The bill provides that whenever an energy tax payment is made
directly to a municipality, the amount of the payment may be taken as a credit
against the tax liability of the energy taxpayer, as prescribed by the State
Treasurer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
provides that beginning in Fiscal Year 2022, the aggregate amount of ETR Aid
provided during any fiscal year is required to equal the greater of: (1) the
total amount that would have been otherwise provided under current law; or (2)
the total amount of energy taxes due and payable during that fiscal year. 
Consequently, the bill would prevent the State from retaining any portion of
these energy tax collections for other State purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, if the total
energy taxes due and payable during any fiscal year exceed the amount of ETR
Aid that would have been otherwise provided under current law, then the
difference would be distributed amongst all municipalities in proportion to the
equalized assessed valuation of real and personal property owned by all energy taxpayers
located within each municipality, as determined by the State Treasurer. 
Alternatively, the bill also provides that if the total energy taxes due and
payable during any fiscal year is less than the amount of ETR Aid that would
have been otherwise provided under current law, then the State Treasurer is
required to make such additional payments as are necessary, from the Property
Tax Relief Fund, to ensure that each municipality receives the amount owed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     During any fiscal year in
which the State fails to comply with the requirements of this bill, the State
would be required to forego the collection of all energy taxes.</p>
