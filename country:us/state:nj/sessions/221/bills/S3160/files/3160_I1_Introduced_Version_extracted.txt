The monitoring program shall provide a system for review of reports submitted by a court-appointed guardian of an elderly adult, which may include reports concerning the wards well-being, and inventory and accounting reports. In order to accomplish the goal of the program, the public guardian shall: (1)   Ensure that the court-appointed guardian is in compliance with the initial and periodic reporting requirements for a guardian of an elderly adult as established by the Superior Court pursuant to a judgment of incapacity or judgment of guardianship, or as required pursuant to letters of guardianship issued by the Surrogate; (2)   Review reports and accompanying documentation submitted by the court-appointed guardian in accordance with the established reporting requirements; and (3)   If any problems or inconsistencies are identified following review of the reports and documentation, the Public Guardian may intervene in proceedings in accordance with subsection h. of this section. For the purposes of this section, the Office of the Public Guardian for Elderly Adults shall be deemed an interested party and therefore be served with any initial and periodic reports as required by the Superior Court or Surrogate; j.     Shall perform any other function which may be prescribed by this act or by any other law; and [j.] k.   Shall appoint and employ, notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.1944, c.20 (C.52:17A-1 et seq.), a general counsel and such other attorneys or counsel as the public guardian may require, for the purpose, among other things, of providing legal advice on such matters as the public guardian may from time to time require, of attending to and dealing with all litigation, controversies, and legal matters in which the public guardian or any ward of the public guardian may be a party or in which these rights and interests may be involved, and of representing the public guardian and any ward in all proceedings or actions of any kind which may be brought for or against them in any court of this State.  With respect to all of the foregoing, the counsel and attorneys shall be independent of any supervision or control by the Attorney General or by the Department of Law and Public Safety, or by any division or officer thereof. (cf: P.L.1989, c.248, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect on the 60th day following enactment. STATEMENT This bill establishes a guardianship monitoring program within the Office of the Public Guardian for Elderly Adults to monitor court-appointed legal guardians of elderly adults to detect abuse, neglect, or exploitation.  P.L.1985, c.298 (C.52:27G-20 et seq.), which established the Public Guardian for Elderly Adults, provides for guardianship services to be provided to elderly persons when private guardianship is not feasible.  Under the bill, the Office of the Public Guardian for Elderly Adults is designated as an interested party that must be served with the periodic reports that must be filed by a court-appointed guardian. The bill provides for review of these reports and accompanying documentation through the guardianship monitoring program.
