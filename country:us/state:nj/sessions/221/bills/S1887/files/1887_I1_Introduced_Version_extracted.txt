Ordinarily thefts of this amount are graded as crimes of the fourth degree. The bill also upgrades theft when the amount is less than $200.00 to a crime of the fourth degree from a disorderly persons offense. Theft from an elderly person when the amount involved exceeds $500.00 but is less than $75,000.00 continues to be a crime of the third degree.
