Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) Sections 1
through 7 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this
bill) shall be known and may be cited as the Liberty State Park Protection
Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    Liberty State Park,
located in Jersey City, is a priceless New Jersey and American treasure and an
urban oasis in the middle of densely populated metropolitan northern New
Jersey;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    With
internationally-recognized landmarks including the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis
Island, and the Manhattan skyline as a spectacular backdrop, Liberty State Park
is one of the nations most sacred and inspiring parks; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    Encompassing over 1,200
acres, approximately 600 acres of land and 600 acres of water, of which all but
the interiors 235 acre natural restoration area are open to the public currently,
the park contains significant natural, historic, recreational, scenic, and
cultural resources;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The park, a major
historic and cultural resource with its transportation and immigration history,
includes: the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal or CRRNJ Terminal, the
third landmark of America's Gateway Historic Trilogy along with Lady Liberty
and Ellis Island; the location of portions of the historic Morris Canal, with
its significance to the local, region, and statewide transportation industry
during the 19th and 20th centuries; and also the location of<b><sup><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'> </span></sup></b>the
Black Tom Island 1916 explosion historic site, with its significance to
Americas entry into World War One;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.    The park is also a major
natural resource as a sanctuary for over 300 bird species including migratory
species that use the park as a stopover while on the Atlantic Flyway, and
countless other wildlife species;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     More than five million
people from around New Jersey, our nation, and the world visit the park each
year to take in the dramatic and meaningful views and enjoy the peacefulness
and passive recreational opportunities of green open space, the beauty of
nature and wildlife habitats, family picnic areas, and fishing in the midst of
the most urbanized area on the East Coast; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Unfortunately, this unique
and scarce urban green open space has been the target of repeated privatization
and commercialization proposals since the park opened, and the subject of a
number of development proposals in recent years, including the Department of
Environmental Protection issuing requests for proposals to privatize or
commercialize portions of the park, which, if approved, would have seriously
jeopardized this beloved public resource and severely harmed the publics
ability to enjoy free and full public access to and enjoyment of the park; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    From the time of its
opening on June 14, 1976, Liberty State Park has had sustained overwhelming
public support for a free and green open space park, and overwhelming
opposition to privatization and commercialization proposals, as expressed in
public hearings, countless public comments, petitions, and in a series of
coalitions of local, regional, and Statewide groups to protect Liberty State
Park as a Peoples Park behind Lady Liberty; and  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     It is fitting, proper,
and necessary to recognize and respect this history of overwhelming public
opposition and to take action to protect Liberty State Park from any inappropriate
development proposals and to preserve Liberty State Park for future
generations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

only approve an agreement for a concession, conveyance, lease, or other
agreement with a private entity to provide small-scale commercial activities if
the agreement enhances the experience of a visitor to Liberty State Park, such
as a bicycle or kayak rental concession, food concession, temporary winter
skating rink, commercial boat tour operating from an existing boat slip, and
use of the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal (CRRNJ Terminal), and
other uses identified in the management plan developed pursuant to the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, whenever the DEP
proposes to enter into a concession, lease, or other agreement for a duration
of one year or longer, the DEP would be required to present the proposal to the
committee for review and recommendations and provide an opportunity for public
comment on the proposal, including holding two public hearings at Liberty State
Park, with one hearing being held on a weekday evening and one on the weekend,
and providing a 30-day public comment period.  In addition, the DEP would be
required to take these same actions when it intends to convey lands acquired or
developed by the State with Green Acres funds, or acquired or developed by the
State in any other manner and administered by the department, located within or
adjacent to Liberty State Park.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Liberty State Park
Advisory Committee established by the bill would be charged with assisting the
DEP in conserving, preserving, protecting, and improving Liberty State Park. 
In carrying out its responsibilities, the committee would give due
consideration to the natural, historic, cultural, recreational, and scenic
resources and the local, State, and national significance of Liberty State Park. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The committees responsibilities
would include: assisting the DEP in developing the management plan required by
the bill, and advising the DEP on the ecological restoration of the 235-acre
interior portion of the park and means to increase public access and public
enjoyment of the natural, historic, cultural, recreational, and scenic
resources of the park; reviewing and making recommendations concerning
concessions, leases, or other transfer of property rights with a duration of
one year or longer; and submitting to the DEP Commissioner any recommendations
the committee deems necessary to improve, protect the park.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, this bill would
amend the State Park and Forestry Resources Act, P.L.1983, c. 324 (C.13:1L-1
et seq.), which, in part, allows the DEP to enter agreements with private
entities for the construction, operation, and maintenance for private profit of
any facility, utility, or device in State parks and forests as the DEP finds
proper for the use and enjoyment of the lands by the public.  This bill would
amend the law to reflect the provisions of this bill concerning agreements
related to Liberty State Park.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lastly, the bill would amend
the Hackensack Meadowlands Agency Consolidation Act to delete the provision
that provided the commission, i.e., the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority, which under current law is also referred to as the Meadowlands
Regional Commission, with certain authority concerning Liberty State Park.</p>
