Any member electing to make a purchase pursuant to this section who retires prior to completing payments as agreed with the retirement system will receive pro rata credit for the purchase prior to the date of retirement, but if the member so elects at the time of retirement, the member may make the additional lump sum payment required at that time to provide full credit. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, service credit established in the retirement system by a member through purchase in accordance with this section, which purchase was made by an application submitted on or after the effective date of P.L.2008, c.89, except a purchase for [military] active service in the Armed Forces of the United States or a Reserve Component thereof, shall not be eligible for consideration when service is used to determine the qualification of the member for any health care benefits coverage paid, in whole or in part, by a public employer after the member's retirement.

No application shall be accepted for the purchase of credit for [the]: (1) a period of service if, at the time of application, the member has a vested right to retirement benefits in another retirement system based in whole or in part upon that service; or (2) a period of active service in a Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States that is concurrent with other service described in the preceding paragraph. The member may purchase credit for the service by paying into the annuity savings fund the amount required by applying the factor, supplied by the actuary as being applicable to the member's age at the time of the purchase, to the member's salary at that time, or to the highest annual compensation for service in this State for which contributions were made during any prior fiscal year of membership, whichever is greater.  The purchase may be made in regular installments equal to at least 1/2 of the full normal contribution to the retirement system, over a maximum period of 10 years.  The employer of a member who applies, pursuant to this section, to purchase credit for public employment with the United States Government or for military service in the Armed Forces of the United States shall not be liable for any payment to the retirement system on behalf of the member for the purchase of this credit. Notwithstanding any provision of this act to the contrary, a member shall not be liable for any costs associated with the financing of pension adjustment benefits and health care benefits for retirees when purchasing credit for public employment in other states or with the United States Government or [military] active service in the Armed Forces of the United States or a Reserve Component thereof. Any member electing to purchase the service who retires prior to completing payments as agreed with the retirement system will receive pro rata credit for service purchased prior to the date of retirement, but if the member so elects at the time of retirement, the member may make the additional lump sum payment required at that time to provide full credit. (cf: P.L.1991, c.153, s.3) 10.  (New section) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a resident of this State who is in active service in the Armed Forces of the United States or is a member of a Reserve Component thereof, and has not been discharged or released therefrom, but who otherwise qualifies as a veteran, shall be eligible for a civil service preference on the same basis as a veteran.  Instead of the evidence of discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable required to be provided to the Adjutant General of the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs pursuant to N.J.S.11A:5-1, the applicant shall provide to the Adjutant General, in a form and content the Adjutant General shall deem appropriate, sufficient evidence of record of service as a person who (1) served at least 90 days of active service in the Armed Forces of the United States, excluding any period of service for basic training or as a cadet or midshipman at one of the service academies, or (2) served as a member of a Reserve Component of the Armed Forces of the United States for an entire period for which called to federal active service, not including active duty for training. 11.  N.J.S.11A:5-13, section 3 of P.L.2001, c.128 (C.43:15A-24b), and section 1 of P.L.1983, c.391 (C.43:16A-11.7) are repealed. 12.  This act shall take effect immediately, but section 1 and section 3 shall take effect on the 1st day of the calendar year following approval by the voters of an authorizing amendment to Article VII, Section I, paragraph 2 of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey. STATEMENT This bill broadens the eligibility for certain veterans' benefits by eliminating the requirement that a veteran serve during specific wars or other periods of emergency, and, in certain instances, that a veteran serve in a war zone.  Instead of service during specific dates or in specific locations, the bill requires a veteran to serve for at least 90 days, exclusive of certain types of initial training, in order to be eligible for any of the veterans' benefits identified in the bill. The bill also requires a veteran of a Reserve Component of the United States Armed Forces, including the National Guard, to serve the entire period to which called to federal active service, exclusive of training, in order to be eligible for the veterans' benefits.  A veteran who is discharged as the result of a service-connected disability will be eligible even if the veteran has not completed the 90 day service period or the period to which called to federal active service. The benefits that an eligible veteran could apply for are (1) a civil service hiring preference under Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes; (2) a veteran's retirement allowance under the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF) or the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS); and (3) the purchase of additional military service credit in the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), TPAF and PERS.  In addition, the surviving spouse of a veteran or of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a Reserve Component thereof killed while in active service is eligible in certain instances for a civil service preference. The bill also provides that an active service member of the United States Armed Forces or a member of a Reserve Component thereof, including the National Guard, who has not been discharged from service is eligible for the civil service hiring preference provided that the member otherwise qualifies as a veteran. Eligibility for civil service hiring preference is contingent upon voter approval of an authorizing amendment to the State Constitution.

STATEMENT This bill broadens the eligibility for certain veterans' benefits by eliminating the requirement that a veteran serve during specific wars or other periods of emergency, and, in certain instances, that a veteran serve in a war zone.  Instead of service during specific dates or in specific locations, the bill requires a veteran to serve for at least 90 days, exclusive of certain types of initial training, in order to be eligible for any of the veterans' benefits identified in the bill. The bill also requires a veteran of a Reserve Component of the United States Armed Forces, including the National Guard, to serve the entire period to which called to federal active service, exclusive of training, in order to be eligible for the veterans' benefits.  A veteran who is discharged as the result of a service-connected disability will be eligible even if the veteran has not completed the 90 day service period or the period to which called to federal active service. The benefits that an eligible veteran could apply for are (1) a civil service hiring preference under Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes; (2) a veteran's retirement allowance under the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF) or the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS); and (3) the purchase of additional military service credit in the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), TPAF and PERS.  In addition, the surviving spouse of a veteran or of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a Reserve Component thereof killed while in active service is eligible in certain instances for a civil service preference. The bill also provides that an active service member of the United States Armed Forces or a member of a Reserve Component thereof, including the National Guard, who has not been discharged from service is eligible for the civil service hiring preference provided that the member otherwise qualifies as a veteran. Eligibility for civil service hiring preference is contingent upon voter approval of an authorizing amendment to the State Constitution.
