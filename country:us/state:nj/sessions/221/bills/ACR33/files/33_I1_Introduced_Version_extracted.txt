STATEMENT If approved by the voters of the State, this proposed constitutional amendment would authorize a municipality, by ordinance, to provide a partial property tax exemption on the primary residence of volunteer first responders serving in the municipality.

An eligible first responder would be an active member of a volunteer fire department or a volunteer first aid or ambulance squad who owns a home in the municipality in which the volunteer serves, and the home must be the volunteers primary residence. The municipality would decide the percentage amount of the exemption, which cannot exceed 10 percent of the assessed value.
