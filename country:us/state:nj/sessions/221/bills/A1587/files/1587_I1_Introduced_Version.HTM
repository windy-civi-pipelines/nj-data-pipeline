<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 3 of P.L.2010,
c.3 (C.18A:30-3.6) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    <u>a.</u> 
Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, a board of
education, or an agency or instrumentality thereof, shall not pay supplemental
compensation to any officer or employee for accumulated unused sick leave in an
amount in excess of $15,000.  Supplemental compensation shall be payable only
at the time of retirement from a State-administered or locally-administered
retirement system based on the leave credited on the date of retirement.  This
provision shall apply only to officers and employees who commence service with
the board of education, or the agency or instrumentality thereof, on or after the
effective date of P.L.2010, c.3.  This section shall not be construed to affect
the terms in any collective negotiations agreement with a relevant provision in
force on that effective date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>b.    (1) As used in this subsection,
officer or employee means an officer or employee for whom there is a majority
representative for collective negotiations purposes who was in service with the
employer prior to the effective date of P.L.2010, c.3 and continuously
thereafter or who commenced service on or after that effective date.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(2)   Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection a. of this section or any other law to the contrary, a
board of education, or an agency or instrumentality thereof, shall not pay
supplemental compensation to any officer or employee for accumulated unused
sick leave earned after the effective date of P.L.   , c.   (pending before the
Legislature as this bill) or after the expiration of a collective negotiations
agreement with a relevant provision applicable to that officer or employee in
effect on that date, except as provided in this subsection.  An officer or
employee who on the effective date of P.L.   , c.   (pending before the
Legislature as this bill), or upon the expiration of a collective negotiations
agreement with a relevant provision applicable to that officer or employee in
effect on that date, has accrued supplemental compensation based upon
accumulated unused sick leave earned prior to the effective date shall continue
to be eligible to receive the amount so accrued based on that sick leave that
remains credited on the date of</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u>retirement.  Supplemental
compensation shall be payable only at the time of retirement from a
State-administered or locally-administered retirement system based on the leave
credited on the date of retirement.  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>If the accrued supplemental
compensation based upon accumulated unused sick leave earned prior to the
effective date is $7,500 or more at the time of retirement based on that sick
leave that remains credited on the date of retirement, accumulated unused sick
leave earned after the effective date shall have no monetary value and shall
not be paid for the purpose of supplemental compensation or for the purposes
set forth in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection.  If the accrued
supplemental compensation based upon accumulated unused sick leave earned prior
to the effective date is less than $7,500 at the time of retirement based on
that sick leave that remains credited on the date of retirement, accumulated
unused sick leave earned after the effective date shall have no monetary value
except for the purposes set forth in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection,
but only to a maximum amount equal to the difference between $7,500 and the
accrued supplemental compensation based upon accumulated unused sick leave earned
prior to the effective date that remains credited on the date of retirement. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(3)   Upon the retirement
of an officer or employee who is eligible to receive after retirement health
care benefits coverage that is fully or partly paid by the employer or a public
entity, the employer shall calculate the dollar value of the number of days of
unused sick leave earned after the effective date of P.L.   , c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(pending&nbsp;before
the Legislature as this bill) or after the expiration of a collective
negotiations agreement with a relevant provision applicable to that officer or
employee in effect on that date, without the application of interest, which
value shall not exceed the limit specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection. 
The dollar value shall be calculated using the number of such days that may be
used for the calculation and the per diem or other rate, if any, that have been
agreed upon through collective negotiations between the employer and the
majority representative of the relevant officer or employee, if the agreement
contains provisions regarding these items.  Following the calculation of the
total dollar value, the employer shall divide the total value by 60 in order to
determine a monthly payment of equal amounts for a period of five years.  In
addition to any other contributions by the employer, contributions by that
employer in the amount of such monthly payments, not to exceed the value limit
in the aggregate, shall be paid from appropriations and applied towards the contributions
for health care benefits coverage required of such retired officer or employee,
whether as a percentage of premium, percentage of the retirement allowance, or
a specific amount, to the extent necessary to pay such contributions.  The
remaining amount, if any, necessary to pay such contributions shall be paid by
such retired officer or employee.  If the survivor of the public officer or
employee is eligible to continue, after the death of the officer or employee,
to receive health care benefits coverage that is fully or partly paid by the
employer or a public entity, the monthly payments shall continue if provided
for in a collective negotiations agreement, and shall be applied towards
contributions required of that survivor, but only for the period of time
remaining for such payments after the death of the officer or employee or for
the period of time permitted by law or contract, whichever time period is
shorter. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The employer shall notify
the public entity responsible for the payments for the health care benefits
coverage provided to such officers and employees if other than the employer.

of supplemental compensation for unused sick leave that is earned after the
bills effective date by a current or future State, local government, or board
of education officer or employee whether or not the officer or employee has a
majority representative for collective negotiations purposes.  Supplemental
compensation for any time earned prior to that date will be payable as under
current law.</span></p>

letter-spacing:0pt'>      Under the bill, for an officer or employee who has a
majority representative, if the supplemental compensation based upon
accumulated unused sick leave earned prior to the effective date is $7,500 or
more at the time of retirement, accumulated unused sick leave earned after the
effective date will have no monetary value.  If the supplemental compensation
based upon accumulated unused sick leave earned prior to the effective date is
less than $7,500 at the time of retirement, upon the retirement of an officer
or employee who is eligible to receive after retirement health care benefits
coverage that is fully or partly paid by the employer or a public entity, the
employer will determine the dollar value of the number of days of unused sick
leave earned after the effective date of the bill or after the expiration of a
collective negotiations agreement with a relevant provision applicable to that
officer or employee in effect on that date, without interest, which cannot
exceed $7,500 in the aggregate taking into account the value of the sick leave
earned prior to the effective date.  For local government and education
officers and employees who have a majority representative, the dollar value
will be calculated using the number of such days that may be used for the
calculation and the per diem or other rate, if any, that have been agreed upon
through collective negotiations between the employer and the majority
representative of the relevant officer or employee, if the agreement contains
provisions regarding these items.  For State employees who have a majority
representative, the value will be calculated in accordance with current law. 
In addition to any other contributions by the employer, the employer will make
contributions in equal monthly payments for a period of five years, not to
exceed $7,500 in the aggregate, from appropriations which will be applied
toward the contributions for health care benefits coverage required of such
retired officer or employee, whether as a percentage of premium, percentage of
the retirement allowance, or a specific amount, to the extent necessary to pay
such contributions.  The remaining amount, if any, necessary to pay such
contributions will be contributed by such retired officer or employee.  This would
also apply to the survivor of a deceased retired officer or employee if the
survivor has been provided with health care benefits coverage, by law or
contract, that is fully or partly paid by the employer or a public entity.</span></p>

a majority representative, who is not eligible to receive, or for whom the
employer or a public entity does not provide, health care benefits coverage
after retirement that is fully or partly paid by the employer or a public entity,
the provisions of the above paragraph will not apply and a Health Reimbursement
Arrangement, or a substantially similar account, by the employer will be
established and governed in accordance with the requirements of the Internal
Revenue Service and the Internal Revenue Code.  The purpose of the arrangement
will be for the employer to reimburse the retiree or eligible person for
qualified medical expenses incurred by the retiree up to the dollar value of
the accumulated unused sick leave, if any, as computed in accordance with a
collective negotiations agreement in the aggregate, but only up to one fifth of
that amount annually for five years.  The arrangement will reimburse the
retiree or eligible person for copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, and services
as set forth in the plan document and permitted by the Internal Revenue Service
and Code.  The plan document will provide for the carry forward of the total
amount of the unused reimbursement from year to year for five years.  Unused
reimbursement will not be payable as cash to the retiree or the retirees
estate or beneficiaries.  The arrangement will be available to the survivor of
the retiree, in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service or Code, if
permitted by law or a collective negotiations agreement.</span></p>
