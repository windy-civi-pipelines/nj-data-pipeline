Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><sup><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>1</span></sup></b><b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>1. R.S.43:21-5
is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43:21-5.  An individual shall
be disqualified for benefits:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) For the week in which the
individual has left work voluntarily without good cause attributable to such
work, and for each week thereafter until the individual becomes reemployed and
works eight weeks in employment, which may include employment for the federal
government, and has earned in employment at least 10 times the individual's
weekly benefit rate, as determined in each case.  This subsection shall apply
to any individual seeking unemployment benefits on the basis of employment in
the production and harvesting of agricultural crops, including any individual
who was employed in the production and harvesting of agricultural crops on a
contract basis and who has refused an offer of continuing work with that
employer following the completion of the minimum period of work required to
fulfill the contract.  This subsection shall not apply to an individual who
voluntarily leaves work with one employer to accept from another employer
employment which commences not more than seven days after the individual leaves
employment with the first employer, <u>or an individual who leaves work with
the first employer upon receipt of an offer of employment from another employer
to commence not more than 10 days after the individual leaves work, but the offer
is rescinded through no fault of the individual,</u> if the employment with the
second employer has weekly hours or pay not less than the hours or pay of the
employment of the first employer, except that if the individual gives notice to
the first employer that the individual will leave employment on a specified
date and the first employer terminates the individual before that date, the <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>seven-day<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>10-day</u>
period will commence from the specified date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) For the week in which the
individual has been suspended or discharged for misconduct connected with the
work, and for the five weeks which immediately follow that week, as determined
in each case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Misconduct&quot; means
conduct which is improper, intentional, connected with the individual's work,
within the individual's control, not a good faith error of judgment or
discretion, and is either a deliberate refusal, without good cause, to comply
with the employer's lawful and reasonable rules made known to the employee or a
deliberate disregard of standards of behavior the employer has a reasonable
right to expect, including reasonable safety standards and reasonable standards
for a workplace free of drug and substance use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event the discharge
should be rescinded by the employer voluntarily or as a result of mediation or
arbitration, this subsection (b) shall not apply, provided, however, an
individual who is restored to employment with back pay shall return any
benefits received under this chapter for any week of unemployment for which the
individual is subsequently compensated by the employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the discharge was for gross
misconduct connected with the work because of the commission of an act
punishable as a crime of the first, second, third or fourth degree under the
&quot;New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice,&quot; N.J.S.2C:1-1 et seq., the
individual shall be disqualified in accordance with the disqualification
prescribed in subsection (a) of this section and no benefit rights shall accrue
to any individual based upon wages from that employer for services rendered
prior to the day upon which the individual was discharged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The director shall ensure that
any appeal of a determination holding the individual disqualified for gross
misconduct in connection with the work shall be expeditiously processed by the
appeal tribunal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To sustain disqualification
from benefits because of misconduct under this subsection (b), the burden of
proof is upon the employer, who shall, prior to a determination by the
department of misconduct, provide written documentation demonstrating that the
employee's actions constitute misconduct or gross misconduct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing within this subsection
(b) shall be construed to interfere with the exercise of rights protected under
the &quot;National Labor Relations Act,&quot; (29 U.S.C. s.151 et seq.) or the
&quot;New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act,&quot; P.L.1941, c.100
(C.34:13A-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c) If it is found that the
individual has failed, without good cause, either to apply for available,
suitable work when so directed by the employment office or the director or to
accept suitable work when it is offered, or to return to the individual's
customary self-employment (if any) when so directed by the director.  The
disqualification shall continue for the week in which the failure occurred and
for the three weeks which immediately follow that week, as determined:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) In determining whether or
not any work is suitable for an individual, consideration shall be given to the
degree of risk involved to health, safety, and morals, the individual's
physical fitness and prior training, experience and prior earnings, the
individual's length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in
the individual's customary occupation, and the distance of the available work
from the individual's residence.  In the case of work in the production and
harvesting of agricultural crops, the work shall be deemed to be suitable
without regard to the distance of the available work from the individual's
residence if all costs of transportation are provided to the individual and the
terms and conditions of hire are as favorable or more favorable to the
individual as the terms and conditions of the individual's base year
