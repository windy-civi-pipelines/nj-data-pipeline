Although it is often unrecognized, the Secret Services ability to maintain public safety and security for individuals, facilities, and events covered under its protection depends on the agencys effective cooperation and coordination with state and local governments.  The July 13, 2024 assassination attempt on Former President, and current presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, further highlights the ongoing need for effective cooperation and coordination to protect major presidential and vice-presidential candidates and maintain public safety throughout election campaigns. The State of New Jersey and its municipalities are not only honored to host any individuals under Secret Service protection, but also take seriously the responsibility to cooperate with the Secret Service to ensure the safety and security surrounding such occasions.  However, the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities that are dedicated to ensuring effective cooperation with the Secret Service often place undue financial burdens on the State and its municipalities. The Presidential Security Resources Reimbursement Act of 2024, recently introduced in Congress as H.R.9332, would authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to utilize the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of State and local governments, on a reimbursement basis, for public safety and law enforcement purposes surrounding events and appearances involving major presidential and vice presidential candidates.  The enactment of this bill would provide the State and its municipalities the funding necessary to effectively cooperate and coordinate with the Secret Service in order to protect major presidential and vice presidential candidates and ensure public safety during campaign events and appearances within the State.
