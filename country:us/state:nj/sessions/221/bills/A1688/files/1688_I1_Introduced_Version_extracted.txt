STATEMENT This bill permits lawsuits for abusive litigation for the interference with a legally protected health care activity or reproductive health care services under certain circumstances. P.L.2021, c.375 provides that all individuals in the State have the fundamental right to choose or refuse contraception or sterilization, and choose whether to carry a pregnancy, give birth, or terminate a pregnancy.  Under P.L.2022, c.50, the Governor is prohibited from cooperating in the extradition of a person in New Jersey, who is charged in another state that is making the demand for extradition, with providing, receiving, assisting in providing or receiving, providing material support for, or traveling to obtain, reproductive health care services that are permitted under New Jersey law.  Under P.L.2022, c.51, a health care professional is prohibited, in any civil action, from disclosing communications or information concerning the patients reproductive health care services, unless the patient or the patients legal representative explicitly consented in writing.
