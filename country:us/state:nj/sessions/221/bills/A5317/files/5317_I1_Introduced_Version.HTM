(1) A person is guilty of assault by auto or vessel when the person drives a vehicle or vessel recklessly and causes either serious bodily injury or bodily injury to another.  Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the fourth degree if serious bodily injury results and is a disorderly persons offense if bodily injury results.  Proof that the defendant was operating a hand-held wireless telephone while driving a motor vehicle in violation of section 1 of P.L.2003, c.310 (C.39:4-97.3) may give rise to an inference that the defendant was driving recklessly. (2)   Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the third degree if the person drives the vehicle while in violation of R.S.39:4-50 or section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a) and serious bodily injury results and is a crime of the fourth degree if the person drives the vehicle while in violation of R.S.39:4-50 or section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a) and bodily injury results.

Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the third degree if bodily injury results from the defendant operating the auto or vessel in violation of this paragraph. A map or true copy of a map depicting the location and boundaries of the area on or within 1,000 feet of any property used for school purposes which is owned by or leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board produced pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1987, c.101 (C.2C:35-7) may be used in a prosecution under subparagraph (a) of paragraph (3) of this subsection. It shall be no defense to a prosecution for a violation of subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that the defendant was unaware that the prohibited conduct took place while on or within 1,000 feet of any school property or while driving through a school crossing.  Nor shall it be a defense to a prosecution under subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that no juveniles were present on the school property or crossing zone at the time of the offense or that the school was not in session. (4)   Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the third degree if the person purposely drives a vehicle in an aggressive manner directed at another vehicle and serious bodily injury results and is a crime of the fourth degree if the person purposely drives a vehicle in an aggressive manner directed at another vehicle and bodily injury results. For purposes of this paragraph, driving a vehicle in an aggressive manner shall include, but is not limited to, unexpectedly altering the speed of the vehicle, making improper or erratic traffic lane changes, disregarding traffic control devices, failing to yield the right of way, or following another vehicle too closely. As used in this subsection, vessel means a means of conveyance for travel on water and propelled otherwise than by muscular power. d.    A person who is employed by a facility as defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-2) who commits a simple assault as defined in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection a. of this section upon an institutionalized elderly person as defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-2) is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2001, c.443). f.     A person who commits a simple assault as defined in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection a. of this section in the presence of a child under 16 years of age at a school or community sponsored youth sports event is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.  The defendant shall be strictly liable upon proof that the offense occurred, in fact, in the presence of a child under 16 years of age.  It shall not be a defense that the defendant did not know that the child was present or reasonably believed that the child was 16 years of age or older.  The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to create any liability on the part of a participant in a youth sports event or to abrogate any immunity or defense available to a participant in a youth sports event.  As used in this act, school or community sponsored youth sports event means a competition, practice, or instructional event involving one or more interscholastic sports teams or youth sports teams organized pursuant to a nonprofit or similar charter or which are member teams in a youth league organized by or affiliated with a county or municipal recreation department and shall not include collegiate, semi-professional or professional sporting events. (cf: P.L.2024, c.94, s.1) 4. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the felony murder, aggravated manslaughter, and aggravated assault statutes to include death or bodily injury occurring during the commission of an auto theft. Under current law, paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:11-3 generally defines what is commonly known as the felony murder rule as a homicide occurring when the defendant is engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery, sexual assault, arson, burglary, kidnapping, carjacking, criminal escape, or terrorism, and in the course of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom, the defendant causes the death of another.  Under the bill, auto theft is added to the list of crimes to which the felony murder rule would apply.  Felony murder is a crime of the first degree, and is subject to sentencing enhancements specific to murder. Under current law, paragraph (2) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:11-4 defines aggravated manslaughter as a homicide occurring when the defendant causes the death of another while fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer. Aggravated manslaughter is a strict liability crime which does not require the prosecutor to prove that the defendant was reckless or intoxicated, and the defendant is liable even if the death was actually caused by a pursuing police officer. Under the bill, aggravated manslaughter is expanded to include death while driving a stolen motor vehicle at any time, whether or not the defendant was attempting to flee the police.  Aggravated manslaughter is a crime of the first degree. Under current law, pursuant to paragraph (6) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1, aggravated assault includes causing bodily injury to another while fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer, or while operating a motor vehicle in violation of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:20-10 (commonly known as the joyriding statute).  Aggravated assault is a strict liability crime which does not require the prosecutor to prove that the defendant was reckless or intoxicated, and the defendant is liable even if the injury was actually caused by a pursuing police officer.  This section of law was not updated to reflect the recent enactment of section 1 of P.L.2023, c.101 (C.2C:20-10.1), the standalone auto theft statute.  Under the bill, aggravated assault is expanded to include injury caused at any time during an auto theft as well as joyriding. Aggravated assault pursuant to paragraph (6) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1 is a crime of the second degree. A crime of the second degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of five to 10 years, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.  A crime of the first degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.  However, murder is specifically subject to a term of imprisonment of 30 years without parole, or 30 years to life with a mandatory minimum of 30 years. Clarification of the strict liability nature of aggravated manslaughter and aggravated assault, even when the injury or death was actually caused by a police officer in pursuit of the defendant, conforms the statutes with State v. Lora, 465 N.J. Super. 477, 496 (App. Div. 2020), certif. denied, 246 N.J. 224 (2021), which held that, A police-related injury in the pursuit of a criminal is a risk created by that criminal, and we should not allow him to escape liability for his behavior.

(1) A person is guilty of assault by auto or vessel when the person drives a vehicle or vessel recklessly and causes either serious bodily injury or bodily injury to another.  Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the fourth degree if serious bodily injury results and is a disorderly persons offense if bodily injury results.  Proof that the defendant was operating a hand-held wireless telephone while driving a motor vehicle in violation of section 1 of P.L.2003, c.310 (C.39:4-97.3) may give rise to an inference that the defendant was driving recklessly. (2)   Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the third degree if the person drives the vehicle while in violation of R.S.39:4-50 or section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a) and serious bodily injury results and is a crime of the fourth degree if the person drives the vehicle while in violation of R.S.39:4-50 or section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a) and bodily injury results.

It shall be no defense to a prosecution for a violation of subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that the defendant was unaware that the prohibited conduct took place while on or within 1,000 feet of any school property or while driving through a school crossing.  Nor shall it be a defense to a prosecution under subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that no juveniles were present on the school property or crossing zone at the time of the offense or that the school was not in session. (4)   Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the third degree if the person purposely drives a vehicle in an aggressive manner directed at another vehicle and serious bodily injury results and is a crime of the fourth degree if the person purposely drives a vehicle in an aggressive manner directed at another vehicle and bodily injury results. For purposes of this paragraph, driving a vehicle in an aggressive manner shall include, but is not limited to, unexpectedly altering the speed of the vehicle, making improper or erratic traffic lane changes, disregarding traffic control devices, failing to yield the right of way, or following another vehicle too closely.

(cf: P.L.2024, c.94, s.1) 4. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the felony murder, aggravated manslaughter, and aggravated assault statutes to include death or bodily injury occurring during the commission of an auto theft. Under current law, paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:11-3 generally defines what is commonly known as the felony murder rule as a homicide occurring when the defendant is engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery, sexual assault, arson, burglary, kidnapping, carjacking, criminal escape, or terrorism, and in the course of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom, the defendant causes the death of another.  Under the bill, auto theft is added to the list of crimes to which the felony murder rule would apply.  Felony murder is a crime of the first degree, and is subject to sentencing enhancements specific to murder. Under current law, paragraph (2) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:11-4 defines aggravated manslaughter as a homicide occurring when the defendant causes the death of another while fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer. Aggravated manslaughter is a strict liability crime which does not require the prosecutor to prove that the defendant was reckless or intoxicated, and the defendant is liable even if the death was actually caused by a pursuing police officer. Under the bill, aggravated manslaughter is expanded to include death while driving a stolen motor vehicle at any time, whether or not the defendant was attempting to flee the police.  Aggravated manslaughter is a crime of the first degree. Under current law, pursuant to paragraph (6) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1, aggravated assault includes causing bodily injury to another while fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer, or while operating a motor vehicle in violation of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:20-10 (commonly known as the joyriding statute).  Aggravated assault is a strict liability crime which does not require the prosecutor to prove that the defendant was reckless or intoxicated, and the defendant is liable even if the injury was actually caused by a pursuing police officer.  This section of law was not updated to reflect the recent enactment of section 1 of P.L.2023, c.101 (C.2C:20-10.1), the standalone auto theft statute.  Under the bill, aggravated assault is expanded to include injury caused at any time during an auto theft as well as joyriding. Aggravated assault pursuant to paragraph (6) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1 is a crime of the second degree. A crime of the second degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of five to 10 years, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.  A crime of the first degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.  However, murder is specifically subject to a term of imprisonment of 30 years without parole, or 30 years to life with a mandatory minimum of 30 years. Clarification of the strict liability nature of aggravated manslaughter and aggravated assault, even when the injury or death was actually caused by a police officer in pursuit of the defendant, conforms the statutes with State v. Lora, 465 N.J. Super. 477, 496 (App. Div. 2020), certif. denied, 246 N.J. 224 (2021), which held that, A police-related injury in the pursuit of a criminal is a risk created by that criminal, and we should not allow him to escape liability for his behavior.
