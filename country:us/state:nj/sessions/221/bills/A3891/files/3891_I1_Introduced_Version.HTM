the beard, mustache, or other facial hair; and (3) massaging, cleansing, or

apprenticeship is two years. To be a barbering or general barbering apprentice,
an individual has to show proof of being at least 17 years of age, of good
moral character, and of being free of any communicable, contagious or
infectious disease. A shop approved by the board to host an apprenticeship is
to meet requirements established in current law and in the bill in regards to
licensure as a shop and the employment of the proper professionals to oversee
the management of the shop. An apprenticeship, under the bill, can be for an
individual seeking a barbering license or a general barbering license. Upon
completion of the apprenticeship, an individual is given the option to apply
for licensure by the board. </p>
