(cf: P.L.2007, c.131, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall be applicable to all offenses occurring on or after the effective date of this act. A prosecution for an offense committed prior to the effective date of P.L.     , c.      (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be governed by the five-year statute of limitations as it was set forth in N.J.S.2C:1-6 prior to the effective date of P.L.     , c.      (pending before the Legislature as this bill). STATEMENT This bill increases the statute of limitations for vehicular homicide. Under current law, vehicular homicide is a crime of the first degree if the defendant was driving while intoxicated on school property; otherwise it is a crime of the second degree. Generally, the prosecution of a first, second, third, and fourth degree crime is to be commenced within five years after the crime is committed. Therefore, prosecution for first and second degree vehicular homicide is to be commenced within five years. This bill would increase the current five-year limitation on prosecuting vehicular homicide to 10 years. Under the bill, this 10-year statute of limitations would only apply to vehicular homicide offenses committed after the bills effective date.
