issued to the district within 60 days after the department receives each
monthly invoice and accounting statement submitted by the district pursuant to
subsection h. of section 2 of this act.  The amount of each such installment

roll-over of awarded program grant funds from one year to the next shall be
prohibited, except as otherwise authorized pursuant to subsection e. of this

school districts in the State, as necessary to allow such districts to
implement or undertake expanded or modified local food procurement policies,
standards, processes, systems, and activities at their own pace, and to
whatever extent that such policies, standards, processes, systems, and
activities are capable of being so expanded or modified, as may be necessary to
increase the total number or type of local foods being procured for students,
the meal periods during which such local foods are served to students, or the
total number or type of students being offered such local foods, during either
the school year or the summer months, or both.  A school district would be
eligible for a program grant if all of the schools participating in, or
directly benefitting from, the districts expanded or modified local food
procurement policies, standards, processes, systems, or activities (i.e.,
participating schools) are schools that provide subsidized meals to eligible

an annual program grant of not less than $10,000 and not more than $50,000; (2)
a medium-sized school district, which has not less than 5,000 and not more than
10,000 students enrolled at participating schools, would be eligible to receive
an annual program grant of not less than $20,000 and not more than $125,000;

participating schools, would be eligible to receive an annual program grant of
not less than $44,000 and not more than $250,000. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A school district that wishes
to obtain a program grant would be required to submit an application as
prescribed by the secretary.  Among other things, the grant application would
be required to:  (1) identify the total number and percentage of schools, in
the district, that will be participating in grant-funded local food sourcing
and procurement activities; (2) identify the total number of students enrolled
at participating schools in the district, and, based on such enrollment
numbers, indicate whether the applicant district constitutes a small district,
a medium-sized district, or a large district, for the purposes of funding
determinations being made pursuant to the bill; (3) indicate the total amount
of the grant award being sought by the district, within the appropriate minimum
and maximum funding range established by the bill; (4) indicate whether the
district, or any participating school therein, is located in a food desert

local food products that the district proposes to source and procure for
students, including the name and address of each farm or other local food
producer from which the local foods will be sourced.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Of the program grant funds
annually awarded to an eligible school district:  (1) at least 80 percent of

district-operated or third party-contracted food service providers or vendors,
in sourcing and procuring the increased types or numbers of local foods that

ineligible costs, or any eligible costs that are already being paid for or
reimbursed with other State or federal funds.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Program grant funds also may
not be awarded in a single, lump-sum payment, but are to be disbursed to the
recipient school district on a rolling, term-limited, monthly installment
basis, over the course of a single-year commencing on September 1 and ending on
July 31 next following the date on which the program grant is awarded, and
using a draw-down process that provides for reimbursement checks to be issued
to the district within 60 days after the department receives a monthly invoice
and accounting statement submitted by the district.  Each monthly invoice and
accounting statement is to include appropriate receipts, photos, or other
documentation verifying the expenditures being accounted for therein, as well
as a brief explanation detailing why such expenditures should be deemed to
constitute eligible costs for the purposes of program reimbursement.  Any
program grant funds that are disbursed to a school district may be further
allocated, by the district, to participating schools, or to district-operated

reimburse the eligible costs being expended thereby, as documented in the
districts most recent invoice and accounting statement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Except as otherwise provided
by the bill, any program grant funds that are awarded to a school district, but
which remain unclaimed at the end of the annual disbursement period, are to be
reclaimed by the secretary and used to finance future grant awards under the
program.  An eligible school district that receives a program grant in one year
may apply for another program grant in any subsequent year.  However, the
roll-over of awarded program grant funds from one year to the next would be
prohibited, except in the case of hardship beyond the districts control.  In
that instance, the secretary may authorize any remaining grant fund balance to
be rolled-over and used by the district, for the same purposes, in the next
school year, subject to the same rolling disbursement requirements applicable
to the original grant award.  Any school district applying for such roll-over
funding would be required to submit documentation sufficient to establish that
the districts failure to expend the full amount of the grant award, during the
first annual disbursement period, was the result of a reasonable, valid, and
unexpected hardship outside the districts control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would appropriate
$6,500,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Agriculture for the
bills purposes.  Of that amount, $5,500,000 would be dedicated for use in
funding grant awards pursuant to the Farm to School Local Food Procurement
Reimbursement Grant Program and $1,000,000 would be dedicated for use in
financing the departments administrative costs. </p>
