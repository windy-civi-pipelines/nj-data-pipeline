heat exchanger, a groundwater thermal exchange device, or a submerged closed loop

shall provide a fixed-rate, monthly incentive to the owner of the geothermal
energy system, which is proportionate to the environmental and peak demand

pursuant to the provisions of sections 42 through 45 of P.L.1999, c.23
(C.48:3-91 through C.48:3-94).  The board shall determine the eligibility and
ranking criteria for the program, and the form and manner by which
municipalities and counties may apply for the program.  The board may use funds
collected through the societal benefits charge imposed pursuant to section 12
of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-60) in order to fund the grant program established
pursuant to this section.</p>

starting date for the implementation of retail choice as determined by the board
pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-53), the board
shall permit each electric public utility and gas public utility to recover
some or all of the following costs through a societal benefits charge that
shall be collected as a non-bypassable charge imposed on all electric public
utility customers and gas public utility customers, as appropriate:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) The costs for the social
programs for which rate recovery was approved by the board prior to April 30,
1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to
section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be
set to recover the same level of social program costs as is being collected in
the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of
P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  The board may subsequently order, pursuant
to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits
charge to reflect changes in the costs to the utility of administering existing
social programs.  Nothing in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) shall be
construed to abolish or change any social program required by statute or board
order or rule or regulation to be provided by an electric public utility.  Any
such social program shall continue to be provided by the utility until
otherwise provided by law, unless the board determines that it is no longer
appropriate for the electric public utility to provide the program, or the
board chooses to modify the program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  The costs of demand side

management regulations prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of

(C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same
level of demand side management program costs as is being collected in the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
direct the BPU to establish an incentive program for persons who own and

environmental and peak demand reduction benefits provided by the system.  The BPU
would be authorized to establish the amounts of the incentives, provided that
they are commensurate with the value of SREC-IIs provided under P.L.2021, c.169

negotiate with third-party energy providers to provide electricity or natural
gas to their residents at a lower rate, or with a higher mix of renewable
energy sources, than could normally have been achieved by the individual
customer.  The bill would authorize the BPU to utilize funds collected through
the societal benefits charge to fund the grants.</p>
