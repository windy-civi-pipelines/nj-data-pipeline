(2)   In the event that 50% of the sum of the school district of residence budget year equalization aid per pupil and the prebudget year general fund tax levy per pupil inflated by the CPI rate most recent to the calculation is less than the school district of residence budget year adjustment aid per pupil, the school district of residence shall pay directly to the charter school for each student enrolled in the charter school who resides in the district an amount equal to 60% of the sum of the budget year equalization aid per pupil, adjustment aid per pupil, and the prebudget year general fund tax levy per pupil inflated by the CPI rate most recent to the calculation. c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.260). d.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b. of this section, in the case of a student who was not included in the district's projected resident enrollment for the school year, the State shall pay 100% of the amount required pursuant to subsection b. of this section for the first year of the student's enrollment in the charter school. e.     The State shall make payments required pursuant to subsection d. of this section directly to the charter school. (cf: P.L.2007, c.260, s.58) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall first be applicable to the first school year beginning after the date of enactment. STATEMENT Under current law, a school district of residence forwards a portion of its revenue to a charter school for each of its resident students enrolled in the charter school.  Specifically, the district forwards an amount equal to 90 percent of the sum of its budget year equalization aid per pupil and prebudget year general fund tax levy per pupil, increased by the CPI.  The school district of residence is not required to forward any portion of its adjustment aid to a charter school; in some cases, this leads to a situation in which the charter school receives substantially less per pupil funding than the school district of residence. This bill specifies that if the sum of 50 percent of the equalization aid per pupil and general fund tax levy per pupil is less than the school district of residences adjustment aid per pupil, then the district would be required to transfer to the charter school 60 percent of the sum of the budget year equalization aid per pupil, adjustment aid per pupil, and prebudget year general fund tax levy per pupil inflated by the CPI.
