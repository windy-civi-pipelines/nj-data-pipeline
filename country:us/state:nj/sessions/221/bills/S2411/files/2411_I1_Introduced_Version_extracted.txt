Specifically, the bill requires that each voting machine be able to produce an individual permanent paper record for each vote cast, which must be made available for inspection and verification by the voter at the time the vote is cast, and preserved for later use in any manual audit. The bill also provides that the Secretary of State may waive the voter-verifiable paper record requirement for voting machines that were in use during an election in this State prior to the bills effective date.  However, the bill prohibits the Secretary of State from granting any such waiver for voting machines that were newly-purchased or leased following the bills effective date.
