The bills provisions increasing the tax rates for cigarettes, liquid nicotine, and container e-liquid would take effect on August 1, 2025. The bill would also require inventory reports and the payment of higher rates of tax on the inventories of these products by distributors, wholesalers, and retail suppliers in the State for the time at which the tax rate increases go into effect. Lastly, the bill would dedicate $2 million of revenue collected from the taxes imposed on liquid nicotine and container e-liquid to the States Health Care Subsidy Fund.  Under current law, the fund, administered by the Department of Health, annually receives dedicated revenues from a portion of the revenues collected annually from the cigarette tax, as well as the tobacco products wholesale sales and use tax. This bill would add a portion of the revenues collected from the taxes on liquid nicotine and container e-liquid as a dedicated revenue source for the fund.
