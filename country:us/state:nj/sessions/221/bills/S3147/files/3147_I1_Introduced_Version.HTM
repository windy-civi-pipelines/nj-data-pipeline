by the department, is approved by the department, consolidates beverage
containers subject to the requirements of this chapter through bulk sorting,
collects data regarding each container sorted, provides electronic data reports
specifying the number of containers sorted by universal product code along with
information regarding the container brand, redemption location and container
material type to support an accounting of deposits, fees, and material weight
and prepares the sorted containers for sale to recyclers. An account-based bulk
processing program may include a bag drop program as a program component.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Bag drop program&quot; means
a beverage container recycling program implemented by a redemption center that
meets the requirements of rules adopted by the department and that allows a
person to drop off beverage containers subject to the requirements of this
chapter in a bag or other receptacle at one or more identi&#64257;ed locations
and to have the corresponding refund placed into an account to be held for the
bene&#64257;t of the person in a manner that allows the person to obtain the refund
or a refund receipt within 10 calendar days following the drop-off.  A bag-drop
program may be implemented as part of, or in conjunction with an account-based
bulk processing program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Beverage means any drinkable

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Beverage container or
container means a prepackaged container, such as a bottle, can, carton,
pouch, or aseptic packaging which:  is made of any material or combination of
materials, including, but not limited to, glass, plastic, paper, cardboard, or metal;
contains a beverage; and has a volume of not more than one gallon.  Beverage
container or container shall not include a beverage cup.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Brand means a word, name,
symbol, trademark, group of letters, or any combination thereof, which is
adopted and used by a manufacturer to identify a specific flavor or type of
beverage, and to distinguish that flavor or type from another beverage being
produced or marketed by that manufacturer or by another manufacturer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Certified as reusable means
that a beverage container is officially recognized, by the department, as being
reusable in nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Container deposit or
deposit means a $0.10 deposit surcharge, equaling the refund value of a
container, which surcharge:  is originated by a distributor on each filled
beverage container sold or offered for sale in this State; is paid by the
dealer and by the consumer of the beverage, upon sale and delivery of the
filled beverage container thereto; and may be refunded to the consumer and the
dealer, as appropriate, upon the consumers or dealers return of the empty
beverage container.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Container refund or refund

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, to be known as the
Beverage Container Deposit Act, would establish a container deposit and
refund system in New Jersey to facilitate the return of used and empty beverage
containers to manufacturers for reuse, recycling, or proper disposal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commencing two years after the
date of the bills enactment, every filled beverage container sold or offered
for sale in the State would need to:  (1) be a returnable container; (2) have a
refund value of $0.10 when empty; (3) be clearly identified by a stamp, label,
or other mark securely affixed to the container, bearing the name of the State,
and indicating the containers refund value; and (4) if composed primarily of
metal, have no part that becomes detached when opened.  Any manufacturer who
manufactures for sale in this State, any distributor who sells, offers for
sale, or gives to a dealer in the State, and any dealer who sells, offers for
sale, or gives to a consumer in this State, a filled beverage container that
fails to comply with these requirements will be subject to a civil penalty of
$100 to $1,000, for each day of violation, as well as the payment of
restitution in an amount equal to the loss resulting from the violation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the container deposit
and refund system established in the bill, a distributor (including a
manufacturer or other person) who sells a filled beverage container to a dealer
in the State will be required to originate a $0.10 refundable container deposit
surcharge on that container, which is to be paid by the dealer and collected
and recorded by the distributor.  A dealer who sells a filled beverage
container to a consumer will then be required to charge the consumer the $0.10
deposit that was originated by the distributor on the container.  The bill
would not require a dealer to collect a deposit from a consumer who is
purchasing the beverage for on-site consumption in the dealers sale and
consumption area; however, if a dealer elects to authorize on-site beverage
consumption without payment of a deposit, the dealer will nonetheless be
required to collect a deposit if the consumer fails to return the container
upon leaving the sale and consumption area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A distributor or dealer who fails
to originate or impose the $0.10 deposit on a beverage container, as required
by the bill, will be subject to a civil penalty of $100 to $1,000, for each day
of violation, as well as the payment of restitution in an amount equal to the
loss resulting from the violation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require a
dealer to accept for return, from any person, an empty returnable container of
any kind, size, and brand that is sold or offered for sale by the dealer, and
to pay the containers refund value, in cash, to the person returning the
container, regardless of whether that person is the original customer who
purchased the filled container or whether the filled container was originally
sold by the dealer.  A dealer may limit, to $25, the total dollar amount of
container refunds that may be daily issued to a single person.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A distributor would similarly
be required to accept for return, from any dealer, an empty returnable
container of any kind, size, and brand that is sold or offered for sale by the
distributor, and to pay the dealer the full refund value of the container, in
cash.  The distributor would then be required to either return the redeemed
empty container to the manufacturer or, if the distributor is the manufacturer,
to retain possession of the redeemed container, for reuse, recycling, or proper
disposal in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would prohibit any
person from paying, claiming, or receiving any container deposit, refund,
processing payment, or handling fee for any of the following:  (1) a beverage
container that the person knows, or should know, was imported from out of
State; (2) a previously redeemed beverage container; (3) a previously rejected
beverage container; or (4) any other vessel, cup, non-beverage container, or
other material that is ineligible for redemption pursuant to this act.  The
bill would further prohibit any person from fraudulently:  (1) redeeming or
attempting to redeem an out-of-state container, a previously redeemed
container, a previously rejected container, or any other ineligible container
or material; (2) returning a previously redeemed container to the marketplace
for redemption purposes; (3) bringing an out-of-state container, a previously
rejected container, or any other ineligible container or material to the
marketplace for redemption purposes; or (4) receiving, storing, transporting,
distributing, or otherwise facilitating or aiding in the redemption of any such
ineligible container or material.  Any person who violates these provisions
would be subject to the payment of restitution in an amount equal to the loss
resulting from the violation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to facilitate the
return of beverage containers under the bill, the bill would require each
dealer who sells filled returnable beverage containers for off-site consumption
to provide, either on the premises where sales are made or within 100 yards
thereof, a reverse vending machine or other convenient means by which empty
returnable containers may be returned and a cash refund issued to the person
who is returning them.  The bill would additionally require a dealer to post
written notice, in the area where returnable containers are redeemed, notifying
consumers that they may be liable for the payment of restitution in association
with any improper container returns made thereby.  Any dealer who fails to
comply with either of these requirements would be subject to a civil penalty of
$50 per day of violation.  Certain manufacturers of large quantities of beverages
would also be required to use returnable containers that have a designated
symbol, mark, or other distinguishing characteristic, approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), which is sufficient to enable a
reverse vending machine to determine whether the container is returnable and is
eligible for a refund.  A manufacturer who does not use designated containers
when required by the Department of the Treasury would be subject to a civil
penalty of up to $2,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bills provisions,
if a distributor, in a single year, is an under-redeemer of beverage
containers, meaning that the distributor has collected more money in container
deposits than the distributor has expended in container refunds, the
distributor will be required to pay, to the Department of the Treasury, the
value of the unclaimed deposits, less the value of any over-redemption credit
authorized under the bill.  An over-redemption credit may be issued, by the
Department of the Treasury, to any distributor who, in a single year, expends
more money in container refunds than the distributor collects through deposits,
and this credit may be carried forward for the next three years to offset any
payments owed by the distributor upon becoming an under-redeemer.  However, if
an over-redeemer is not planning to continue making container deposits in
subsequent years, the Department of the Treasury may allow the over-redeemer,
on a one-time basis, to carry the value of the credit back into prior years in
order to realize its value.  In order to reduce the costs owed by an
under-redeemer and reduce the amounts expended by an over-redeemer, the bill
would authorize an under-redeemer to purchase empty redeemed containers from
another distributor who is an over-redeemer in the same year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the DEP
to authorize and provide for the establishment, licensure, and operation of
beverage container redemption centers, throughout the State, for the bills
purposes.  Each such redemption center would be authorized to engage in the
bulk collection of redeemable containers, in accordance with various
requirements established in the bill, through the use of either or both an
account-based bulk processing program or a bag-drop program, as such programs
are defined in the bill.  Except as otherwise provided by the bill, each such
redemption center would be required to remain open and available to accept
redeemable containers on a daily basis, seven days a week, for at least 10
hours a day from Monday through Saturday, and for at least six hours a day on
Sunday.  The redemption centers established and operated, pursuant to the bill,
are to supplement, but not supplant, the consumer return of redeemable
containers to dealers under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would further require
each distributor of beverages, unless otherwise speci&#64257;ed in a contract
executed with a dealer, to offer to provide a collection service, for
redeemable containers, to each dealer or other establishment that allows for
the on-site consumption of beverages in the State.  Such collection service is
to provide for the regular collection of all redeemable containers stored by
such dealers and other establishments, in accordance with the following collection
schedule:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   if the dealer or other
establishment has an on-site consumption capacity of 50 or more persons at a
time, the collection system is to provide for all redeemable containers stored thereby,
at least once per week; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   if the dealer or other
establishment has an on-site consumption capacity of fewer than 50 persons at a
time, the collection system is to provide for all redeemable containers stored thereby
to be collected, by the distributor, at least twice per month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A distributor operating a
collection system, pursuant to the bill, would be required to:  (1) provide all
of equipment and accessories necessary to facilitate the collection of
redeemable containers under the system; (2) take appropriate and necessary
steps to ensure that redeemable beverage containers are emptied and sorted on
site, if possible; (3) issue appropriate refunds, for all redeemable containers
collected under the system, not more than seven consecutive business days after
such containers are collected; and (4) if the distributor requires the use of a
digital application to facilitate the issuance of requisite refunds, assign a
unique identi&#64257;cation code to each participating dealer or other
establishment and require each such dealer or other establishment to attach, to
each container stored thereby, a label containing that identification code.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would establish four
new funds for the moneys that will be obtained through the implementation of
the bills provisions:  (1) the Beverage Container Deposit Fund; (2) the
Beverage Container Deposit Enforcement Fund; (3) the Clean-Up and Redevelopment
Trust Fund; and (4) the Community Pollution Prevention Grant Fund.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Moneys that are paid by
under-redeemers, pursuant to the bill, are to be deposited into the Beverage Container
Deposit Fund.  The first $1 million in the BCD Fund is to be annually disbursed
to the Beverage Container Deposit Enforcement Fund for use by the State Police
in enforcing, and investigating violations of, the bills provisions.  However,
if the balance in the Enforcement Fund exceeds $3 million, disbursements to
that fund will be suspended until the balance falls below $2 million.  Of the
amounts remaining in the Deposit Fund following the requisite disbursement to
the Enforcement Fund, 75 percent is to be disbursed to the Clean-Up and
Redevelopment Trust Fund, and 25 percent is to be apportioned to each dealer in
the State, based on the number of empty returnable containers handled by each
dealer.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to the moneys
disbursed thereto from the Beverage Container Deposit Fund, the Clean-Up and
Redevelopment Trust Fund would also be credited with all penalty and
restitution amounts that are imposed and collected by a court for violations of
the bills provisions.  For each of the three fiscal years next following the
bills effective date, the first $15 million annually deposited in the trust
fund is to be disbursed, in equal amounts, to eight different clean-up and
redevelopment funds currently existing in the State and identified in the
bill.  Of the moneys remaining in the trust fund in those first three fiscal
years, and of the total sum of moneys deposited in the trust fund in the fourth
and each subsequent fiscal year following the bills effective date, 80 percent
of such moneys are to be equally disbursed, on an annual basis, to the eight
different clean-up and redevelopment funds identified in the bill, and 10
percent of such moneys are to be disbursed to the Community Pollution
Prevention Grant Fund, newly established pursuant to the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Moneys in the Community
Pollution Prevention Grant Fund are to be used, by the DEP, to provide grants
to local governments, local health departments, regional planning agencies, and
similar entities (in amounts of up to $100,000 per year for each recipient) to
finance various programs and activities related to water pollution prevention
and litter clean-up, as specified in the bill.  Each grant recipient would be
required to provide a financial match equaling 25 to 50 percent of the grant
award.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, this bill would
repeal section 5 of P.L.2007, c.311 (C.13:1E-96.6), which currently provides
for the States existing recycling tax to become inoperable if State or federal
law requires a deposit on, or establishes a refund value, for a beverage
container, as this bill would do.  This repeal will ensure that the States
existing recycling tax continues to remain in effect, notwithstanding this
bills enactment. </p>
