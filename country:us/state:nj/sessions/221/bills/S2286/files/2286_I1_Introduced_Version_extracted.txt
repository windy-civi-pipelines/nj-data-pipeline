Once the agreement is established, a State licensee is permitted to engage in commercial cannabis activity with a foreign licensee, i.e., the holder of a commercial cannabis license issued under the laws of another state.  In order for the agreement to become effective, the bill requires that one of the following occur: (1) federal law is amended to allow for the interstate transfer of cannabis or cannabis products between authorized commercial cannabis businesses; (2) federal law is enacted that specifically prohibits the expenditure of federal funds to prevent the interstate transfer of cannabis or cannabis products between authorized commercial cannabis businesses; (3) the United States Department of Justice issues an opinion or memorandum allowing or tolerating the interstate transfer of cannabis products between authorized commercial cannabis businesses; or (4) the Attorney General issues a written opinion that implementation of agreements entered into pursuant to the provisions of this bill will not result in significant legal risk to this State based on review of federal judicial decisions and administrative action. Prior to making any agreement, the Governor is required to submit the proposed agreement to the Joint Budget Oversight Committee which will have 60 days to review the proposed agreement. The committee may submit a recommendation to the Governor upon agreement of the majority of the members.  The proposed agreement also is required to be posted on the Governors and Cannabis Regulatory Commissions internet websites for public comment for a period of 30 days.
