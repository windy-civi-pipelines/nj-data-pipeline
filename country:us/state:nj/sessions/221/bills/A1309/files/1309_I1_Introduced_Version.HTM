or where continued enforcement of the contract may result in extreme hardship, the executive director may nullify or suspend the program participants employment obligation. 11.  The Executive Director of the authority shall adopt in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 12.  This act shall take effect for the 2012-2013 academic year; however, the authority may immediately take such administrative action as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act. STATEMENT This bill establishes the New Jersey Talent Retention Loan and Loan Redemption Program within the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA).  The goal of the program is to keep the most talented students in New Jersey from leaving the State during college or at the beginning of their working career.  The program is a financial aid program that offers certain New Jersey high school students who attend college in New Jersey, loans of up to $10,000 per year and up to a $40,000 maximum, and then forgiveness of those loans in exchange for employment with certain New Jersey companies.  The companies that are eligible under this program to employ students are the companies that provide the funding for the loan program through donations to the New Jersey Talent Retention Loan Fund which is also established in HESAA. Employers that contribute to the loan fund are eligible to take a tax credit equal to 50% of the amount contributed in the taxable year of the contribution.  Contributions to the loan fund will be used to fund loans for eligible students.  The employer is eligible to take an additional tax credit equal to 50% of the contribution by employing students who have received loans under the program upon their graduation.  For every $40,000 contributed to the loan fund, an employer may select a student who receives a loan under the program and that student is then contractually obligated to apply to and accept an offer of employment with that company before he is eligible to accept employment with any other company that has made a contribution. A student who wants to participate in the program must submit an application to HESAA.  HESAA will accept students in accordance with standards of academic merit that it is directed to establish under the bill.  The accepted students will be placed on a qualified applicants list.  Employers and HESAA will then select from among the qualified applicants list to decide which students will be admitted into the program.  Companies that contribute the greatest amount to the loan fund will select first and then other companies will make selections in descending order of contribution amount until all monies in the loan fund for that year have been disbursed. A student admitted to the program will then be eligible for a loan from HESAA of up to $10,000 per year with a maximum amount of $40,000 for a baccalaureate degree program and $20,000 for an associate degree program.  After graduation, the student must obtain employment with one of the employers that contributed to the loan fund.  If the participant does not obtain employment with a qualified employer within 18 months of graduation, the participant will have to begin paying back the loans.  If the participant does find employment with a qualified employer, the student will have 25% of the loan amount redeemed for every 12 months of full time employment, until the loan is completely forgiven.

STATEMENT This bill establishes the New Jersey Talent Retention Loan and Loan Redemption Program within the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA).  The goal of the program is to keep the most talented students in New Jersey from leaving the State during college or at the beginning of their working career.  The program is a financial aid program that offers certain New Jersey high school students who attend college in New Jersey, loans of up to $10,000 per year and up to a $40,000 maximum, and then forgiveness of those loans in exchange for employment with certain New Jersey companies.  The companies that are eligible under this program to employ students are the companies that provide the funding for the loan program through donations to the New Jersey Talent Retention Loan Fund which is also established in HESAA. Employers that contribute to the loan fund are eligible to take a tax credit equal to 50% of the amount contributed in the taxable year of the contribution.  Contributions to the loan fund will be used to fund loans for eligible students.  The employer is eligible to take an additional tax credit equal to 50% of the contribution by employing students who have received loans under the program upon their graduation.  For every $40,000 contributed to the loan fund, an employer may select a student who receives a loan under the program and that student is then contractually obligated to apply to and accept an offer of employment with that company before he is eligible to accept employment with any other company that has made a contribution. A student who wants to participate in the program must submit an application to HESAA.  HESAA will accept students in accordance with standards of academic merit that it is directed to establish under the bill.  The accepted students will be placed on a qualified applicants list.  Employers and HESAA will then select from among the qualified applicants list to decide which students will be admitted into the program.  Companies that contribute the greatest amount to the loan fund will select first and then other companies will make selections in descending order of contribution amount until all monies in the loan fund for that year have been disbursed. A student admitted to the program will then be eligible for a loan from HESAA of up to $10,000 per year with a maximum amount of $40,000 for a baccalaureate degree program and $20,000 for an associate degree program.  After graduation, the student must obtain employment with one of the employers that contributed to the loan fund.  If the participant does not obtain employment with a qualified employer within 18 months of graduation, the participant will have to begin paying back the loans.  If the participant does find employment with a qualified employer, the student will have 25% of the loan amount redeemed for every 12 months of full time employment, until the loan is completely forgiven.
