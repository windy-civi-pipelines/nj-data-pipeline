fulfill education requirements by 1) obtaining a baccalaureate or higher degree
or its equivalent or 2) successfully completing 150 hours of education.  The
educational program is to include a concentration in accounting or its
equivalent and other related professional courses as prescribed by the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also removes
substantial equivalence as the standard to be met for out-of-State individuals
and instead requires comparable standards to be met, among other items, for the
individual to receive a New Jersey license.  Additionally, the bill removes the
need to meet standards established by the National Association of State Boards
of Accountancy in order to qualify for licensure as an out-of-State
individual.  An individual is to, instead, hold a current valid and unrevoked
license in another U.S. jurisdiction; pass the Uniform Certified Public
Accountant Examination or any other examination approved by the board; and has
one year of experience as required by current law.  The bill further stipulates
that an individual who holds a current valid license from the other state prior
to December 31, 2025 and as of that date, has practice privileges in New Jersey
is allowed to continue having all the privileges of licensed certified public
accountants of the State without the need to obtain a license pursuant to the
other requirements of current law, to notify the board, or to pay any fee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Moreover, on experience, the
bill delineates the individuals who need to complete two years of certain
experience and one year.  Lastly, the bill also updates when examination
waivers apply to individuals.  </p>
