concerning the improved care of dogs, supplementing Title 2C of the New Jersey
Statutes and Title 4 of the Revised Statutes, and amending <span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>various sections of the statutory law.</span></p>

small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:
150%'> </span><i>by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     1.    (New
section)  Sections 1 through 8 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before
the Legislature as this bill) shall be known, and may be cited, as the Better
Care Dog Act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      2.   (New
section)  The Legislature finds and declares the following:  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      a.   There
is a need to address and prevent the negative behaviors of, and facilitate safe
human interactions with, dogs in the State.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      b.   Currently,
the behavior and care of dogs is inconsistently and haphazardly regulated,
across the State, through a complex system of local ordinances that vary from
municipality to municipality.  Some municipalities, moreover, have not adopted
any local ordinances to address the behavior or responsible care of vicious
dogs, potentially dangerous dogs, or other dogs residing in the municipality,
thereby resulting in a lack of guidance on these issues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      c.   While
State law does address how a dog is to be treated and penalized when the dog
engages in potentially dangerous or vicious behaviors, the law is silent on the
issue of whether and how a dog owner is to be held responsible for the
potentially dangerous or vicious behavior of a dog owned thereby.  Similarly,
while State law addresses what is to happen when a dog causes bodily injury to
a person, it does not address what is to occur when a dog has not caused bodily
injury, but roams free without a leash or other controls that are designed to
prevent the dog from causing bodily injury.  Specifically, the law provides no
guidance regarding whether and how dog owners are to act proactively to control
free-roaming dogs before those dogs cause bodily injury to another person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      d.   Children
are at particular risk when confronted by an unrestrained dog, due to their

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, to be known as the
Better Care Dog Act, would provide for the Department of Health, in
consultation with all relevant stakeholders, to establish a <span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>uniform Statewide system, which provides leashing
and fencing requirements designed to restrain the movement of free-roaming
dogs, and it would require all municipalities in the State to adopt ordinances
consistent with this Statewide system.  The bill would also clarify that
certain special requirements that are applicable, under existing State law, to
the owners of potentially dangerous dogs are also applicable to the owners of
vicious dogs that have not been ordered to be euthanized.  Finally, the bill
would establish new criminal offenses and penalties for dog owners whose
unrestrained dog attacks, injures, or kills another person, as well as civil
penalties for dog owners who fail to restrain their dogs when those dogs are
off the owners property.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     Specifically,
the bill would provide that, whenever a dog is off the property of its owner,
the dog will be required to be on a leash or otherwise controlled with another
appropriate restraint unless the owner is exempt from this requirement, as
provided by the bill or by any other rule, regulation, ordinance, or resolution
adopted by the State or a municipality pursuant thereto.  The bill would
expressly exempt, from its leashing requirements, any working or hunting dog
while the dog is engaged in agricultural work or hunting activities.  If a dog
owner is found, by clear and convincing evidence, to have allowed a dog to be
unrestrained while off the owners property, or to have violated any similar
provision of a municipal ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation concerning
dog leashing or restraints, the owner would be subject to a fine of $100 for
the first violation, $250 for the second violation, and $500 for the third and
any subsequent violation, regardless of whether the unrestrained dog attacked
or caused bodily injury to a person.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      Whenever
an unrestrained dog, while off the property of the owner, attacks a person
without causing bodily injury, the municipality would additionally be required
to issue a warning notice to the dog owner indicating that, in addition to any
applicable fines imposed for failing to restrain the dog, the owner may also be
required to comply with fencing requirements to control the dog, in the
discretion of the enforcing authority, in the event that the dog is again found
unrestrained and off the property of the owner after the issuance of the
warning notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
bill would further provide that, upon the third time a dog is found
unrestrained and off the owners property, or, in the discretion of the municipality,
the first time that the dog is found unrestrained and off the owners property
following the issuance of a warning notice for the dog, as described above, and
provided that the unrestrained dog has not attacked or caused bodily injury to
another person, the municipality will be required to order the owner to comply
with the fencing requirements established pursuant to the bill, including any
specifications for the installation of such fencing, in accordance with a
compliance schedule established by the municipality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      If
a dog owner is found, by clear and convincing evidence, to have violated a
municipal fencing order or compliance schedule, the owner would be subject to a
fine of $200 per day of the violation, with each days continuance of the
violation constituting a separate and distinct offense.  The municipality would
additionally be required to revoke any registration previously issued for the
dog.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
bills warning and fencing requirements would not apply in any case where:</span></p>

dog, while unrestrained and off the owners property, kills a person, causes
serious bodily injury to a person, or both causes bodily injury to a person
during an unprovoked attack and poses a serious threat of harm to other persons
or domestic animals, in which case, the dog and the dogs owner would be
subject to the applicable provisions of the States criminal code and vicious
and potentially dangerous dogs act;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (2)  the
dog owner is a resident of a condominium, townhouse, apartment, or other rental
property where the installation of fencing is impractical, or the owner is
otherwise exempt from fencing requirements established pursuant to the bill, in
which case, the municipality is to require the owner to pay a fine for the failure
to restrain the dog, in the amount described above, and may additionally
require the owner to comply with alternative enclosure requirements, to the
extent that such alternative enclosures are authorized by ordinance, rule,
regulation, or resolution of the municipality; or</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (3)  a
person, other than the owner, intentionally removed the dog from the owners
property, such as by walking the dog beyond the boundaries of the owners
property, taking the dog to a park or other public open space, or taking the
dog to the property of another person who is not the owner, and the dog, while
unrestrained and off the owners property, attacked a person without causing
bodily injury, in which case, the municipality is to require the owner to pay a
fine for failure to restrain the dog, in the amount described above, but may
not require the owner to comply with fencing or alternative enclosure
requirements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
municipal court would have jurisdiction to enforce the bills provisions, in
this regard, and to impose the fines described above.  Any fines collected
pursuant to the bill are to be paid to the municipality in which the violation
occurred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
bill requires the Department of Health, in consultation with the New Jersey
Certified Animal Control Officers Association, the League of Municipalities, and
the New Jersey Veterinary Medical Association, to adopt rules and regulations,
within 180 days after the bills effective date, to implement the bills
provisions related to the leashing and fencing of dogs.  Those rules and
regulations are to:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (1)  establish
standards and requirements, consistent with the bills provisions, governing

the circumstances or areas of the State in which a dog owner will be exempt

exemptions authorizing a dog to be unrestrained while exercising in a dog park;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (3)  establish
standards and requirements for fencing, which would apply when the fencing of a
dog is required pursuant to the bill.  These standards and requirements would,
at a minimum:  address the appropriate height and other dimensions of the
fencing; establish exemptions from fencing requirements; and identify acceptable
alternative enclosure options, if any, that may be used by residents of
condominiums, townhouses, apartments, and other rental properties where the
installation of fencing is impractical and by other dog owners who are exempt
from fencing requirements established under the bill; and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (4)  establish
any other requirements for the control and regulation of the free movement of
dogs, as deemed by the department to be appropriate, reasonable, and necessary
for the public health and safety.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     In
order to facilitate the enactment, across the State, of uniform municipal
ordinances addressing the leashing and fencing of free-roaming dogs, the
department would be required to adopt model ordinances, incorporating the
leashing and fencing standards and requirements adopted by the department,
which ordinances may then be adopted by municipalities pursuant to the bill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
bill would require each municipality, within 180 days after the department
publishes its rules and regulations, to:  adopt an ordinance, resolution, or
regulation that, at a minimum, incorporates the standards and requirements
established by the department and provides for the municipal enforcement of the
leashing and fencing provisions of the bill; and establish a dedicated fund to
finance the municipal enforcement of the bill, which fund is to be separate
from the other funds of the municipality.  The municipality would be authorized
to allocate to, and deposit in, the fund, moneys obtained from dog licenses and
other related fees, as well as monetary penalties collected pursuant to the
bill.  Moneys in the dedicated fund may be used for the following purposes
only:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (1)  to
facilitate the enforcement of any standard, requirement, law, ordinance,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (2)  to
publicize the provisions of the bill and the rules, regulations, ordinances, or
resolutions adopted thereunder; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (3)  to

that can be used by members of the public to report violations of the States
vicious and potentially dangerous dogs act and the Better Care Dog Act; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (4)  to
post signage related to vicious dogs, potentially dangerous dogs, or other dogs
registered in the municipality;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (5)  to
provide free or discounted leashes, collars, and other dog restraints to dog

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (6)  to
cover any other municipal expense incurred pursuant to this bill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      In
addition to providing for the establishment of a uniform, Statewide dog
leashing and fencing system, the bill would establish the following new
criminal offenses for dog owners whose unrestrained dog attacks or injures
another person while off the property of the owner:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (1)  Simple
assault, as a crime of the fourth degree, when a person purposefully,
knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained in a
residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space, or
purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly fails to comply with requirements
imposed by a court, pursuant to P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-17 et seq.), in
association with the persons ownership of a potentially dangerous dog or
vicious dog, and the dog, as a result of the owners actions, attacks and
causes bodily injury to another person;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (2)  Aggravated
assault, as a crime of the third degree, when a person purposefully, knowingly,
or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained in a residential
neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space, or purposefully,
knowingly, or recklessly fails to comply with requirements imposed by a court,
pursuant to P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-17 et seq.), in association with the
persons ownership of a potentially dangerous dog or vicious dog, and the dog,
as a result of the owners actions, attacks and causes serious bodily injury to
another person;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (3)  Criminal
homicide via death by dog, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly
allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained in a residential neighborhood,
park, or other publicly accessible open space, and the unrestrained dog kills
another person in an unprovoked attack;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (4)  Endangering
the welfare of a child, as a crime of the second degree, when a person
purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be
unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly
accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while
unrestrained, kills a child;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (5)  Endangering
the welfare of a child, as a crime of the third degree, when a person
purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be
unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly
accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while
unrestrained, causes serious bodily injury to a child;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (6)  Endangering
the welfare of a child, as a crime of the fourth degree, when a person
purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be
unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly
accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while
unrestrained, causes bodily injury to a child; and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (7)  Endangering
the welfare of a child, as a disorderly persons offense, when a person
purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be
unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible
open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while unrestrained,
attacks a child without causing bodily injury.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
bill would further provide that, in any prosecution undertaken pursuant to the
bills provisions, it will be an affirmative defense that the dog:  (1) was
provoked into attacking the victim; (2) was defending or protecting itself or
its offspring from injury or attack; or (3) was defending or protecting its
owner from injury or attack, provided that the owner was not, at the time,
engaged in a criminal offense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
bill would also amend the State law pertaining to potentially dangerous and
vicious dogs, in order to clarify that the laws special registration and
licensure requirements and enhanced dog care restrictions are equally
applicable both to potentially dangerous dogs and to vicious dogs that have not
been ordered euthanized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      Finally, the bill would
provide that, w<span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>henever a person registers or
licenses a dog with a municipality, the municipal clerk or other official issuing
the license will be required to provide the person with notice of:  the new
criminal offenses established by the bill; the provisions of the States
vicious and potentially dangerous dogs act; the provisions of sections 4 of
this bill, pertaining to dog leashing and fencing; and any other provisions,
adopted by ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of the State or
municipality, that govern the leashing, restraint, or movement of dogs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
provisions of the bill requiring the Department of Health to adopt rules and
regulations to implement the new, uniform dog leashing and fencing system, and
the provisions of the bill requiring each municipality in the State to adopt
ordinances, regulations, or resolutions consistent with that uniform Statewide
system, would each become effective immediately upon the bills enactment.  In
order to provide the department and each municipality with enough time to
complete the regulatory action needed to effectively implement the bill, the
remaining provisions of the bill would remain inoperable until the first day of
the first year next following the date of enactment.</span></p>
