A3320 ASSEMBLY, No. 3320 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  YVONNE LOPEZ District 19 (Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Better Care Dog Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the improved care of dogs, supplementing Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes and Title 4 of the Revised Statutes, and amending various sections of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  Sections 1 through 8 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known, and may be cited, as the Better Care Dog Act. 2.   (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares the following: a.   There is a need to address and prevent the negative behaviors of, and facilitate safe human interactions with, dogs in the State. b.   Currently, the behavior and care of dogs is inconsistently and haphazardly regulated, across the State, through a complex system of local ordinances that vary from municipality to municipality.  Some municipalities, moreover, have not adopted any local ordinances to address the behavior or responsible care of vicious dogs, potentially dangerous dogs, or other dogs residing in the municipality, thereby resulting in a lack of guidance on these issues. c.   While State law does address how a dog is to be treated and penalized when the dog engages in potentially dangerous or vicious behaviors, the law is silent on the issue of whether and how a dog owner is to be held responsible for the potentially dangerous or vicious behavior of a dog owned thereby.  Similarly, while State law addresses what is to happen when a dog causes bodily injury to a person, it does not address what is to occur when a dog has not caused bodily injury, but roams free without a leash or other controls that are designed to prevent the dog from causing bodily injury.  Specifically, the law provides no guidance regarding whether and how dog owners are to act proactively to control free-roaming dogs before those dogs cause bodily injury to another person. d.   Children are at particular risk when confronted by an unrestrained dog, due to their small stature in comparison to most dogs, and also due to their innocence, inexperience, and emotional perceptions. e.   The euthanasia of dogs that have evidenced vicious behaviors, as authorized by existing law, is appropriate in order to prevent the ongoing transfer of aggressive dogs from owner to owner, and the application of additional restrictions on the continued ownership of vicious dogs that are not ordered to be euthanized is necessary to protect the public from ongoing aggression from such dogs. f.    Dog owners generally embrace their role as caretakers and trainers of their dogs and are likely to be the first to wish to curtail any negative interactions between themselves, their dogs, children, and any other members of the communities in which they live. g.   Any regulation of dog behavior must be implemented with consideration, forethought, and reasonableness for the good of both the public and dog owners in the State. h.   By imposing leashing requirements for all dogs and fencing requirements for dogs that are repeatedly found off leash and outside the owners control; by subjecting a dog owner to criminal liability, and establishing specific guidelines for the prosecution of dog owners, when an unrestrained dog attacks or injures another person; and by subjecting a dog owner to civil penalties when the owners failure to engage in safe dog care causes a threat to public safety, the State can enhance the uniformity of regulations and promote consistency in prosecutorial decision making, across various jurisdictions, with respect to dog-related injuries and offenses, and better facilitate the well-being of children, other citizens, and dogs in the State in a manner that is consistent with accepted notions of responsible dog ownership to which so many, if not all, dog owners are committed and subscribe. i.    The Department of Health, acting in consultation and collaboration with all relevant stakeholders, is well positioned to develop and implement a Statewide regulatory system for safe dog care that will effectively enhance public health and safety while protecting the wellbeing of dogs in the State. j.    Based on the foregoing findings, the Legislature determines that it is reasonable and appropriate, and in the public interest, for the State to facilitate the public health and safety, as well as the improved care of dogs in the State, by: (1)  requiring the Department of Health to establish a uniform Statewide system, which provides leashing and fencing requirements designed to restrain the movement of free-roaming dogs; (2)  requiring all municipalities in the State to adopt ordinances consistent with the Statewide system established by the Department of Health; (3)  clarifying that the States special dog registration and licensure requirements apply both to potentially dangerous dogs and to vicious dogs that are not ordered to be euthanized; and (4)  establishing criminal and civil penalties for dog owners whose unrestrained dog attacks or injures another person, or who otherwise fails to engage in safe dog care, as required by P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and the rules, regulations, ordinances, and resolutions adopted pursuant thereto. 3.   (New section)  As used in sections 1 through 8 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Alternative enclosure means a type of enclosure, other than one created through the use of fencing, which can be used, by a dog owner who is otherwise exempt from the fencing requirements of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), to restrict the movement of an otherwise unrestrained dog while the dog is on the owners property but outside the walls of the owners home. Bodily injury means the same as that term is defined in N.J.S.2C:11-1. Department means the Department of Health. Owner means a person who owns the dog at issue. Serious bodily injury means the same as that term is defined in N.J.S.2C:11-1. Unrestrained means that a dog is off leash and not controlled by another appropriate restraint. 4. (New section)  a.  (1) Whenever a dog is off the property of the owner, the dog shall be on a leash or controlled with another appropriate restraint unless the owner is subject to an exemption from this requirement, as provided by paragraph (2) of this subsection or by any other rule, regulation, ordinance, or resolution adopted by the State or a municipality pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (2)  The requirements pertaining to dog leashing and other restraints, which are established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not apply to a working or hunting dog while the dog is engaged in agricultural work or hunting activities. (3)  If a dog owner is found, by clear and convincing evidence, to have allowed a dog to be unrestrained while off the owners property, in violation of the provisions of this subsection, or to have violated the provisions of any other, similar municipal ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation concerning the leashing or other restraint of a dog, the owner shall be subject to a fine of $100 for the first violation, $250 for the second violation, and $500 for the third and any subsequent violation, regardless of whether the unrestrained dog attacked or caused bodily injury to a person. b.   Whenever an unrestrained dog, while off the property of the owner, attacks a person without causing bodily injury, the municipality shall issue a warning notice to the dog owner indicating that, in addition to any applicable fines imposed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the owner may also be required to comply with fencing requirements to control the dog, in the discretion of the enforcing authority and pursuant to subsection c. of this section, in the event that the dog is again found unrestrained and off the property of the owner after the issuance of the warning notice. c.   (1) The third time a dog is found unrestrained and off the owners property, in violation of the provisions of subsection a. of this section, or, in the discretion of the municipality, the first time that the dog is found unrestrained and off the owners property following the issuance of a warning notice for the dog pursuant to subsection b. of this section, and provided that the dog, while so unrestrained, has not attacked or caused bodily injury to another person, the municipality shall order the owner to comply with the fencing requirements established pursuant to sections 6 and 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including any specifications for the installation of such fencing, in accordance with a compliance schedule established by the municipality. (2)  If a dog owner is found, by clear and convincing evidence, to have violated a municipal order or compliance schedule issued pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the owner shall be subject to a fine of $200 per day of the violation, with each days continuance of the violation constituting a separate and distinct offense, and the municipality shall revoke any registration previously issued for the dog. d.   The provisions of subsections b. and c. of this section shall not apply in any case where: (1)  the dog, while unrestrained and off the owners property, kills a person, causes serious bodily injury to a person, or both causes bodily injury to a person during an unprovoked attack and poses a serious threat of harm to other persons or domestic animals, in which case, the dog and the dogs owner shall be subject to the applicable provisions of, and penalties provided by, P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-17 et seq.), N.J.S.2C:11-2, N.J.S.2C:12-1, N.J.S.2C:24-4, and section 10 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (2)  the dog owner is a resident of a condominium, townhouse, apartment, or other rental property where the installation of fencing is impractical, or the dog owner is otherwise expressly exempt from fencing requirements established pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), in which case, the municipality shall require the owner to pay a fine, as provided in subsection a. of this section, and may additionally require the owner to comply with alternative enclosure requirements, to the extent that such alternative enclosures are authorized by ordinance, rule, regulation, or resolution of the municipality; or (3)  a person, other than the owner, intentionally removed the dog from the owners property, such as by walking the dog beyond the boundaries of the owners property, taking the dog to a park or other public open space, or taking the dog to the property of another person who is not the owner, and the dog, while unrestrained and off the owners property, attacked a person without causing bodily injury, in which case, the municipality shall require the owner to pay a fine, as provided by subsection a. of this section, but shall not require the owner to comply with any fencing or alternative enclosure requirements. e.   The fines imposed by this section shall be collected in a summary proceeding filed pursuant to the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10).  The municipal court shall have jurisdiction to enforce the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999 for the purposes of this section, and any fines collected shall be paid to the municipality in which the violation occurred. 5.   (New section)  Whenever a person registers or licenses a dog with a municipality pursuant to section 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.2, C.4:19-15.3, C.4:19-15.4, C.4:19-15.5, or C.4:19-15.6), or pursuant to section 14 or 15 of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-30 or C.4:19-31), the municipal clerk or other official issuing the license shall provide the person with notice of:  the provisions of N.J.S.2C:11-2, N.J.S.2C:12-1, and N.J.S.2C:24-4; the provisions of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-17 et seq.); the provisions of sections 4 and 10 of P.L. , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and any other provisions, adopted by ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of the State or municipality, that govern the leashing, restraint, or movement of dogs. 6.   (New section)  a.  Within 180 days after the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.  (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the Department of Health, in consultation with the New Jersey Certified Animal Control Officers Association, the League of Municipalities, and the New Jersey Veterinary Medical Association, shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to implement the provisions of the Better Care Dog Act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill.  The rules and regulations shall: (1)  establish standards and requirements, consistent with the provisions of subsection a. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), governing the leashing or other restraint of a dog when it is off the property of its owner; (2)  identify the circumstances or areas of the State in which a dog owner will be exempt from the restraint requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of section 4 of P.L.     , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including, but not limited to, exemptions authorizing a dog to be unrestrained while exercising in a dog park; (3)  establish standards and requirements for fencing, which shall apply when the fencing of a dog is required pursuant to subsection c. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.

In any prosecution under this paragraph, it is an affirmative defense that the dog:  (a) was provoked into attacking the victim; (b) was defending or protecting itself or its offspring from injury or attack; or (c) was defending or protecting its owner from injury or attack, provided that the owner was not, at the time, engaged in a criminal offense.

The municipal court shall have jurisdiction to enforce this section.  An animal control officer is authorized to seize and impound any potentially dangerous dog or vicious dog whose owner fails to comply with the provisions of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-17 et seq.)[,] or any rule or regulation adopted, or court order issued, pursuant thereto[, or a court's order]. The municipal court may order that the dog so seized and impounded be destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner. (cf:  P.L.1994, c.187, s.10) 18.  Section 14 of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-30) is amended to read as follows: 14.  [Each] Following a courts determination that a dog is potentially dangerous or vicious, the municipality in which the dog owner resides shall: a.     in the case of a potentially dangerous dog, issue the dog owner a potentially dangerous dog registration number and red identification tag [along], together with a municipal potentially dangerous dog license, upon [a demonstration of] the owners provision, to the animal control officer, of sufficient evidence [by the owner to the animal control officer] demonstrating that [he] the owner has complied with the court's orders with respect to the ongoing care and control of the potentially dangerous dog.  The last three digits of each potentially dangerous dog registration number [issued by a municipality will] shall be the three number code assigned to that municipality in the regulations promulgated pursuant to section 17 of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-33)[.  The animal control officer shall verify, in writing, compliance to the municipal clerk or other official designated to license dogs in the municipality]; and b.    [publicize a telephone number for reporting violations of this act.  This telephone number shall be forwarded to the department and any changes in this number shall be reported immediately to the department.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill) c.     in the case of a vicious dog not ordered to be euthanized, issue the dog owner a vicious dog registration number and red identification tag, together with a municipal vicious dog license, upon the owners provision, to the animal control officer, of sufficient evidence demonstrating that the owner has complied with the court's orders with respect to the care and control of the vicious dog.  The last digits of each vicious dog registration number issued by a municipality shall be the code assigned to that municipality in the regulations promulgated pursuant to section 17 of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-33).

(cf:  P.L.1994, c.187, s.11) 19.  Section 15 of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-31) is amended to read as follows: 15.  Every municipality may, by ordinance, fix the sum to be paid annually for a potentially dangerous dog license or a vicious dog license and for each renewal thereof, which sum shall not be less than $150 nor more than $700.  In the absence of any local ordinance, the fee for all potentially dangerous dog licenses and vicious dog licenses shall be $150. (cf:  P.L.1989, c.307, s.15) 20.  Section 16 of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-32) is amended to read as follows: 16.  [The] Following a courts determination that a dog is potentially dangerous or is vicious but not subject to euthanization, the municipal animal control officer shall inspect the dogs enclosure and the owner's property, on at least a monthly basis, to [determine] ensure that the owner is continuing [compliance] to comply with [paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection a. of] the requirements imposed by the court pursuant to section 8 of [this act] P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-24). (cf:  P.L.1989, c.307, s.16) 21.  Section 17 of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-33) is amended to read as follows: 17.  The department shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), establishing a uniform Statewide system for the municipal registration of potentially dangerous dogs and vicious dogs that are not subject to euthanasia.  The regulations shall assign each municipality or other registering authority [registering potentially dangerous dogs] a three number code.  This three number code shall comprise the last three digits of each registration number that is issued by [that] the municipality or other registering authority for a potentially dangerous [dogs] dog or for a vicious dog that is not subject to euthanasia, and shall be preceded on each dog's identification by a number sequentially issued by the municipality. (cf:  P.L.1989, c.307, s.17) 22. Sections 6 and 7 of this act shall take effect immediately, and sections 1 through 5 and sections 8 through 21 of this act shall take effect on the first day of the first year next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill, to be known as the Better Care Dog Act, would provide for the Department of Health, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, to establish a uniform Statewide system, which provides leashing and fencing requirements designed to restrain the movement of free-roaming dogs, and it would require all municipalities in the State to adopt ordinances consistent with this Statewide system.  The bill would also clarify that certain special requirements that are applicable, under existing State law, to the owners of potentially dangerous dogs are also applicable to the owners of vicious dogs that have not been ordered to be euthanized.  Finally, the bill would establish new criminal offenses and penalties for dog owners whose unrestrained dog attacks, injures, or kills another person, as well as civil penalties for dog owners who fail to restrain their dogs when those dogs are off the owners property. Specifically, the bill would provide that, whenever a dog is off the property of its owner, the dog will be required to be on a leash or otherwise controlled with another appropriate restraint unless the owner is exempt from this requirement, as provided by the bill or by any other rule, regulation, ordinance, or resolution adopted by the State or a municipality pursuant thereto.  The bill would expressly exempt, from its leashing requirements, any working or hunting dog while the dog is engaged in agricultural work or hunting activities.  If a dog owner is found, by clear and convincing evidence, to have allowed a dog to be unrestrained while off the owners property, or to have violated any similar provision of a municipal ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation concerning dog leashing or restraints, the owner would be subject to a fine of $100 for the first violation, $250 for the second violation, and $500 for the third and any subsequent violation, regardless of whether the unrestrained dog attacked or caused bodily injury to a person. Whenever an unrestrained dog, while off the property of the owner, attacks a person without causing bodily injury, the municipality would additionally be required to issue a warning notice to the dog owner indicating that, in addition to any applicable fines imposed for failing to restrain the dog, the owner may also be required to comply with fencing requirements to control the dog, in the discretion of the enforcing authority, in the event that the dog is again found unrestrained and off the property of the owner after the issuance of the warning notice. The bill would further provide that, upon the third time a dog is found unrestrained and off the owners property, or, in the discretion of the municipality, the first time that the dog is found unrestrained and off the owners property following the issuance of a warning notice for the dog, as described above, and provided that the unrestrained dog has not attacked or caused bodily injury to another person, the municipality will be required to order the owner to comply with the fencing requirements established pursuant to the bill, including any specifications for the installation of such fencing, in accordance with a compliance schedule established by the municipality. If a dog owner is found, by clear and convincing evidence, to have violated a municipal fencing order or compliance schedule, the owner would be subject to a fine of $200 per day of the violation, with each days continuance of the violation constituting a separate and distinct offense.  The municipality would additionally be required to revoke any registration previously issued for the dog. The bills warning and fencing requirements would not apply in any case where: (1)  the dog, while unrestrained and off the owners property, kills a person, causes serious bodily injury to a person, or both causes bodily injury to a person during an unprovoked attack and poses a serious threat of harm to other persons or domestic animals, in which case, the dog and the dogs owner would be subject to the applicable provisions of the States criminal code and vicious and potentially dangerous dogs act; (2)  the dog owner is a resident of a condominium, townhouse, apartment, or other rental property where the installation of fencing is impractical, or the owner is otherwise exempt from fencing requirements established pursuant to the bill, in which case, the municipality is to require the owner to pay a fine for the failure to restrain the dog, in the amount described above, and may additionally require the owner to comply with alternative enclosure requirements, to the extent that such alternative enclosures are authorized by ordinance, rule, regulation, or resolution of the municipality; or (3)  a person, other than the owner, intentionally removed the dog from the owners property, such as by walking the dog beyond the boundaries of the owners property, taking the dog to a park or other public open space, or taking the dog to the property of another person who is not the owner, and the dog, while unrestrained and off the owners property, attacked a person without causing bodily injury, in which case, the municipality is to require the owner to pay a fine for failure to restrain the dog, in the amount described above, but may not require the owner to comply with fencing or alternative enclosure requirements. The municipal court would have jurisdiction to enforce the bills provisions, in this regard, and to impose the fines described above.  Any fines collected pursuant to the bill are to be paid to the municipality in which the violation occurred. The bill requires the Department of Health, in consultation with the New Jersey Certified Animal Control Officers Association, the League of Municipalities, and the New Jersey Veterinary Medical Association, to adopt rules and regulations, within 180 days after the bills effective date, to implement the bills provisions related to the leashing and fencing of dogs.  Those rules and regulations are to: (1)  establish standards and requirements, consistent with the bills provisions, governing the leashing or other restraint of a dog when it is off the property of its owner; (2)  identify the circumstances or areas of the State in which a dog owner will be exempt from the bills leashing requirements, including, but not limited to, exemptions authorizing a dog to be unrestrained while exercising in a dog park; (3)  establish standards and requirements for fencing, which would apply when the fencing of a dog is required pursuant to the bill.  These standards and requirements would, at a minimum:  address the appropriate height and other dimensions of the fencing; establish exemptions from fencing requirements; and identify acceptable alternative enclosure options, if any, that may be used by residents of condominiums, townhouses, apartments, and other rental properties where the installation of fencing is impractical and by other dog owners who are exempt from fencing requirements established under the bill; and (4)  establish any other requirements for the control and regulation of the free movement of dogs, as deemed by the department to be appropriate, reasonable, and necessary for the public health and safety. In order to facilitate the enactment, across the State, of uniform municipal ordinances addressing the leashing and fencing of free-roaming dogs, the department would be required to adopt model ordinances, incorporating the leashing and fencing standards and requirements adopted by the department, which ordinances may then be adopted by municipalities pursuant to the bill. The bill would require each municipality, within 180 days after the department publishes its rules and regulations, to:  adopt an ordinance, resolution, or regulation that, at a minimum, incorporates the standards and requirements established by the department and provides for the municipal enforcement of the leashing and fencing provisions of the bill; and establish a dedicated fund to finance the municipal enforcement of the bill, which fund is to be separate from the other funds of the municipality.  The municipality would be authorized to allocate to, and deposit in, the fund, moneys obtained from dog licenses and other related fees, as well as monetary penalties collected pursuant to the bill.  Moneys in the dedicated fund may be used for the following purposes only: (1)  to facilitate the enforcement of any standard, requirement, law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation adopted by the State or municipality in relation to vicious dogs, potentially dangerous dogs, or other dogs registered in the municipality; (2)  to publicize the provisions of the bill and the rules, regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted thereunder; (3)  to publicize the telephone number, established pursuant to the bills provisions, that can be used by members of the public to report violations of the States vicious and potentially dangerous dogs act and the Better Care Dog Act; (4)  to post signage related to vicious dogs, potentially dangerous dogs, or other dogs registered in the municipality; (5)  to provide free or discounted leashes, collars, and other dog restraints to dog owners who would otherwise be unable to afford such restraints; and (6)  to cover any other municipal expense incurred pursuant to this bill. In addition to providing for the establishment of a uniform, Statewide dog leashing and fencing system, the bill would establish the following new criminal offenses for dog owners whose unrestrained dog attacks or injures another person while off the property of the owner: (1)  Simple assault, as a crime of the fourth degree, when a person purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space, or purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly fails to comply with requirements imposed by a court, pursuant to P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-17 et seq.), in association with the persons ownership of a potentially dangerous dog or vicious dog, and the dog, as a result of the owners actions, attacks and causes bodily injury to another person; (2)  Aggravated assault, as a crime of the third degree, when a person purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space, or purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly fails to comply with requirements imposed by a court, pursuant to P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-17 et seq.), in association with the persons ownership of a potentially dangerous dog or vicious dog, and the dog, as a result of the owners actions, attacks and causes serious bodily injury to another person; (3)  Criminal homicide via death by dog, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space, and the unrestrained dog kills another person in an unprovoked attack; (4)  Endangering the welfare of a child, as a crime of the second degree, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while unrestrained, kills a child; (5)  Endangering the welfare of a child, as a crime of the third degree, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while unrestrained, causes serious bodily injury to a child; (6)  Endangering the welfare of a child, as a crime of the fourth degree, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while unrestrained, causes bodily injury to a child; and (7)  Endangering the welfare of a child, as a disorderly persons offense, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while unrestrained, attacks a child without causing bodily injury. The bill would further provide that, in any prosecution undertaken pursuant to the bills provisions, it will be an affirmative defense that the dog:  (1) was provoked into attacking the victim; (2) was defending or protecting itself or its offspring from injury or attack; or (3) was defending or protecting its owner from injury or attack, provided that the owner was not, at the time, engaged in a criminal offense. The bill would also amend the State law pertaining to potentially dangerous and vicious dogs, in order to clarify that the laws special registration and licensure requirements and enhanced dog care restrictions are equally applicable both to potentially dangerous dogs and to vicious dogs that have not been ordered euthanized. Finally, the bill would provide that, whenever a person registers or licenses a dog with a municipality, the municipal clerk or other official issuing the license will be required to provide the person with notice of:  the new criminal offenses established by the bill; the provisions of the States vicious and potentially dangerous dogs act; the provisions of sections 4 of this bill, pertaining to dog leashing and fencing; and any other provisions, adopted by ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of the State or municipality, that govern the leashing, restraint, or movement of dogs. The provisions of the bill requiring the Department of Health to adopt rules and regulations to implement the new, uniform dog leashing and fencing system, and the provisions of the bill requiring each municipality in the State to adopt ordinances, regulations, or resolutions consistent with that uniform Statewide system, would each become effective immediately upon the bills enactment.  In order to provide the department and each municipality with enough time to complete the regulatory action needed to effectively implement the bill, the remaining provisions of the bill would remain inoperable until the first day of the first year next following the date of enactment.

A3320 ASSEMBLY, No. 3320 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  YVONNE LOPEZ District 19 (Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Better Care Dog Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the improved care of dogs, supplementing Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes and Title 4 of the Revised Statutes, and amending various sections of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  Sections 1 through 8 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known, and may be cited, as the Better Care Dog Act. 2.   (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares the following: a.   There is a need to address and prevent the negative behaviors of, and facilitate safe human interactions with, dogs in the State. b.   Currently, the behavior and care of dogs is inconsistently and haphazardly regulated, across the State, through a complex system of local ordinances that vary from municipality to municipality.  Some municipalities, moreover, have not adopted any local ordinances to address the behavior or responsible care of vicious dogs, potentially dangerous dogs, or other dogs residing in the municipality, thereby resulting in a lack of guidance on these issues. c.   While State law does address how a dog is to be treated and penalized when the dog engages in potentially dangerous or vicious behaviors, the law is silent on the issue of whether and how a dog owner is to be held responsible for the potentially dangerous or vicious behavior of a dog owned thereby.  Similarly, while State law addresses what is to happen when a dog causes bodily injury to a person, it does not address what is to occur when a dog has not caused bodily injury, but roams free without a leash or other controls that are designed to prevent the dog from causing bodily injury.  Specifically, the law provides no guidance regarding whether and how dog owners are to act proactively to control free-roaming dogs before those dogs cause bodily injury to another person. d.   Children are at particular risk when confronted by an unrestrained dog, due to their small stature in comparison to most dogs, and also due to their innocence, inexperience, and emotional perceptions. e.   The euthanasia of dogs that have evidenced vicious behaviors, as authorized by existing law, is appropriate in order to prevent the ongoing transfer of aggressive dogs from owner to owner, and the application of additional restrictions on the continued ownership of vicious dogs that are not ordered to be euthanized is necessary to protect the public from ongoing aggression from such dogs. f.    Dog owners generally embrace their role as caretakers and trainers of their dogs and are likely to be the first to wish to curtail any negative interactions between themselves, their dogs, children, and any other members of the communities in which they live. g.   Any regulation of dog behavior must be implemented with consideration, forethought, and reasonableness for the good of both the public and dog owners in the State. h.   By imposing leashing requirements for all dogs and fencing requirements for dogs that are repeatedly found off leash and outside the owners control; by subjecting a dog owner to criminal liability, and establishing specific guidelines for the prosecution of dog owners, when an unrestrained dog attacks or injures another person; and by subjecting a dog owner to civil penalties when the owners failure to engage in safe dog care causes a threat to public safety, the State can enhance the uniformity of regulations and promote consistency in prosecutorial decision making, across various jurisdictions, with respect to dog-related injuries and offenses, and better facilitate the well-being of children, other citizens, and dogs in the State in a manner that is consistent with accepted notions of responsible dog ownership to which so many, if not all, dog owners are committed and subscribe. i.    The Department of Health, acting in consultation and collaboration with all relevant stakeholders, is well positioned to develop and implement a Statewide regulatory system for safe dog care that will effectively enhance public health and safety while protecting the wellbeing of dogs in the State. j.    Based on the foregoing findings, the Legislature determines that it is reasonable and appropriate, and in the public interest, for the State to facilitate the public health and safety, as well as the improved care of dogs in the State, by: (1)  requiring the Department of Health to establish a uniform Statewide system, which provides leashing and fencing requirements designed to restrain the movement of free-roaming dogs; (2)  requiring all municipalities in the State to adopt ordinances consistent with the Statewide system established by the Department of Health; (3)  clarifying that the States special dog registration and licensure requirements apply both to potentially dangerous dogs and to vicious dogs that are not ordered to be euthanized; and (4)  establishing criminal and civil penalties for dog owners whose unrestrained dog attacks or injures another person, or who otherwise fails to engage in safe dog care, as required by P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and the rules, regulations, ordinances, and resolutions adopted pursuant thereto. 3.   (New section)  As used in sections 1 through 8 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Alternative enclosure means a type of enclosure, other than one created through the use of fencing, which can be used, by a dog owner who is otherwise exempt from the fencing requirements of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), to restrict the movement of an otherwise unrestrained dog while the dog is on the owners property but outside the walls of the owners home. Bodily injury means the same as that term is defined in N.J.S.2C:11-1. Department means the Department of Health. Owner means a person who owns the dog at issue. Serious bodily injury means the same as that term is defined in N.J.S.2C:11-1. Unrestrained means that a dog is off leash and not controlled by another appropriate restraint. 4. (New section)  a.  (1) Whenever a dog is off the property of the owner, the dog shall be on a leash or controlled with another appropriate restraint unless the owner is subject to an exemption from this requirement, as provided by paragraph (2) of this subsection or by any other rule, regulation, ordinance, or resolution adopted by the State or a municipality pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).

It shall be no defense to a prosecution for a violation of subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that the defendant was unaware that the prohibited conduct took place while on or within 1,000 feet of any school property or while driving through a school crossing.  Nor shall it be a defense to a prosecution under subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that no juveniles were present on the school property or crossing zone at the time of the offense or that the school was not in session. (4)  Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the third degree if the person purposely drives a vehicle in an aggressive manner directed at another vehicle and serious bodily injury results, and is a crime of the fourth degree if the person purposely drives a vehicle in an aggressive manner directed at another vehicle and bodily injury results.  [For purposes of] As used in this paragraph, "driving a vehicle in an aggressive manner" shall include, but is not limited to, unexpectedly altering the speed of the vehicle, making improper or erratic traffic lane changes, disregarding traffic control devices, failing to yield the right of way, or following another vehicle too closely.

Sections 6 and 7 of this act shall take effect immediately, and sections 1 through 5 and sections 8 through 21 of this act shall take effect on the first day of the first year next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill, to be known as the Better Care Dog Act, would provide for the Department of Health, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, to establish a uniform Statewide system, which provides leashing and fencing requirements designed to restrain the movement of free-roaming dogs, and it would require all municipalities in the State to adopt ordinances consistent with this Statewide system.  The bill would also clarify that certain special requirements that are applicable, under existing State law, to the owners of potentially dangerous dogs are also applicable to the owners of vicious dogs that have not been ordered to be euthanized.  Finally, the bill would establish new criminal offenses and penalties for dog owners whose unrestrained dog attacks, injures, or kills another person, as well as civil penalties for dog owners who fail to restrain their dogs when those dogs are off the owners property. Specifically, the bill would provide that, whenever a dog is off the property of its owner, the dog will be required to be on a leash or otherwise controlled with another appropriate restraint unless the owner is exempt from this requirement, as provided by the bill or by any other rule, regulation, ordinance, or resolution adopted by the State or a municipality pursuant thereto.  The bill would expressly exempt, from its leashing requirements, any working or hunting dog while the dog is engaged in agricultural work or hunting activities.  If a dog owner is found, by clear and convincing evidence, to have allowed a dog to be unrestrained while off the owners property, or to have violated any similar provision of a municipal ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation concerning dog leashing or restraints, the owner would be subject to a fine of $100 for the first violation, $250 for the second violation, and $500 for the third and any subsequent violation, regardless of whether the unrestrained dog attacked or caused bodily injury to a person. Whenever an unrestrained dog, while off the property of the owner, attacks a person without causing bodily injury, the municipality would additionally be required to issue a warning notice to the dog owner indicating that, in addition to any applicable fines imposed for failing to restrain the dog, the owner may also be required to comply with fencing requirements to control the dog, in the discretion of the enforcing authority, in the event that the dog is again found unrestrained and off the property of the owner after the issuance of the warning notice. The bill would further provide that, upon the third time a dog is found unrestrained and off the owners property, or, in the discretion of the municipality, the first time that the dog is found unrestrained and off the owners property following the issuance of a warning notice for the dog, as described above, and provided that the unrestrained dog has not attacked or caused bodily injury to another person, the municipality will be required to order the owner to comply with the fencing requirements established pursuant to the bill, including any specifications for the installation of such fencing, in accordance with a compliance schedule established by the municipality. If a dog owner is found, by clear and convincing evidence, to have violated a municipal fencing order or compliance schedule, the owner would be subject to a fine of $200 per day of the violation, with each days continuance of the violation constituting a separate and distinct offense.  The municipality would additionally be required to revoke any registration previously issued for the dog. The bills warning and fencing requirements would not apply in any case where: (1)  the dog, while unrestrained and off the owners property, kills a person, causes serious bodily injury to a person, or both causes bodily injury to a person during an unprovoked attack and poses a serious threat of harm to other persons or domestic animals, in which case, the dog and the dogs owner would be subject to the applicable provisions of the States criminal code and vicious and potentially dangerous dogs act; (2)  the dog owner is a resident of a condominium, townhouse, apartment, or other rental property where the installation of fencing is impractical, or the owner is otherwise exempt from fencing requirements established pursuant to the bill, in which case, the municipality is to require the owner to pay a fine for the failure to restrain the dog, in the amount described above, and may additionally require the owner to comply with alternative enclosure requirements, to the extent that such alternative enclosures are authorized by ordinance, rule, regulation, or resolution of the municipality; or (3)  a person, other than the owner, intentionally removed the dog from the owners property, such as by walking the dog beyond the boundaries of the owners property, taking the dog to a park or other public open space, or taking the dog to the property of another person who is not the owner, and the dog, while unrestrained and off the owners property, attacked a person without causing bodily injury, in which case, the municipality is to require the owner to pay a fine for failure to restrain the dog, in the amount described above, but may not require the owner to comply with fencing or alternative enclosure requirements. The municipal court would have jurisdiction to enforce the bills provisions, in this regard, and to impose the fines described above.  Any fines collected pursuant to the bill are to be paid to the municipality in which the violation occurred. The bill requires the Department of Health, in consultation with the New Jersey Certified Animal Control Officers Association, the League of Municipalities, and the New Jersey Veterinary Medical Association, to adopt rules and regulations, within 180 days after the bills effective date, to implement the bills provisions related to the leashing and fencing of dogs.  Those rules and regulations are to: (1)  establish standards and requirements, consistent with the bills provisions, governing the leashing or other restraint of a dog when it is off the property of its owner; (2)  identify the circumstances or areas of the State in which a dog owner will be exempt from the bills leashing requirements, including, but not limited to, exemptions authorizing a dog to be unrestrained while exercising in a dog park; (3)  establish standards and requirements for fencing, which would apply when the fencing of a dog is required pursuant to the bill.  These standards and requirements would, at a minimum:  address the appropriate height and other dimensions of the fencing; establish exemptions from fencing requirements; and identify acceptable alternative enclosure options, if any, that may be used by residents of condominiums, townhouses, apartments, and other rental properties where the installation of fencing is impractical and by other dog owners who are exempt from fencing requirements established under the bill; and (4)  establish any other requirements for the control and regulation of the free movement of dogs, as deemed by the department to be appropriate, reasonable, and necessary for the public health and safety. In order to facilitate the enactment, across the State, of uniform municipal ordinances addressing the leashing and fencing of free-roaming dogs, the department would be required to adopt model ordinances, incorporating the leashing and fencing standards and requirements adopted by the department, which ordinances may then be adopted by municipalities pursuant to the bill. The bill would require each municipality, within 180 days after the department publishes its rules and regulations, to:  adopt an ordinance, resolution, or regulation that, at a minimum, incorporates the standards and requirements established by the department and provides for the municipal enforcement of the leashing and fencing provisions of the bill; and establish a dedicated fund to finance the municipal enforcement of the bill, which fund is to be separate from the other funds of the municipality.  The municipality would be authorized to allocate to, and deposit in, the fund, moneys obtained from dog licenses and other related fees, as well as monetary penalties collected pursuant to the bill.  Moneys in the dedicated fund may be used for the following purposes only: (1)  to facilitate the enforcement of any standard, requirement, law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation adopted by the State or municipality in relation to vicious dogs, potentially dangerous dogs, or other dogs registered in the municipality; (2)  to publicize the provisions of the bill and the rules, regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted thereunder; (3)  to publicize the telephone number, established pursuant to the bills provisions, that can be used by members of the public to report violations of the States vicious and potentially dangerous dogs act and the Better Care Dog Act; (4)  to post signage related to vicious dogs, potentially dangerous dogs, or other dogs registered in the municipality; (5)  to provide free or discounted leashes, collars, and other dog restraints to dog owners who would otherwise be unable to afford such restraints; and (6)  to cover any other municipal expense incurred pursuant to this bill. In addition to providing for the establishment of a uniform, Statewide dog leashing and fencing system, the bill would establish the following new criminal offenses for dog owners whose unrestrained dog attacks or injures another person while off the property of the owner: (1)  Simple assault, as a crime of the fourth degree, when a person purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space, or purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly fails to comply with requirements imposed by a court, pursuant to P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-17 et seq.), in association with the persons ownership of a potentially dangerous dog or vicious dog, and the dog, as a result of the owners actions, attacks and causes bodily injury to another person; (2)  Aggravated assault, as a crime of the third degree, when a person purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space, or purposefully, knowingly, or recklessly fails to comply with requirements imposed by a court, pursuant to P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-17 et seq.), in association with the persons ownership of a potentially dangerous dog or vicious dog, and the dog, as a result of the owners actions, attacks and causes serious bodily injury to another person; (3)  Criminal homicide via death by dog, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space, and the unrestrained dog kills another person in an unprovoked attack; (4)  Endangering the welfare of a child, as a crime of the second degree, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while unrestrained, kills a child; (5)  Endangering the welfare of a child, as a crime of the third degree, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while unrestrained, causes serious bodily injury to a child; (6)  Endangering the welfare of a child, as a crime of the fourth degree, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while unrestrained, causes bodily injury to a child; and (7)  Endangering the welfare of a child, as a disorderly persons offense, when a person purposely, knowingly, or recklessly allows a dog owned thereby to be unrestrained while in a residential neighborhood, park, or other publicly accessible open space in which a child may be present, and the dog, while unrestrained, attacks a child without causing bodily injury. The bill would further provide that, in any prosecution undertaken pursuant to the bills provisions, it will be an affirmative defense that the dog:  (1) was provoked into attacking the victim; (2) was defending or protecting itself or its offspring from injury or attack; or (3) was defending or protecting its owner from injury or attack, provided that the owner was not, at the time, engaged in a criminal offense. The bill would also amend the State law pertaining to potentially dangerous and vicious dogs, in order to clarify that the laws special registration and licensure requirements and enhanced dog care restrictions are equally applicable both to potentially dangerous dogs and to vicious dogs that have not been ordered euthanized. Finally, the bill would provide that, whenever a person registers or licenses a dog with a municipality, the municipal clerk or other official issuing the license will be required to provide the person with notice of:  the new criminal offenses established by the bill; the provisions of the States vicious and potentially dangerous dogs act; the provisions of sections 4 of this bill, pertaining to dog leashing and fencing; and any other provisions, adopted by ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of the State or municipality, that govern the leashing, restraint, or movement of dogs. The provisions of the bill requiring the Department of Health to adopt rules and regulations to implement the new, uniform dog leashing and fencing system, and the provisions of the bill requiring each municipality in the State to adopt ordinances, regulations, or resolutions consistent with that uniform Statewide system, would each become effective immediately upon the bills enactment.  In order to provide the department and each municipality with enough time to complete the regulatory action needed to effectively implement the bill, the remaining provisions of the bill would remain inoperable until the first day of the first year next following the date of enactment.
