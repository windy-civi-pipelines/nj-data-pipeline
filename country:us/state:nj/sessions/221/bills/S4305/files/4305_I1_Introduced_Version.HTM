<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2017, c.262, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    Section 10 of P.L.1968,
c.410 (C.52:14B-10) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  In a contested case:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) (1) The parties shall not
be bound by rules of evidence whether statutory, common law, or adopted
formally by the Rules of Court.  All relevant evidence is admissible, except as
otherwise provided herein.  The administrative law judge may, in his discretion
, exclude any evidence if he finds that its probative value is substantially
outweighed by the risk that its admission will either necessitate undue
consumption of time or create substantial danger of undue prejudice or
confusion.  The administrative law judge shall give effect to the rules of
privilege recognized by law.  Any party in a contested case may present his
case or defense by oral and documentary evidence, submit rebuttal evidence and
conduct such cross-examination as may be required, in the discretion of the
administrative law judge, for a full and true disclosure of the facts.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Where the case involves
a permitting or licensing decision of the Department of Environmental
Protection, the department shall be required to produce and certify a
permitting record within 30 days after the filing of the contested case.  This
deadline may be extended by an administrative law judge upon the unanimous
agreement of the parties.  The production and certification of the department's
permitting record, in accordance with this paragraph, shall not limit the
ability of the parties to further supplement the record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Notice may be taken of
judicially noticeable facts.  In addition, notice may be taken of generally
recognized technical or scientific facts within the specialized knowledge of
the agency or administrative law judge.  Parties shall be notified either
before or during the hearing, or by reference in preliminary reports or
otherwise, of the material noticed, including any staff memoranda or data, and
they shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the material so noticed.  The
experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency or
administrative law judge may be utilized in the evaluation of the evidence,
provided this is disclosed of record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   <u>(1)</u> All hearings
of a State agency required to be conducted as a contested case under this act
or any other law shall be conducted by an administrative law judge assigned by
the Director and Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative
Law, except as provided by this amendatory and supplementary act.  A
recommended report and decision which contains recommended findings of fact and
conclusions of law and which shall be based upon sufficient, competent, and
credible evidence shall be filed, not later than 45 days after the hearing is
concluded, with the agency in such form that it may be adopted as the decision
in the case and delivered or mailed, to the parties of record with an
indication of the date of receipt by the agency head; and an opportunity shall
be afforded each party of record to file exceptions, objections, and replies
thereto, and to present argument to the head of the agency or a majority
thereof, either orally or in writing, as the agency may direct.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(2)</u> Unless the head of
the agency or a party requests that the recommended report and decision be
filed in writing, the recommended report and decision of the administrative law
judge may be filed orally in such appropriate cases as prescribed by the
director and if a transcript has been requested pursuant to subsection (e) of
section 9 of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-9).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(3)</u> An administrative
law judge may file a recommended report and decision in the form of a checklist
in such appropriate cases and formats as prescribed by the director after
consultation with each State agency.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(4)</u> The head of the
agency, upon a review of the record submitted by the administrative law judge,
shall adopt, reject or modify the recommended report and decision no later than
45 days after receipt of such recommendations.  In reviewing the decision of an
administrative law judge, the agency head may reject or modify findings of
fact, conclusions of law or interpretations of agency policy in the decision,
but shall state clearly the reasons for doing so.  The agency head may not
reject or modify any findings of fact as to issues of credibility of lay
witness testimony unless it is first determined from a review of the record
that the findings are arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable or are not
supported by sufficient, competent, and credible evidence in the record.  In
rejecting or modifying any findings of fact, the agency head shall state with
particularity the reasons for rejecting the findings and shall make new or
modified findings supported by sufficient, competent, and credible evidence in
the record.  Unless the head of the agency modifies or rejects the report
within such period, the decision of the administrative law judge shall be
deemed adopted as the final decision of the head of the agency.  The
recommended report and decision shall be a part of the record in the case.  For
good cause shown, upon certification by the director and the agency head, the
time limits established herein may be subject to a single extension of not more
than 45 days.  Any additional extension of time shall be subject to, and
contingent upon, the unanimous agreement of the parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(5) Whenever the head of
the agency rejects or modifies the recommended report and decision of an
administrative law judge pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection, and the
modification or rejection is subsequently overturned by judicial review, the agency
shall be liable for the plaintiff's attorneys' fees incurred in the court
challenge to the final agency decision.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   A final decision or
order adverse to a party in a contested case shall be in writing or stated in
the record.  A final decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of
law, separately stated and shall be based only upon the evidence of record at the
hearing, as such evidence may be established by rules of evidence and procedure
promulgated by the director. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Findings of fact, if set forth
in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement
of the underlying facts supporting the findings.  The final decision may
incorporate by reference any or all of the recommendations of the
administrative law judge.  Parties shall be notified either personally or by
mail of any decision or order. Upon request a copy of the decision or order
shall be delivered or mailed forthwith by registered or certified mail to each
party and to his attorney of record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   Except where otherwise
provided by law, the administrative adjudication of the agency shall be
effective on the date of delivery or on the date of mailing, of the final
decision to the parties of record whichever shall occur first, or shall be
effective on any date after the date of delivery or mailing, as the agency may
provide by general rule or by order in the case.  The date of delivery or
mailing shall be stamped on the face of the decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   The head of an agency
may order that, in certain appropriate cases, the recommended report and
decision of the administrative law judge shall be deemed adopted, immediately
on filing thereof with the agency, as the final decision of the head of the
agency.  The appropriate cases shall be described in a written order issued by
the head of the agency, filed with the director, and made available to the
public as a government record.  The order shall not include any contested case
for which the head of the agency is specifically required by State or federal
law to review the recommended report and decision and adopt the final
decision.  The head of the agency may revise or revoke an order, issued
pursuant to this subsection, whenever it is deemed appropriate.  The order
shall apply to all appropriate contested cases commenced with the agency after
the order's issuance and until the order is rescinded or modified.  In such
appropriate contested cases, the head of the agency shall not have the
opportunity to reject or modify the administrative law judge's recommended
report and decision pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and the final
decision by the administrative law judge shall comply with the requirements of
and shall be given the same effect as a final decision of the head of the
agency pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   Whenever the parties in
a contested case stipulate to the factual record, and agree that there are no
genuine issues of material fact to be adjudicated, the head of the agency may,
in his discretion, render a final agency decision on the matter without
obtaining the prior input of, or a recommended report and decision from, an
administrative law judge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2013, c.236, s.2)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.  This act shall take effect
one year after the date of enactment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would make various
changes to the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410
(C.52:14B-1 et seq.) and other laws that supplement that act, in order to alter
the procedures State agencies are required to follow when they adopt rules and
regulations to implement State and federal laws.  The bill would also provide
for the payment of attorney's fees in certain circumstances when the head of an
agency rejects or modifies the recommended report and decision of an
administrative law judge and the decision is overturned by a court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
require State agencies to make available for public viewing on the agency's
website (1) all public comments received related to each rule proposal issued
by the agency, and (2) all data sets and other information that were used by
the agency to formulate the proposed rule.  The bill would also require that
each rule proposal be directed toward a single object, prohibiting agencies
from bundling together unrelated rule proposals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would extend the
public comment period for rule proposals from 30 days to 60 days.  The bill
would require that the socio-economic impact statement for rule proposals
include estimates, in dollars, of the proposed rule's effect on annual
expenditures by the State, municipalities, businesses, and residents.  The bill
would also require rule proposals to include a consideration of alternatives to
the rule proposal, with a justification for why the proposed rule is superior
to the alternatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would provide that,
if 50 or more commenters request a 30-day extension to the public comment
period or a public hearing for a proposed rule, this would constitute &quot;sufficient
public interest&quot; for the purposes of section 4 of P.L.1968, c.410
(C.52:14B-4) and the agency proposing the rule would be required to grant the
extension or hold a public hearing, as applicable.  In addition, the bill would
require State agencies to hold a public hearing on a rule proposal if the
proposal is estimated to involve a substantive increase in  expenditures by the
State, municipalities, businesses, or residents.  The bill would direct each
State agency to formulate standards for what constitutes a &quot;substantive
increase in expenditures,&quot; but would establish a minimum threshold of $50
million in a calendar year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill would
require State agencies to file a notice of intent for each contemplated
rulemaking at least 90 days prior to issuing a formal rule proposal
notification.  Under current law, agencies are authorized, but not required, to
file a notice of intent.  The notice of intent is required to include a
statement of either the terms or substance of the intended action or a
description of the subjects and issues involved.  The agency would be required
to establish the time when, the place where, and the manner in which interested
persons may present their views on the contemplated rule-making.  The bill
would also require agencies to review and respond to petitions that claim that
one of the agency's rules is in conflict or inconsistent with another State or
federal rule.  Similarly, the bill would require State agencies to analyze
their rules to verify that they do not conflict with other State and federal
rules, prior to readopting them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the
Office of Administrative Law (OAL) to include all public comments received, and
all data and other information used, for each rulemaking action in its online
database of rulemaking actions.  The bill would also explicitly require State
agencies to provide all necessary information to the OAL for the development of
the online database.  In addition, the bill would require the OAL to update the
database daily, rather than making &quot;regular and timely updates,&quot; as
in current law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would
provide that, whenever the head of the agency rejects or modifies the
recommended report and decision of an administrative law judge pursuant to
subsection (c) of section 10 of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-10), and the
modification or rejection is subsequently overturned by judicial review, the
agency would be liable for the plaintiff's attorneys' fees incurred in the
court challenge to the final agency decision. </p>
