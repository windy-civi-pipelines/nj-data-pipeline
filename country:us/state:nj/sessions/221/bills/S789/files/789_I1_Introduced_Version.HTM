the ratio prescribed for admission in subsection a. of this section but is not
more than 25% above the family income so prescribed for admission to the

housing, in accordance with rules and regulations of the agency; and any such
family, with the approval of the agency, may be permitted to continue to occupy
the unit, subject to payment of a rent or carrying charge surcharge to the
housing sponsor in accordance with a schedule of surcharges fixed by the

granting tax exemption, but only up to an amount that together with payments
made to the municipality in lieu of taxes and for any land taxes equals 25% of
the total rents or carrying charges of the housing project for the current and
any prior years that the project has been in operation.</p>

finance fund securing the bonds issued to finance the project for the use of
the agency; for projects financed on or after January 1, 1973, any remainder of
