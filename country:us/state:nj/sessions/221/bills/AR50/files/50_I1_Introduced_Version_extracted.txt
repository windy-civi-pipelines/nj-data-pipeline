STATEMENT This resolution urges Congress to establish a student loan forgiveness program for doctors, nurses, and emergency medical services employees that provide services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Doctors, nurses, and EMS employees respond to, care for, and protect American citizens from illness and injury every day.  However, the already stressful job of doctors, nurses, and EMS employees is exacerbated during crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has increased the workloads of healthcare professionals and has forced doctors, nurses, and EMS employees to risk their lives while providing professional care services for others amidst this dangerous disease. Healthcare professionals continue to protect and care for their patients, during the COVID-19 pandemic, amongst limited resources and shortages of protective equipment. The bravery, courageousness, selflessness, and ceaseless work ethic of the nations healthcare professionals, during the COVID-19 pandemic, should be rewarded.  Although there is no reward that equates to the risks these healthcare professionals have taken, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States can provide monetary aid to these healthcare professionals, which will help minimize the massive student loan debts these healthcare professionals have accumulated over the years as a result of lengthy education.  Establishing a student loan forgiveness program for doctors, nurses, and EMS employees who provided services during the COVID-19 pandemic will reduce financial stressors among these hardworking healthcare professionals and show them that the United States acknowledges and appreciates their hard work during this challenging time.
