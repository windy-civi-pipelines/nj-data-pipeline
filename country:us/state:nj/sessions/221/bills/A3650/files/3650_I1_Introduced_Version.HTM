Section 1:
A3650 ASSEMBLY, No. 3650 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 12, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  CAROL A. MURPHY District 7 (Burlington) Assemblyman  WILLIAM B. SAMPSON, IV District 31 (Hudson) Assemblyman  GABRIEL RODRIGUEZ District 33 (Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblymen Marenco, Assemblywomen Collazos-Gill and Drulis SYNOPSIS Establishes minimum Medicaid reimbursement rate of $200 for basic life support emergency ambulance transportation services. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning ambulance services provided under Medicaid and supplementing Title 30 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The reimbursement rate for basic life support emergency ambulance transportation services within the Medicaid program, established pursuant to P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.), whether the services are provided in the Medicaid fee-for-service delivery system or through a managed care delivery system, shall be no less than $200 per transport. 2.    The Commissioner of Human Services shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 3.    The Commissioner of Human Services shall apply for such State plan amendments or waivers as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act and secure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes a minimum Medicaid reimbursement rate of $200 for basic life support emergency ambulance transportation services, an increase of $142 from the States existing rate of $58 per transport.  In doing so, the sponsor aims to ensure that emergency ambulance transportation providers, which deliver integral medical services for those with unplanned urgent and life-threatening health conditions, are given the financial support necessary to serve the community.  Currently, New Jersey has the lowest Medicaid reimbursement rate for basic life support emergency ambulance transportation services in the region. Surrounding states rates range from $65.27 in Delaware to $293.90 in Connecticut.  Moreover, pending legislation in Pennsylvania would increase that states rate to $325 per transport, which would be the highest rate in the region.
