described in the petition or complaint is thereby being taken by and for the
use of the corporation.  The said declaration of taking shall be sufficient if
it sets forth (1) a description of each tract or parcel of land or property to
be so taken sufficient for the identification thereof to which there shall be
attached a plan or map thereof;  (2) a statement of the estate or interest in
the said land or property being taken; (3) a statement of the sum of money
estimated by the corporation by  resolution to be just compensation for the

hereinafter provided.</p>

equal to twice the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior
Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of
taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined
and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court.  Said trust fund shall
consist of cash or securities readily convertible into cash constituting legal
investment for trust funds under the laws of this State.  Said trust fund shall
be held solely to secure and may be applied to the payment of just compensation
for the land or other property described in such declarations of taking.  The
corporation shall be entitled to withdraw from said trust fund from time to
time so much as may then be in excess of twice the aggregate of the amount deposited
with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property

declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said land or
property, it being the intent of this provision that the proceedings for
compensation or any other proceedings relating to the taking of said land or
interest therein or other property shall not delay the taking of possession
thereof and the use thereof by the corporation for the  purpose or purposes for
which the corporation is authorized by law to acquire or condemn such land or
other property or interest therein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The corporation shall cause
notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit to be

State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof  at his residence, if
known, and upon each party in interest residing out of the State, by mailing a
copy thereof to him at his residence, if known.  In the event that the
residence of any such party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice
shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the
county or counties in which the land is located.  Such service, mailing or
publication shall be made within 10 days after filing such  declaration.  Upon
the application of any party in interest and after notice to other parties in
interest, including the corporation, any judge of the Superior Court assigned
to sit for said county may order that the money deposited with the Clerk of the
Superior Court or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons
entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in
said proceeding; provided, that each such person shall have filed with the
Clerk of the Superior Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award
in the condemnation proceeding shall be less than the amount deposited, the
court, after notice as herein provided and hearing, may determine his
liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part  thereof and
enter judgment therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally determined
shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award
is payable shall be entitled to recover from the corporation the difference
between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at
the rate of 6% per annum thereon from the date of making the deposit.  If the
amount of the award shall be less than the amount so deposited, the Clerk of
the Superior Court shall return the difference between the amount of the award
and the deposit to the corporation unless the amount of the deposit or any part
thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in  which event the court, on
petition of the corporation and notice to all persons interested in the award
and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of
the corporation for such difference against the party or parties liable for the
return thereof.  The corporation shall cause notice of the date fixed for such
hearing to be served upon each party thereto residing in this State either
personally or by leaving a copy thereof at his residence, if known, and upon
each party residing out of the State by mailing a copy to him at his residence,
if known.  In the event that the residence of any party or the name of such
party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper
published or circulating in the county or counties in which the land is
located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made at least 10 days
before the date fixed for such hearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that each spring more than a million shorebirds of six species,
including the red knot, ruddy turnstone, sanderling, semipalmated sandpiper,
short-billed dowitcher, and dunlin, stop at <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>Delaware<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> Bay <u>of New
Jersey</u> beaches and feed upon horseshoe crab eggs; that the red knot was
once considered one of New Jersey's most abundant shorebirds; that this
critical food source of horseshoe crab eggs consumed during the stopover of the
red knot in New Jersey and Delaware is needed for the birds to gain sufficient
weight to continue their migration north to breeding grounds in the Canadian
Arctic, survive until food becomes available, and successfully reproduce ; that
surveys have shown that red knots migrating through the bay region have
declined by more than 75 percent since 2000; and that state and international
biologists fear that the red knot will become extinct as soon as 2010.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
and declares that the numbers of shorebirds other than the red knots that feed
on horseshoe crab eggs on the <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>Delaware<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> Bay <u>of New
Jersey</u> have declined by a highly significant 64 percent during the period
of 1998 through 2007.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
and declares that shorebird populations have continued to decline, despite the
fact that over the past two decades more than $3 million in public funds have
been spent on the protection and restoration of shorebird populations and their
habitats on <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>New

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature therefore

available as a food source, thus increasing the likelihood of survival of these
shorebirds.</p>

Statewide maritime development initiatives and technologies, planning for maritime
systems, enhancing New Jersey's marine environment, fostering maritime
education, and providing overall support functions to the maritime industry in
close coordination with the Department of Environmental Protection, the New
Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, and other State agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    New Jersey's maritime
industry is a $50 billion industry supporting more than 300,000 New Jersey
citizens.  The industry is located along 127 miles of New Jersey shoreline, on
116 State navigation channels, 240 miles of navigable waterways in New York
Harbor, and along 106 miles of the Delaware River and <u>the</u> Bay <u>of New
Jersey</u>. Throughout the State, warehousing, manufacturing and cargo handling
facilities service the commerce taking place along these water highways, and
the intermodal connections which service them support local, national and
international port commerce.  The industry includes boat-building companies,
members of the marine trades' associations, marinas, the commercial and
recreational fishing industry, science, technology, and educational and related
services.  It also includes those industries that support waterborne military
operations and national security initiatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The infrastructure
required to support New Jersey's commercial and recreational maritime industry
is collectively designated as New Jersey's Marine Transportation System.  It is
a comprehensive system which includes navigable channels, waterborne commerce,
dredging and dredged material management technologies, berth, terminal and
related structures, intermodal transportation facilities and corridors,
shipping, receiving and cargo-movement tracking systems, global positioning
systems, vessel traffic and port information systems, physical oceanographic
real-time systems, and geographical information systems.  Navigation aides,
boat building technologies, ocean habitat tracking systems and other new
technologies interact to create a seamless system linking all aspects of the
maritime industry into a single transportation matrix.  The Marine
Transportation System provides economic value, State and national security
support, environmental protection and recreational opportunity for the State,
the region and the nation.</p>

systems are a desirable, necessary and environmentally beneficial means of
moving people and goods and such systems will promote the development and
redevelopment of the State's urban centers.  It is further declared that in a
densely settled state such as New Jersey, it should be a priority of the
Department of Transportation to promote the development of water transportation
systems and to provide, as necessary for the public safety and welfare, for the
coordination and facilitation of water transportation systems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The State of New Jersey
hereby agrees with the State of Delaware, upon enactment by the State of
Delaware of legislation having the same effect as this section, to the
following compact:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     DELAWARE-NEW JERSEY COMPACT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whereas, The states of
Delaware and New Jersey are separated by the Delaware River and <u>the</u> Bay <u>of
New Jersey,</u> which create a natural obstacle to the uninterrupted passage of
traffic other than by water and with normal commercial activity between the two
states thereby hindering the economic growth and development of those areas in
both states which border the river and bay; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whereas, The pressures of
existing trends from increasing traffic, growing population and greater
industrialization indicate the need for closer cooperation between the two
states in order to advance the economic development and to improve crossings,
transportation, terminal and other facilities of the area; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whereas, The financing,
construction, operation and maintenance of such crossings, transportation,
terminal and other facilities of commerce and the overall planning for future
economic development of the area may be best accomplished for the benefit of
the two states and their citizens, the region and nation, by the cordial
cooperation of Delaware and New Jersey by and through a joint or common agency
or authority; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whereas, The Delaware-New
Jersey Compact, enacted pursuant to 53 Laws of Delaware, Chapter 145 (17 Del.
C. s.1701) and P.L.1961, c.66 (C.32:11E-1 et seq.) of the Pamphlet Laws of New
Jersey, with the consent of the United States Congress in accordance with
Pub.L.87-678 (1962), created the Delaware River and <u>the</u> Bay <u>of New
Jersey</u> Authority with the intention of advancing the economic growth and
development of those areas in both states which border the Delaware River and <u>the</u>
Bay <u>of New Jersey </u>by the financing, development, construction, operation
and maintenance of crossings, transportation or terminal facilities, and other
facilities of commerce, and by providing for overall planning for the future
economic development of those areas; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whereas, The economic growth
and development of areas of both states will be further advanced by authorizing
the authority to undertake economic development projects, other than major
projects as defined in Article II, at its own initiative, and to undertake
major projects after securing only such approvals as may be required by
legislation of the state in which the project is to be located, except that the
authority is prohibited from undertaking any major project, to be located in
the Delaware River or Bay, including, without limitation, any deep-water port
or superport, without the prior approval, by concurrent legislation, of the two
states; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whereas, The natural
environment of those areas in the two states which border the Delaware River
and <u>the</u> Bay <u>of New Jersey</u> would be better preserved by requiring
that the projects, other than crossings, of the authority shall be in complete
compliance with all applicable environmental protection laws and regulations
before the authority may undertake the planning, development, construction or
operation of any project, other than a crossing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     NOW, THEREFORE, The State of
Delaware and the State of New Jersey do hereby solemnly covenant and agree,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>EMINENT DOMAIN</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the authority shall find
and determine that any property or interest therein is required for a public
use in furtherance of the purposes of the authority, said determination shall
not be affected by the fact that such property has theretofore been taken over
or is then devoted to a public use, but the public use in the hands or under
the control of the authority, shall be deemed superior to the public use for
which it has theretofore been taken or to which it is then devoted.  The
authority shall not exercise the power of eminent domain granted herein to
acquire any property, other than a crossing, devoted to a public use, of either
state, or of any municipality, local government, agency, public authority or
commission, or of two or more of them, for any purpose other than a crossing,
without having first secured the authorization of the holder of the title to
the land in question and such other approvals as may be required by legislation
of the state in which the project is to be located.  The authority shall not
exercise the power of eminent domain in connection with any commerce facility
or development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In any condemnation proceeding
in connection with the acquisition by the authority of property or property
rights of any character in either state and the right of inspection and
immediate entry thereon, through the exercise by it of its power of eminent
domain, any existing or future law or rule of court of the state in which such
property is located with respect to the condemnation of property for the
construction, reconstruction and maintenance of highways therein, shall
control.  The authority shall have the same power and authority with respect
thereto as the state agency named in any such law; provided that nothing herein
contained shall be construed as requiring joint or concurrent action by the two
states with respect to the enactment, repeal or amendment of any law or rule of
court on the subject of condemnation under which the authority may proceed by
virtue of this article.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the established grade of
any street, avenue, highway or other route shall be changed by reason of the
construction by the authority of any work so as to cause loss or injury to any
property abutting on such street, avenue, highway or other route, the authority
may enter into voluntary agreements with such abutting property owners and pay
reasonable compensation for any loss or injury so sustained, whether or not it
be compensable as damages under the condemnation law of the state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The power of the authority to
acquire property by condemnation shall be a continuing power, and no exercise
thereof shall be deemed to exhaust it.</p>

may deem necessary, proper or desirable, in connection with any crossing,
transportation or terminal facility, commerce facility or development, or other
project which it is or may be authorized at any time to construct, own, operate
or control, and the aggregate of said tolls and charges shall be at least
sufficient (1) to meet the combined expenses of operation, maintenance and
improvement thereof, (2) to pay the cost of acquisition or construction, including
the payment, amortization and retirement of bonds or other securities or
obligations assumed, issued or incurred by the authority, together <br

authority is hereby authorized and empowered, subject to prior pledges, if any,
to pledge such tolls and other revenues or any part thereof as security for the
repayment with interest of any moneys borrowed by it or advanced to it for its
authorized purposes and as security for the satisfaction of any other
obligations assumed by it in connection with such loans or advances.  There
shall be allocated to the cost of the acquisition, construction, operation,
