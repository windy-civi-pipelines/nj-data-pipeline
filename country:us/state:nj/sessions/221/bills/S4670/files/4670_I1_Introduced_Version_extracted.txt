Upon the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the compensation to be paid thereunder shall be ascertained and paid in the manner provided in the "Eminent Domain Act of 1971," P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-1 et seq.), insofar as the provisions thereof are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions contained in this act. The  corporation may join in separate subdivisions in one petition or complaint the descriptions of any number of tracts or parcels of land or property to be condemned and the names of any number of owners and other parties who may have an interest therein and all such land or property included in said petition or complaint may be condemned in a single proceeding; provided, however, that separate awards be made for each tract or parcel of land or property; and provided further, that each of said tracts or parcels of land or property lies wholly in or has a substantial part of its value lying wholly within the same county. Upon the filing of such petition or complaint or at any time thereafter the corporation may file with the clerk of the county in which such property is located and also with the Clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by the corporation declaring that possession of one or more of the  tracts or parcels of land or property described in the petition or complaint is thereby being taken by and for the use of the corporation.  The said declaration of taking shall be sufficient if it sets forth (1) a description of each tract or parcel of land or property to be so taken sufficient for the identification thereof to which there shall be attached a plan or map thereof;  (2) a statement of the estate or interest in the said land or property being taken; (3) a statement of the sum of money estimated by the corporation by  resolution to be just compensation for the taking of the estate or interest in each tract or parcel of land or property described in said declaration; and (4) that, in compliance with the provisions of this act, the corporation has established and is maintaining a trust fund as hereinafter provided. Upon the filing of the said declaration, the corporation shall deposit with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration.  In addition to the said deposits with the Clerk of the Superior Court the corporation at all times shall maintain a special trust fund on deposit with a bank or trust company doing business in this State in an  account at least equal to twice the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court.  Said trust fund shall consist of cash or securities readily convertible into cash constituting legal investment for trust funds under the laws of this State.  Said trust fund shall be held solely to secure and may be applied to the payment of just compensation for the land or other property described in such declarations of taking.  The corporation shall be entitled to withdraw from said trust fund from time to time so much as may then be in excess of twice the aggregate of the amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined  and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court. Upon the filing of the said declaration as aforesaid and depositing with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration, the corporation without other process or proceedings, shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract of land or property described in said declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said land or property, it being the intent of this provision that the proceedings for compensation or any other proceedings relating to the taking of said land or interest therein or other property shall not delay the taking of possession thereof and the use thereof by the corporation for the  purpose or purposes for which the corporation is authorized by law to acquire or condemn such land or other property or interest therein. The corporation shall cause notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit to be served upon each party in interest named in the petition residing in this State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof  at his residence, if known, and upon each party in interest residing out of the State, by mailing a copy thereof to him at his residence, if known.  In the event that the residence of any such party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the land is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made within 10 days after filing such  declaration.  Upon the application of any party in interest and after notice to other parties in interest, including the corporation, any judge of the Superior Court assigned to sit for said county may order that the money deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in said proceeding; provided, that each such person shall have filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award in the condemnation proceeding shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after notice as herein provided and hearing, may determine his liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part  thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally determined shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award is payable shall be entitled to recover from the corporation the difference between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum thereon from the date of making the deposit.  If the amount of the award shall be less than the amount so deposited, the Clerk of the Superior Court shall return the difference between the amount of the award and the deposit to the corporation unless the amount of the deposit or any part thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in  which event the court, on petition of the corporation and notice to all persons interested in the award and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of the corporation for such difference against the party or parties liable for the return thereof.  The corporation shall cause notice of the date fixed for such hearing to be served upon each party thereto residing in this State either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at his residence, if known, and upon each party residing out of the State by mailing a copy to him at his residence, if known.  In the event that the residence of any party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the land is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made at least 10 days before the date fixed for such hearing. Whenever under the "Eminent Domain Act of 1971" the amount of the award may be paid into court, payment may be made into the Superior Court and may be distributed according to law.  The corporation shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which it has taken possession of the land or property as herein provided; (l)  To make and enter into all contracts and agreements necessary or incidental to the performance of its duties and the execution of its powers under this act; (m)  To appoint such additional officers, who need not be members of the corporation as the corporation deems advisable, and to employ consulting engineers, attorneys, accountants, construction and financial experts, superintendents, managers, and such other employees and agents as may be necessary in its judgment; to fix their compensation; and to promote and discharge such officers, employees and agents; all without regard to the provisions of Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes; provided, however that in the hiring of any employees or agents the corporation shall hire any full-time employees of the Camden Marine Terminals or of the South Jersey Port Commission, dissolved as hereinafter provided by this act, who express a desire to be employed by the corporation; and provided further, that the corporation shall provide for the protection and maintenance of any contract, agreement or memorandum of understanding concerning wages, working conditions or benefits of any nature whatsoever between said Camden Marine Terminals or South Jersey Port Commission and such employees or their designated representative, and the corporation shall guarantee any pension rights or benefits, including membership in any State, private or other pension plan, of any such employees of the Camden Marine Terminals or the South Jersey Port Commission; (n)  To apply for, receive and accept from any federal agency, subject to the approval of the Governor, grants for or in aid of the planning or construction of any marine terminal, and to receive and accept aid or contributions from any source, of either money, property, labor or other things of value, to be held, used and applied only for the purposes for which such grants and contributions may be made; (o)  To acquire any lands under water in the State of New Jersey for marine terminal, purposes by grant, transfer or conveyance from the Resource Development Council in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development in accordance with the statutes of the State governing the making of riparian grants and leases, upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by said council; (p)  To acquire any real property required or used for State highway purposes in the State of New Jersey, by grant, transfer or conveyance from the State Department of Transportation of the State of New Jersey upon such terms and  conditions as may be determined by said State Department of Transportation;

(cf: P.L.1993, c.190, s.4) 9.    Section 1 of P.L.2008, c.1 (C.23:2B-20) is amended to read as follows: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that each spring more than a million shorebirds of six species, including the red knot, ruddy turnstone, sanderling, semipalmated sandpiper, short-billed dowitcher, and dunlin, stop at [Delaware] Bay of New Jersey beaches and feed upon horseshoe crab eggs; that the red knot was once considered one of New Jersey's most abundant shorebirds; that this critical food source of horseshoe crab eggs consumed during the stopover of the red knot in New Jersey and Delaware is needed for the birds to gain sufficient weight to continue their migration north to breeding grounds in the Canadian Arctic, survive until food becomes available, and successfully reproduce ; that surveys have shown that red knots migrating through the bay region have declined by more than 75 percent since 2000; and that state and international biologists fear that the red knot will become extinct as soon as 2010. The Legislature further finds and declares that the numbers of shorebirds other than the red knots that feed on horseshoe crab eggs on the [Delaware] Bay of New Jersey have declined by a highly significant 64 percent during the period of 1998 through 2007. The Legislature further finds and declares that shorebird populations have continued to decline, despite the fact that over the past two decades more than $3 million in public funds have been spent on the protection and restoration of shorebird populations and their habitats on [New Jersey's Delaware] Bay of New Jersey shore. The Legislature therefore determines that a moratorium on the harvest, landing and possession of horseshoe crabs is critical to ensure that more horseshoe crab eggs will be available as a food source, thus increasing the likelihood of survival of these shorebirds.

In any condemnation proceeding in connection with the acquisition by the authority of property or property rights of any character in either state and the right of inspection and immediate entry thereon, through the exercise by it of its power of eminent domain, any existing or future law or rule of court of the state in which such property is located with respect to the condemnation of property for the construction, reconstruction and maintenance of highways therein, shall control.  The authority shall have the same power and authority with respect thereto as the state agency named in any such law; provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring joint or concurrent action by the two states with respect to the enactment, repeal or amendment of any law or rule of court on the subject of condemnation under which the authority may proceed by virtue of this article.

The power of the authority to acquire property by condemnation shall be a continuing power, and no exercise thereof shall be deemed to exhaust it.

STATEMENT This bill renames the Delaware Bay as the Bay of New Jersey in all statutes and official references under New Jersey law.  The bill directs all State departments, agencies, and instrumentalities to revise their websites, printed materials, signage, maps, and other public-facing documents to reflect this new designation. Additionally, it requires that any reference to Delaware Bay in New Jersey statutes, rules, regulations, contracts, or official documents be understood to mean and refer to the Bay of New Jersey. The bill also requires that relevant federal agencies be notified of the name change, including requests to reflect this designation in federal documents and materials where appropriate. The Delaware Bay lies along the western border of southern New Jersey and has long been integral to the States environmental, economic, and cultural identity.  The renaming recognizes and affirms the bays strong and direct connection to New Jerseys coastal communities, maritime industries, and natural resources.

Upon the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the compensation to be paid thereunder shall be ascertained and paid in the manner provided in the "Eminent Domain Act of 1971," P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-1 et seq.), insofar as the provisions thereof are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions contained in this act. The  corporation may join in separate subdivisions in one petition or complaint the descriptions of any number of tracts or parcels of land or property to be condemned and the names of any number of owners and other parties who may have an interest therein and all such land or property included in said petition or complaint may be condemned in a single proceeding; provided, however, that separate awards be made for each tract or parcel of land or property; and provided further, that each of said tracts or parcels of land or property lies wholly in or has a substantial part of its value lying wholly within the same county. Upon the filing of such petition or complaint or at any time thereafter the corporation may file with the clerk of the county in which such property is located and also with the Clerk of the Superior Court a declaration of taking, signed by the corporation declaring that possession of one or more of the  tracts or parcels of land or property described in the petition or complaint is thereby being taken by and for the use of the corporation.  The said declaration of taking shall be sufficient if it sets forth (1) a description of each tract or parcel of land or property to be so taken sufficient for the identification thereof to which there shall be attached a plan or map thereof;  (2) a statement of the estate or interest in the said land or property being taken; (3) a statement of the sum of money estimated by the corporation by  resolution to be just compensation for the taking of the estate or interest in each tract or parcel of land or property described in said declaration; and (4) that, in compliance with the provisions of this act, the corporation has established and is maintaining a trust fund as hereinafter provided. Upon the filing of the said declaration, the corporation shall deposit with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration.  In addition to the said deposits with the Clerk of the Superior Court the corporation at all times shall maintain a special trust fund on deposit with a bank or trust company doing business in this State in an  account at least equal to twice the aggregate amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court.  Said trust fund shall consist of cash or securities readily convertible into cash constituting legal investment for trust funds under the laws of this State.  Said trust fund shall be held solely to secure and may be applied to the payment of just compensation for the land or other property described in such declarations of taking.  The corporation shall be entitled to withdraw from said trust fund from time to time so much as may then be in excess of twice the aggregate of the amount deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court as estimated compensation for all property described in declarations of taking with respect to which the compensation has not been finally determined  and paid to the persons entitled thereto or into court. Upon the filing of the said declaration as aforesaid and depositing with the Clerk of the Superior Court the amount of the estimated compensation stated in said declaration, the corporation without other process or proceedings, shall be entitled to the exclusive possession and use of each tract of land or property described in said declaration and may forthwith enter into and take possession of said land or property, it being the intent of this provision that the proceedings for compensation or any other proceedings relating to the taking of said land or interest therein or other property shall not delay the taking of possession thereof and the use thereof by the corporation for the  purpose or purposes for which the corporation is authorized by law to acquire or condemn such land or other property or interest therein. The corporation shall cause notice of the filing of said declaration and the making of said deposit to be served upon each party in interest named in the petition residing in this State, either personally or by leaving a copy thereof  at his residence, if known, and upon each party in interest residing out of the State, by mailing a copy thereof to him at his residence, if known.  In the event that the residence of any such party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the land is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made within 10 days after filing such  declaration.  Upon the application of any party in interest and after notice to other parties in interest, including the corporation, any judge of the Superior Court assigned to sit for said county may order that the money deposited with the Clerk of the Superior Court or any part thereof be paid forthwith to the person or persons entitled thereto for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in said proceeding; provided, that each such person shall have filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court a consent in writing that, in the event the award in the condemnation proceeding shall be less than the amount deposited, the court, after notice as herein provided and hearing, may determine his liability, if any, for the return of such difference or any part  thereof and enter judgment therefor.  If the amount of the award as finally determined shall exceed the amount so deposited, the person or persons to whom the award is payable shall be entitled to recover from the corporation the difference between the amount of the deposit and the amount of the award, with interest at the rate of 6% per annum thereon from the date of making the deposit.  If the amount of the award shall be less than the amount so deposited, the Clerk of the Superior Court shall return the difference between the amount of the award and the deposit to the corporation unless the amount of the deposit or any part thereof shall have theretofore been distributed, in  which event the court, on petition of the corporation and notice to all persons interested in the award and affording them an opportunity to be heard, shall enter judgment in favor of the corporation for such difference against the party or parties liable for the return thereof.  The corporation shall cause notice of the date fixed for such hearing to be served upon each party thereto residing in this State either personally or by leaving a copy thereof at his residence, if known, and upon each party residing out of the State by mailing a copy to him at his residence, if known.  In the event that the residence of any party or the name of such party is unknown, such notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper published or circulating in the county or counties in which the land is located.  Such service, mailing or publication shall be made at least 10 days before the date fixed for such hearing. Whenever under the "Eminent Domain Act of 1971" the amount of the award may be paid into court, payment may be made into the Superior Court and may be distributed according to law.  The corporation shall not abandon any condemnation proceeding subsequent to the date upon which it has taken possession of the land or property as herein provided; (l)  To make and enter into all contracts and agreements necessary or incidental to the performance of its duties and the execution of its powers under this act; (m)  To appoint such additional officers, who need not be members of the corporation as the corporation deems advisable, and to employ consulting engineers, attorneys, accountants, construction and financial experts, superintendents, managers, and such other employees and agents as may be necessary in its judgment; to fix their compensation; and to promote and discharge such officers, employees and agents; all without regard to the provisions of Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes; provided, however that in the hiring of any employees or agents the corporation shall hire any full-time employees of the Camden Marine Terminals or of the South Jersey Port Commission, dissolved as hereinafter provided by this act, who express a desire to be employed by the corporation; and provided further, that the corporation shall provide for the protection and maintenance of any contract, agreement or memorandum of understanding concerning wages, working conditions or benefits of any nature whatsoever between said Camden Marine Terminals or South Jersey Port Commission and such employees or their designated representative, and the corporation shall guarantee any pension rights or benefits, including membership in any State, private or other pension plan, of any such employees of the Camden Marine Terminals or the South Jersey Port Commission; (n)  To apply for, receive and accept from any federal agency, subject to the approval of the Governor, grants for or in aid of the planning or construction of any marine terminal, and to receive and accept aid or contributions from any source, of either money, property, labor or other things of value, to be held, used and applied only for the purposes for which such grants and contributions may be made;

(cf: P.L.1993, c.190, s.4) 9.    Section 1 of P.L.2008, c.1 (C.23:2B-20) is amended to read as follows: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that each spring more than a million shorebirds of six species, including the red knot, ruddy turnstone, sanderling, semipalmated sandpiper, short-billed dowitcher, and dunlin, stop at [Delaware] Bay of New Jersey beaches and feed upon horseshoe crab eggs; that the red knot was once considered one of New Jersey's most abundant shorebirds; that this critical food source of horseshoe crab eggs consumed during the stopover of the red knot in New Jersey and Delaware is needed for the birds to gain sufficient weight to continue their migration north to breeding grounds in the Canadian Arctic, survive until food becomes available, and successfully reproduce ; that surveys have shown that red knots migrating through the bay region have declined by more than 75 percent since 2000; and that state and international biologists fear that the red knot will become extinct as soon as 2010. The Legislature further finds and declares that the numbers of shorebirds other than the red knots that feed on horseshoe crab eggs on the [Delaware] Bay of New Jersey have declined by a highly significant 64 percent during the period of 1998 through 2007. The Legislature further finds and declares that shorebird populations have continued to decline, despite the fact that over the past two decades more than $3 million in public funds have been spent on the protection and restoration of shorebird populations and their habitats on [New Jersey's Delaware] Bay of New Jersey shore. The Legislature therefore determines that a moratorium on the harvest, landing and possession of horseshoe crabs is critical to ensure that more horseshoe crab eggs will be available as a food source, thus increasing the likelihood of survival of these shorebirds. (cf: P.L.2008, c.1, s.1) 10.  Section 8 of P.L.1996, c.112 (C.23:3-12.2) is amended to read as follows: 8. a. There is established within the "hunters' and anglers' license fund," created pursuant to the provisions of R.S.23:3-11 and R.S.23:3-12, a separate and dedicated account to be known as the "Oyster Resource Development Account."  This account shall be credited with all revenues received from oysters landed from the Delaware River, [Delaware] Bay of New Jersey and their tributaries, including, but not limited to, all fees collected pursuant to R.S.50:1-18, R.S.50:3-2, and section 4 of P.L.1945, c.39 (C.50:3-20.13), and as provided in subsection c. of this section.  The moneys in the account shall be allocated to the Division of Fish and Wildlife within the Department of Environmental Protection and shall be disbursed only for the enhancement and management of the oyster resource in the [Delaware] Bay of New Jersey in the amounts and manner prescribed by the commissioner, after consultation with the [Delaware] Bay of New Jersey Section of the Shellfisheries Council. b.    The Department of Environmental Protection shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations necessary to administer the "Oyster Resource Development Account," established pursuant to subsection a. of this section. c.     Upon the adoption of the rules and regulations pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the Department of Environmental Protection shall repeal subchapter 4 of chapter 25A of Title 7 of the New Jersey Administrative Code establishing the "oyster cultch program" and the "Oyster Cultch Fund." The balance of the moneys remaining in the "Oyster Cultch Fund" upon the date of the repeal of the rules and regulations establishing the fund shall be deposited in the "Oyster Resource Development Account," established pursuant to subsection a. of this section. (cf: P.L.2007, c.338, s.4) 11.  R.S.23:3-51 is amended to read as follows: 23:3-51. a.

This subsection shall not be understood to prohibit the taking of menhaden in State coastal waters for the use as bait for commercial or recreational purposes or in whole frozen form for use as human food. c. (1) The following types of vessels, and their owners or operators, are subject to licensure pursuant to this section: (a)   Any purse seine catch vessel that takes menhaden from State waters on an individual trip basis; and (b)   Any purse seine carry vessel that works in conjunction with the purse seine catch vessel identified in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph. (2)   A menhaden set vessel that participates only in the setting of a purse seine or shirred net in conjunction with a purse seine catch vessel is exempt from licensure pursuant to this section. (3)   A license issued pursuant to this section shall remain on board the licensed vessel at all times. (4)   The holder of a license issued pursuant to this section shall not use, have on board the licensed vessel, or work in conjunction with any other vessel that uses any type of fishing gear other than a purse seine or shirred net. d.    A Menhaden Purse Seine Fishing Vessel License shall be issued in the name of the vessel and the vessel's owner or owner/operator.  If the vessel owner is not the operator of the vessel, a Menhaden Purse Seine Fishing Vessel License shall be issued to the vessel owner, as provided in this paragraph, and a separate Menhaden Purse Seine Fishing Vessel Operator's License shall be issued to, and in the name of, the vessel operator, in accordance with the provisions of this section and subsection c. of R.S.23:3-52. e. (1) No vessel licensed pursuant to this section shall be greater than 90 feet in overall length. (2)   Whenever a Menhaden Purse Seine Fishing Vessel License is issued for a menhaden purse seine catch vessel pursuant to this section, the licensee shall provide the commissioner with certified baseline data indicating the overall length and horsepower of the vessel.  Any upgrade or replacement of a licensed purse seine catch vessel shall be limited to a 10 percent increase in overall vessel length, and a 20 percent increase in horsepower. f.     The possession of any fish other than menhaden on a vessel licensed under this section is limited to no more than 500 pounds.  The simultaneous possession aboard a vessel of a purse seine or shirred net, menhaden, and any other fish in an amount greater than 500 pounds shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection. g. (1) Before commencing menhaden fishing activities on any given day, a person licensed under this section shall notify the department, by phone or, if applicable and offered by the department, by electronic means, of the intention to fish under this section, and the vessel's intended fishing location.  The licensee shall also notify the department, by phone or, if applicable and offered by the department, by electronic means, of any anticipated change in the vessel's fishing location.  After a licensee has provided notice to the department of their intention to fish for menhaden pursuant to this section on any particular day, the licensee shall be limited, on that day, to the use of a purse seine or shirred net. (2)   Fishing for menhaden pursuant to this section shall be restricted to those areas in the Raritan, Sandy Hook, and [Delaware Bays] the Bay of New Jersey, and in the Atlantic Ocean, which are located at a distance of 0.6 nautical miles or more from the New Jersey coastline and the jetties and fishing piers extending therefrom. (3)   Fishing for menhaden in the [Delaware] Bay of New Jersey shall be further restricted to those areas of the Bay that lie south and east of LORAN C line 42850, or to any other area of the Bay, as may be designated by the commissioner. (4)   It shall be incumbent upon the vessel operator to determine whether a purse seine or shirred net is likely to drift, during fishing, beyond the fishing boundaries established by this subsection.  The drifting of a purse seine or shirred net into any restricted area along the shore or around a jetty or pier while fishing shall constitute a violation of this subsection. h.    No person engaged in the act of fishing pursuant to this section shall disturb any:  (a) channel designating stakes, markers, or buoys; (b) crab pots, lobster pots, fish pots, or traps; or (c) staked and leased shellfish grounds. (cf: P.L.2013, c.74, s.2) 12.  Section 1 of P.L.1979, c.227 (C.23:3-72) is amended to read as follows: No person shall take more than 25 American eels (anguilla rostrata) per day from the waters of [Delaware bay] the Bay of New Jersey and its tributaries in this State without first having obtained a valid commercial eel fishing license from the division.  The fee for such license shall be $100.00 for residents of this State;  for  nonresidents, the fee for such license shall be the same as the fee charged to  New Jersey residents by the state of residence of the license purchaser for a  comparable license, but shall not be less than $100.00.  Any license issued pursuant to this section shall be void after December 31 next succeeding its  issuance. (cf: P.L.1979, c.227, s.1) 13.  Section 2 of P.L.1979, c.227 (C.23:3-73) is amended to read as follows: The Director of the Division of Fish, Game and Shellfisheries, with the approval of the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, is hereby authorized to adopt, amend and repeal, pursuant to the  "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c. 410 (C. 52:14B-1 et seq.), such rules and regulations as are necessary and proper in order to provide for the conservation, protection and management of the eel resource in the waters of [Delaware bay] the Bay of New Jersey and its tributaries in this State.

STATEMENT This bill renames the Delaware Bay as the Bay of New Jersey in all statutes and official references under New Jersey law.  The bill directs all State departments, agencies, and instrumentalities to revise their websites, printed materials, signage, maps, and other public-facing documents to reflect this new designation. Additionally, it requires that any reference to Delaware Bay in New Jersey statutes, rules, regulations, contracts, or official documents be understood to mean and refer to the Bay of New Jersey. The bill also requires that relevant federal agencies be notified of the name change, including requests to reflect this designation in federal documents and materials where appropriate. The Delaware Bay lies along the western border of southern New Jersey and has long been integral to the States environmental, economic, and cultural identity.  The renaming recognizes and affirms the bays strong and direct connection to New Jerseys coastal communities, maritime industries, and natural resources.
