A plenary retail consumption license is an alcoholic beverage retail license issued for use by bars and restaurants that allows consumption of alcoholic beverages on the licensed premises. Under current law, a municipality may issue plenary retail consumption licenses until the combined total number in the municipality is fewer than one license for each 3,000 persons.  Because of these restrictions, there is a shortage of these licenses in some municipalities.  This bill addresses this shortage by allowing a municipality to issue additional licenses through a public bidding process. Under the bill, fifty percent of the fee paid by the highest qualifying bidder would be paid to the municipality that issued the license and the remaining fifty percent would be divided equally among and paid to the plenary retail consumption licensees in the municipality in which the licensed premises is located.
