Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.   Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.1 et seq.) to the contrary, periods of time set forth for county planning board review and approval of subdivisions and site plans, and periods of time for rendering a decision on the appeal of an action taken by a county planning board, or by a planning director and a committee of the board, shall be suspended and not run while a state of emergency is in effect, and until 60 days after the conclusion of the state of emergency.  During such time, no application submitted to a county planning board shall be deemed approved due to the inaction of the county planning board. b.    As used in this section: State of emergency means a state of emergency declared by the President of the United States, a state of emergency declared by the Governor of this State pursuant to P.L.1942, c.251 (C.App.A.9-33 et seq.), or a public health emergency declared by the Governor of this State pursuant to the "Emergency Health Powers Act," P.L.2005, c.222 (C.26:13-1 et seq.). 2.    This act shall take effect immediately.
