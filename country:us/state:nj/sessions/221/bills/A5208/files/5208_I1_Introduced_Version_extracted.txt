A5208 ASSEMBLY, No. 5208 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JANUARY 16, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  NANCY F. MUÑOZ District 21 (Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union) SYNOPSIS Comprehensive Reimbursement and Duration of Leave Expansion Act; increases family leave insurance benefits and leave duration for child bonding. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning family temporary disability leave, amending parts of the statutory law, and supplementing P.L.1948, c.110. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. (New section) This act shall be known and may be cited as the Comprehensive Reimbursement and Duration of Leave Expansion Act or CRADLE Act. 2. (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.    New Jersey recognizes that comprehensive parental leave policies are crucial for the well-being of children and families. The average length of parental leave in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries is 33 weeks, with most countries offering between 26 and 52 weeks of leave. New Jersey has been a leader in paid family leave insurance, but further expansion is necessary to ensure the State keeps pace with evolving family needs and scientific recommendations. b.    Extensions of paid maternity leave have been associated with improvements in a variety of metrics including: (1)   Postpartum depression.  In Hong Kong, a nationally mandated four-week extension of maternity leave was associated with a 22 percent decrease in the number of mothers experiencing postnatal depression symptoms. (2)   Infant mortality rates.  Multiple studies have found that a 10-week extension of maternity leave is associated with a significant decrease in infant mortality rates, upwards of three percent in OECD countries. (3)   Socioeconomic and health outcomes.  Globally, an increase of 10 weeks of maternity leave at full pay was associated with a 10 percent decrease in neonatal and infant mortality. (4) Female participation in the workforce.  Domestically, Google lowered attrition rates by over 50 percent for postpartum employees by increasing their paid parental leave from three to five months and offering full-pay wage replacement.  A multi-country analysis spanning two decades found that an increase in the duration of paid leave, from an average of 10 weeks to 33 weeks, was associated with an increase in the female employment ratio by over two percent. (5) Breastfeeding duration.  In Chile, a national extension of maternity leave from 12 to 24 weeks increased rates of exclusive breastfeeding at six months of age by 43 percent. c.    The World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends six months of exclusive breastfeeding for newborns optimal development and health.  Breastfeeding can improve infant immunity and lower the risks of diseases including respiratory infections, asthma, and diabetes.  There is a strong and well-studied correlation between women returning to work and breastfeeding cessation.  Women receiving at least 12 weeks of leave were more likely to initiate and maintain breastfeeding for at least six months. This is particularly pronounced in low-income women who have the lowest rates of exclusive breastfeeding at six months in the United States. d.    Postpartum depression affects at least 16,000 women in New Jersey each year.  Untreated postpartum depression can cause intense feelings of sadness, anxiety, and poor infant-mother bonding, which can, in its most serious forms, progress into self-harm, suicidal, or filicidal ideations or actions. While there are many biological factors that affect postpartum depression risk including hormone levels and a family history of depression, sociocultural factors such as financial stress, domestic violence, and poor societal support have also been associated with heightened risk for postpartum depression.  There is a wealth of empirical data that maternity leave times, especially those over 12 weeks in length, are associated with decreased rates of postpartum depression symptoms. e.    Paid parental leave allows families to care for their infants at home for longer, increasing the likelihood of accessing necessary healthcare and avoiding the increased risk of illness associated with attending childcare.  Implementation of New Yorks paid family leave policy was associated with an 18 percent decrease in doctors visits for respiratory infections in young infants.  Infants of mothers returning to work within 12 weeks of birth experience a decrease in the likelihood of attending a well-baby visit, and in receiving timely immunizations.  These effects on wellbeing may last beyond infancy, with children of mothers that returned to work within 12 weeks of birth showing an increased incidence of behavioral problems in early childhood. f.     In 2023, the 75th percentile for full-time infant care in New Jersey was $1,750, which was 13 percent higher than the Statewide average weekly wage.  Aside from savings in childcare costs, paid parental leave stabilizes womens employment status and income.  It is reported that women who took paid maternity leave were up to 40 percent less likely to receive public assistance in the year following childbirth, even when controlling for variables such as wage, education attainment, and age.  Paid parental leave may also have long-lasting benefits, especially for women.  Poverty in old age is heavily skewed towards women, due to longer lifespans, lower workforce participation, lower wages, and lower pensions or retirement contributions compared to men.  Enabling women to stay in paid work may help mitigate the high levels of old age poverty for women in the future. g.    High rates of reimbursement reaffirm that care work is socially valued.  Unpaid care work largely falls on women and reinforces socioeconomic disadvantages.  In New Jersey, women made up about 70 percent of all individuals who took caregiving leave in 2022.  A review of global family leave policies notes that: When leave policies replace only a small share of income, the lower earner in a household  disproportionately women due to persisting gender wage gaps  will be more likely to take it. Moreover, low wage replacement rates exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities since workers with lower incomes and fewer assets will be less able to afford a reduction in pay. 3.  Section 4 of P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-4) is amended to read as follows: 4.    An employee of an employer in this State subject to the provisions of [this act] P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) shall be entitled to a family leave of 12 weeks, or the number of weeks for which the employee elects to take benefits pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 16 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-40), in any 24-month period upon advance notice to the employer in the manner specified by the provisions of sections 11 and 12 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.2 and 43:21-39.3), unless the employer denies family leave to the employee pursuant to subsection h. of this section. a.     In the case of a family member who has a serious health condition, the leave may be taken intermittently when medically necessary, in the manner specified by the provisions of section 11 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.2). b.    In the case of the foster care placement, birth or adoption of a healthy child, the leave may be taken intermittently in the manner specified by the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 12 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.3). c.     Leave taken because of the birth or placement for adoption of a child may commence at any time within a year after the date of the foster care placement, birth or placement for adoption. d.    Family leave required by [this act] P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) may be paid, unpaid, or a combination of paid and unpaid leave.  If an employer provides paid family leave for fewer than 12 workweeks, the additional weeks of leave added to attain the 12-workweek total required by [this act] P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) may be unpaid. e.     An employer may require that any period of family leave be supported by certification issued by a duly licensed health care provider or any other health care provider determined by the director to be capable of providing adequate certification as described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, or where the leave is for an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to a communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of a communicable disease, certification issued by a school, place of care for children, public health authority, public official, or health care provider, as described in paragraph (3) of this subsection. (1)   Where the certification is for the serious health condition of a family member of the employee, the certification shall be sufficient if it states: (a) the date on which the serious health condition commenced; (b) the probable duration of the condition; and (c) the medical facts within the provider's knowledge regarding the condition; (2)   Where the certification is for the birth or placement of the child, the certification need only state the date of birth or date of placement, whichever is appropriate; (3)   Where the certification is for an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of the communicable disease, the certification shall be sufficient if it includes: (a)   for leave taken to provide in-home care or treatment of a child due to the closure of the school or place of care of the child of the employee, by order of a public official due to the epidemic or other public health emergency, the date on which the closure of the school or place of care of the child of the employee commenced and the reason for such closure; (b)   for leave taken due to a public health authority's issuance of a determination requiring or imposing responsive or prophylactic measures as a result of illness caused by an epidemic of a communicable disease or known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease because the presence in the community of a family member in need of care by the employee would jeopardize the health of others, the date of issuance of the determination and the probable duration of the determination; or (c)   for leave taken because a health care provider or public health authority recommends that a family member in need of care by the employee voluntarily undergo self-quarantine as a result of suspected exposure to a communicable disease because the presence in the community of that family member in need of care by the employee would jeopardize the health of others, the date of the recommendation, the probable duration of the condition, and the medical or other facts within the health care provider or public health authority's knowledge regarding the condition. In any case in which the employer has reason to doubt the validity of the certification provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the employer may require, at its own expense, that an employee obtain an opinion regarding the serious health condition from a second health care provider designated or approved, but not employed on a regular basis, by the employer. If the second opinion differs from the certification provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the employer may require, at its own expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider designated or approved jointly by the employer and the employee concerning the serious health condition.  The opinion of the third health care provider shall be considered to be final and shall be binding on the employer and the employee. f.     In any case in which the necessity for leave under [this act] P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) is foreseeable, based upon placement of a child into foster care an expected birth or placement of the child for adoption, the employee shall provide the employer with prior notice of the expected birth or placement of the child for adoption or foster care in the manner specified by the provisions of section 11 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.2). g.    No employee shall, during any period of leave taken pursuant to this section, perform services on a full-time basis for any person for whom the employee did not provide those services immediately prior to commencement of the leave. h.    An employer may deny family leave to the employee if: (1)   The employee is a salaried employee who is among the highest paid five% of the employer's employees or the seven highest paid employees of the employer, whichever is greater; (2)   The denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the employer's operations; and (3)   The employer notifies the employee of its intent to deny the leave at the time the employer determines that the denial is necessary. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply when, in the event of a state of emergency declared by the Governor or when indicated to be needed by the Commissioner of Health or other public health authority, the family leave is for an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to a communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of a communicable disease. i.     In any case in which the leave has already commenced at the time of the notification pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection h. of this section, the employee shall return to work within 10 working days of the date of notification. j.     In the case of leave taken due to an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of the communicable disease, the leave may be taken intermittently if: (1) the covered individual provides the employer with prior notice of the leave as soon as practicable; and (2) the covered individual makes a reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the operations of the employer and, if possible, provide the employer, prior to the commencement of the intermittent leave, with a regular schedule of the day or days of the week on which the intermittent leave will be taken. (cf: P.L.2020, c.23, s.2) 4.    R.S.43:21-7 is amended to read as follows: 43:21-7.  Employers other than governmental entities, whose benefit financing provisions are set forth in section 4 of P.L.1971, c.346 (C.43:21-7.3), and those nonprofit organizations liable for payment in lieu of contributions on the basis set forth in section 3 of P.L.1971, c.346 (C.43:21-7.2), shall pay to the controller for the unemployment compensation fund, contributions as set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c) hereof, and the provisions of subsections (d) and (e) shall be applicable to all employers, consistent with the provisions of the "unemployment compensation law" and the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.). (a)   Payment. (1)   Contributions shall accrue and become payable by each employer for each calendar year in which he is subject to this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), with respect to having individuals in his employ during that calendar year, at the rates and on the basis hereinafter set forth. Such contributions shall become due and be paid by each employer to the controller for the fund, in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed, and shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in his employ. (2)   In the payment of any contributions, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to $0.005 or more, in which case it shall be increased to $0.01. (b)   Rate of contributions. Each employer shall pay the following contributions: (1)   For the calendar year 1947, and each calendar year thereafter, 2 7/10% of wages paid by him during each such calendar year, except as otherwise prescribed by subsection (c) of this section. (2)   The "wages" of any individual, with respect to any one employer, as the term is used in this subsection (b) and in subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section 7, shall include the first $4,800.00 paid during calendar year 1975, for services performed either within or without this State; provided that no contribution shall be required by this State with respect to services performed in another state if such other state imposes contribution liability with respect thereto.  If an employer (hereinafter referred to as a successor employer) during any calendar year acquires substantially all the property used in a trade or business of another employer (hereinafter referred to as a predecessor), or used in a separate unit of a trade or business of a predecessor, and immediately after the acquisition employs in his trade or business an individual who immediately prior to the acquisition was employed in the trade or business of such predecessors, then, for the purpose of determining whether the successor employer has paid wages with respect to employment equal to the first $4,800.00 paid during calendar year 1975, any wages paid to such individual by such predecessor during such calendar year and prior to such acquisition shall be considered as having been paid by such successor employer. (3)   For calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 1976, the "wages" of any individual, as defined in the preceding paragraph (2) of this subsection (b), shall be established and promulgated by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development on or before September 1 of the preceding year and, except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection (b), shall be, 28 times the Statewide average weekly remuneration paid to workers by employers, as determined under R.S.43:21-3(c), raised to the next higher multiple of $100.00 if not already a multiple thereof, provided that if the amount of wages so determined for a calendar year is less than the amount similarly determined for the preceding year, the greater amount will be used; provided, further, that if the amount of such wages so determined does not equal or exceed the amount of wages as defined in subsection (b) of section 3306 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.3306(b)), the wages as determined in this paragraph in any calendar year shall be raised to equal the amount established under the "Federal Unemployment Tax Act," chapter 23 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.3301 et seq.), for that calendar year. (4)   For calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2020, the "wages" of any individual, as defined in the preceding paragraph (2) of this subsection (b) for purposes of contributions of workers to the State disability benefits fund, including the "Family Temporary Disability Leave Account" pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, shall be established and promulgated by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development on or before September 1 of the preceding year and shall be 107 times the Statewide average weekly remuneration paid to workers by employers, as determined under R.S.43:21-3(c), raised to the next higher multiple of $100.00 if not already a multiple thereof, provided that if the amount of wages so determined for a calendar year is less than the amount similarly determined for the preceding year, the greater amount will be used, except that the limit of 107 times the Statewide average weekly remuneration shall not apply during any year commencing on or after January 1, 2026, and any wages then exceeding that limit shall be regarded as wages in the same manner as wages not exceeding that limit for the purposes of determining the amount of wages subject to contributions. (c)   Future rates based on benefit experience. (1)   A separate account for each employer shall be maintained and this shall be credited with all the contributions which he has paid on his own behalf on or before January 31 of any calendar year with respect to employment occurring in the preceding calendar year; provided, however, that if January 31 of any calendar year falls on a Saturday or Sunday, an employer's account shall be credited as of January 31 of such calendar year with all the contributions which he has paid on or before the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday or Sunday. But nothing in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.) shall be construed to grant any employer or individuals in his service prior claims or rights to the amounts paid by him into the fund either on his own behalf or on behalf of such individuals. Benefits paid with respect to benefit years commencing on and after January 1, 1953, to any individual on or before December 31 of any calendar year with respect to unemployment in such calendar year and in preceding calendar years shall be charged against the account or accounts of the employer or employers in whose employment such individual established base weeks constituting the basis of such benefits, except that, with respect to benefit years commencing after January 4, 1998, an employer's account shall not be charged for benefits paid to a claimant if: (1) the claimant's employment by that employer was ended in any way which, pursuant to subsection (a), (b), (c), (f), (g) or (h) of R.S.43:21-5, would have disqualified the claimant for benefits if the claimant had applied for benefits at the time when that employment ended, or (2) the claimants employment by that employer continued and the claimant continued to both perform work for and receive remuneration from that employer, during the claimants period of unemployment.  Benefits paid under a given benefit determination shall be charged against the account of the employer to whom such determination relates.  When each benefit payment is made, notification shall be promptly provided to each employer included in the unemployment insurance monetary calculation of benefits.  Such notification shall identify the employer against whose account the amount of such payment is being charged, shall show at least the name and social security account number of the claimant and shall specify the period of unemployment to which said benefit payment applies. An annual summary statement of unemployment benefits charged to the employer's account shall be provided. (2)   Regulations may be prescribed for the establishment, maintenance, and dissolution of joint accounts by two or more employers, and shall, in accordance with such regulations and upon application by two or more employers to establish such an account, or to merge their several individual accounts in a joint account, maintain such joint account as if it constituted a single employer's account. (3)   No employer's rate shall be lower than 5.4% unless assignment of such lower rate is consistent with the conditions applicable to additional credit allowance for such year under section 3303(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.3303(a)(1)), any other provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding. (4)   Employer Reserve Ratio. (A)  Each employer's rate shall be 2 8/10%, except as otherwise provided in the following provisions.  No employer's rate for the 12 months commencing July 1 of any calendar year shall be other than 2 8/10%, unless as of the preceding January 31 such employer shall have paid contributions with respect to wages paid in each of the three calendar years immediately preceding such year, in which case such employer's rate for the 12 months commencing July 1 of any calendar year shall be determined on the basis of his record up to the beginning of such calendar year. If, at the beginning of such calendar year, the total of all his contributions, paid on his own behalf, for all past years exceeds the total benefits charged to his account for all such years, his contribution rate shall be: (1)   2 5/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 4%, but less than 5%, of his average annual payroll (as defined in paragraph (2), subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-19); (2)   2 2/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 5%, but is less than 6%, of his average annual payroll; (3)   1 9/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 6%, but is less than 7%, of his average annual payroll; (4)   1 6/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 7%, but is less than 8%, of his average annual payroll; (5)   1 3/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 8%, but is less than 9%, of his average annual payroll; (6)   1%, if such excess equals or exceeds 9%, but is less than 10%, of his average annual payroll; (7)   7/10 of 1%, if such excess equals or exceeds 10%, but is less than 11%, of his average annual payroll; (8)   4/10 of 1%, if such excess equals or exceeds 11% of his average annual payroll. (B)  If the total of an employer's contributions, paid on his own behalf, for all past periods for the purposes of this paragraph (4), is less than the total benefits charged against his account during the same period, his rate shall be: (1)   4%, if such excess is less than 10% of his average annual payroll; (2)   4 3/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 10%, but is less than 20%, of his average annual payroll; (3)   4 6/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 20% of his average annual payroll. (C)  Specially assigned rates. (i)    If no contributions were paid on wages for employment in any calendar year used in determining the average annual payroll of an employer eligible for an assigned rate under this paragraph (4), the employer's rate shall be specially assigned as follows: if the reserve balance in its account is positive, its assigned rate shall be the highest rate in effect for positive balance accounts for that period, or 5.4%, whichever is higher, and if the reserve balance in its account is negative, its assigned rate shall be the highest rate in effect for deficit accounts for that period. (ii)   If, following the purchase of a corporation with little or no activity, known as a corporate shell, the resulting employing unit operates a new or different business activity, the employing unit shall be assigned a new employer rate. (iii) Entities operating under common ownership, management or control, when the operation of the entities is not identifiable, distinguishable and severable, shall be considered a single employer for the purposes of this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.). (D)  The contribution rates prescribed by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (4) shall be increased or decreased in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this subsection (c) for experience rating periods through June 30, 1986. (5)   (A) Unemployment Trust Fund Reserve Ratio. If on March 31 of any calendar year the balance in the unemployment trust fund equals or exceeds 4% but is less than 7% of the total taxable wages reported to the controller as of that date in respect to employment during the preceding calendar year, the contribution rate, effective July 1 following, of each employer eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be increased by 3/10 of 1% over the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection.  If on March 31 of any calendar year the balance of the unemployment trust fund exceeds 2 1/2% but is less than 4% of the total taxable wages reported to the controller as of that date in respect to employment during the preceding calendar year, the contribution rate, effective July 1 following, of each employer eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be increased by 6/10 of 1% over the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection. If on March 31 of any calendar year the balance of the unemployment trust fund is less than 2 1/2% of the total taxable wages reported to the controller as of that date in respect to employment during the preceding calendar year, the contribution rate, effective July 1 following, of each employer: (1) eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be increased by (i) 6/10 of 1% over the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraph (3), (4)(A) or (4)(B) of this subsection, and (ii) an additional amount equal to 20% of the total rate established herein, provided, however, that the final contribution rate for each employer shall be computed to the nearest multiple of 1/10% if not already a multiple thereof; (2) not eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be increased by 6/10 of 1% over the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection. For the period commencing July 1, 1984 and ending June 30, 1986, the contribution rate for each employer liable to pay contributions under R.S.43:21-7 shall be increased by a factor of 10% computed to the nearest multiple of 1/10% if not already a multiple thereof. (B)  If on March 31 of any calendar year the balance in the unemployment trust fund equals or exceeds 10% but is less than 12 1/2% of the total taxable wages reported to the controller as of that date in respect to employment during the preceding calendar year, the contribution rate, effective July 1 following, of each employer eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be reduced by 3/10 of 1% under the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection; provided that in no event shall the contribution rate of any employer be reduced to less than 4/10 of 1%. If on March 31 of any calendar year the balance in the unemployment trust fund equals or exceeds 12 1/2% of the total taxable wages reported to the controller as of that date in respect to employment during the preceding calendar year, the contribution rate, effective July 1 following, of each employer eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be reduced by 6/10 of 1% if his account for all past periods reflects an excess of contributions paid over total benefits charged of 3% or more of his average annual payroll, otherwise by 3/10 of 1% under the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection; provided that in no event shall the contribution rate of any employer be reduced to less than 4/10 of 1%. (C)  The "balance" in the unemployment trust fund, as the term is used in subparagraphs (A) and (B) above, shall not include moneys credited to the State's account under section 903 of the Social Security Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. s.1103), during any period in which such moneys are appropriated for the payment of expenses incurred in the administration of the "unemployment compensation law." (D)  Prior to July 1 of each calendar year the controller shall determine the Unemployment Trust Fund Reserve Ratio, which shall be calculated by dividing the balance of the unemployment trust fund as of the prior March 31 by total taxable wages reported to the controller by all employers as of March 31 with respect to their employment during the last calendar year.

(L)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (5) and notwithstanding the actual fund reserve ratio, the contribution rate for employers liable to pay contributions, as computed under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (5), shall be, for fiscal year 2011, the rates set by column "C" of the table in that subparagraph.

(Q)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (5) and notwithstanding the actual fund reserve ratio, the contribution rate for employers liable to pay contributions, as computed under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (5), shall be, for fiscal year 2024, the rates set by column "E" of the table in that subparagraph, unless the application of the provisions of this paragraph (5) using the actual fund reserve ratio would result in the contribution rate for employers being set by a column which has lower tax rates than the rates in column "E", in which case the employers shall be liable to pay contributions at the rates set by the column with the lower tax rates. (6)   Additional contributions. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any employer who has been assigned a contribution rate pursuant to subsection (c) of this section for the year commencing July 1, 1948, and for any year commencing July 1 thereafter, may voluntarily make payment of additional contributions, and upon such payment shall receive a recomputation of the experience rate applicable to such employer, including in the calculation the additional contribution so made, except that, following a transfer as described under R.S.43:21-7(c)(7)(D), neither the predecessor nor successor in interest shall be eligible to make a voluntary payment of additional contributions during the year the transfer occurs and the next full calendar year. Any such additional contribution shall be made during the 30-day period following the notification to the employer of his contribution rate as prescribed in this section, unless, for good cause, the time for payment has been extended by the controller for not to exceed an additional 60 days; provided that in no event may such payments which are made later than 120 days after the beginning of the year for which such rates are effective be considered in determining the experience rate for the year in which the payment is made. Any employer receiving any extended period of time within which to make such additional payment and failing to make such payment timely shall be, in addition to the required amount of additional payment, liable for a penalty of 5% thereof or $5.00, whichever is greater, not to exceed $50.00. Any adjustment under this subsection shall be made only in the form of credits against accrued or future contributions. (7)   Transfers. (A)  Upon the transfer of the organization, trade or business, or substantially all the assets of an employer to a successor in interest, whether by merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, descent or otherwise, the controller shall transfer the employment experience of the predecessor employer to the successor in interest, including credit for past years, contributions paid, annual payrolls, benefit charges, et cetera, applicable to such predecessor employer, pursuant to regulation, if it is determined that the employment experience of the predecessor employer with respect to the organization, trade, assets or business which has been transferred may be considered indicative of the future employment experience of the successor in interest.  The successor in interest may, within four months of the date of such transfer of the organization, trade, assets or business, or thereafter upon good cause shown, request a reconsideration of the transfer of employment experience of the predecessor employer.  The request for reconsideration shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the controller, that the employment experience of the predecessor is not indicative of the future employment experience of the successor. (B)  An employer who transfers part of his or its organization, trade, assets or business to a successor in interest, whether by merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, descent or otherwise, may jointly make application with such successor in interest for transfer of that portion of the employment experience of the predecessor employer relating to the portion of the organization, trade, assets or business transferred to the successor in interest, including credit for past years, contributions paid, annual payrolls, benefit charges, et cetera, applicable to such predecessor employer. The transfer of employment experience may be allowed pursuant to regulation only if it is found that the employment experience of the predecessor employer with respect to the portion of the organization, trade, assets or business which has been transferred may be considered indicative of the future employment experience of the successor in interest. Credit shall be given to the successor in interest only for the years during which contributions were paid by the predecessor employer with respect to that part of the organization, trade, assets or business transferred. (C)  A transfer of the employment experience in whole or in part having become final, the predecessor employer thereafter shall not be entitled to consideration for an adjusted rate based upon his or its experience or the part thereof, as the case may be, which has thus been transferred.  A successor in interest to whom employment experience or a part thereof is transferred pursuant to this subsection shall, as of the date of the transfer of the organization, trade, assets or business, or part thereof, immediately become an employer if not theretofore an employer subject to this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.). (D)  If an employer transfers in whole or in part his or its organization, trade, assets or business to a successor in interest, whether by merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, descent or otherwise and both the employer and successor in interest are at the time of the transfer under common ownership, management or control, then the employment experience attributable to the transferred business shall also be transferred to and combined with the employment experience of the successor in interest.  The transfer of the employment experience is mandatory and not subject to appeal or protest. (E)  The transfer of part of an employer's employment experience to a successor in interest shall become effective as of the first day of the calendar quarter following the acquisition by the successor in interest.  As of the effective date, the successor in interest shall have its employer rate recalculated by merging its existing employment experience, if any, with the employment experience acquired.  If the successor in interest is not an employer as of the date of acquisition, it shall be assigned the new employer rate until the effective date of the transfer of employment experience. (F)   Upon the transfer in whole or in part of the organization, trade, assets or business to a successor in interest, the employment experience shall not be transferred if the successor in interest is not an employer at the time of the acquisition and the controller finds that the successor in interest acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions. (d)   Contributions of workers to the unemployment compensation fund and the State disability benefits fund. (1)  (A)  For periods after January 1, 1975, each worker shall contribute to the fund 1% of his wages with respect to his employment with an employer, which occurs on and after January 1, 1975, after such employer has satisfied the condition set forth in subsection (h) of R.S.43:21-19 with respect to becoming an employer; provided, however, that such contributions shall be at the rate of 1/2 of 1% of wages paid with respect to employment while the worker is in the employ of the State of New Jersey, or any governmental entity or instrumentality which is an employer as defined under R.S.43:21-19(h)(5), or is covered by an approved private plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" or while the worker is exempt from the provisions of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" under section 7 of that law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-31). (B)  Effective January 1, 1978 there shall be no contributions by workers in the employ of any governmental or nongovernmental employer electing or required to make payments in lieu of contributions unless the employer is covered by the State plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-25 et al.), and in that case contributions shall be at the rate of 1/2 of 1%, except that commencing July 1, 1986, workers in the employ of any nongovernmental employer electing or required to make payments in lieu of contributions shall be required to make contributions to the fund at the same rate prescribed for workers of other nongovernmental employers. (C)  (i) Notwithstanding the above provisions of this paragraph (1), during the period starting July 1, 1986 and ending December 31, 1992, each worker shall contribute to the fund 1.125% of wages paid with respect to his employment with a governmental employer electing or required to pay contributions or nongovernmental employer, including a nonprofit organization which is an employer as defined under R.S.43:21-19(h)(6), regardless of whether that nonprofit organization elects or is required to finance its benefit costs with contributions to the fund or by payments in lieu of contributions, after that employer has satisfied the conditions set forth in subsection R.S.43:21-19(h) with respect to becoming an employer.  Contributions, however, shall be at the rate of 0.625% while the worker is covered by an approved private plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" or while the worker is exempt under section 7 of that law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-31) or any other provision of that law; provided that such contributions shall be at the rate of 0.625% of wages paid with respect to employment with the State of New Jersey or any other governmental entity or instrumentality electing or required to make payments in lieu of contributions and which is covered by the State plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," except that, while the worker is exempt from the provisions of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" under section 7 of that law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-31) or any other provision of that law, or is covered for disability benefits by an approved private plan of the employer, the contributions to the fund shall be 0.125%. (ii)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1995, c.422.) (D)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph (1), during the period starting January 1, 1993 and ending June 30, 1994, each worker shall contribute to the unemployment compensation fund 0.5% of wages paid with respect to the worker's employment with a governmental employer electing or required to pay contributions or nongovernmental employer, including a nonprofit organization which is an employer as defined under paragraph (6) of subsection (h) of R.S.43:21-19, regardless of whether that nonprofit organization elects or is required to finance its benefit costs with contributions to the fund or by payments in lieu of contributions, after that employer has satisfied the conditions set forth in subsection (h) of R.S.43:21-19 with respect to becoming an employer.  No contributions, however, shall be made by the worker while the worker is covered by an approved private plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.) or while the worker is exempt under section 7 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-31) or any other provision of that law; provided that the contributions shall be at the rate of 0.50% of wages paid with respect to employment with the State of New Jersey or any other governmental entity or instrumentality electing or required to make payments in lieu of contributions and which is covered by the State plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," except that, while the worker is exempt from the provisions of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" under section 7 of that law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-31) or any other provision of that law, or is covered for disability benefits by an approved private plan of the employer, no contributions shall be made to the fund. Each worker shall, starting on January 1, 1996 and ending March 31, 1996, contribute to the unemployment compensation fund 0.60% of wages paid with respect to the worker's employment with a governmental employer electing or required to pay contributions or nongovernmental employer, including a nonprofit organization which is an employer as defined under paragraph (6) of subsection (h) of R.S.43:21-19, regardless of whether that nonprofit organization elects or is required to finance its benefit costs with contributions to the fund or by payments in lieu of contributions, after that employer has satisfied the conditions set forth in subsection (h) of R.S.43:21-19 with respect to becoming an employer, provided that the contributions shall be at the rate of 0.10% of wages paid with respect to employment with the State of New Jersey or any other governmental entity or instrumentality electing or required to make payments in lieu of contributions.

(E)  Each employer shall, notwithstanding any provision of law in this State to the contrary, withhold in trust the amount of his workers' contributions from their wages at the time such wages are paid, shall show such deduction on his payroll records, shall furnish such evidence thereof to his workers as the division or controller may prescribe, and shall transmit all such contributions, in addition to his own contributions, to the office of the controller in such manner and at such times as may be prescribed.  If any employer fails to deduct the contributions of any of his workers at the time their wages are paid, or fails to make a deduction therefor at the time wages are paid for the next succeeding payroll period, he alone shall thereafter be liable for such contributions, and for the purpose of R.S.43:21-14, such contributions shall be treated as employer's contributions required from him.

(3)  (A)  If an employee receives wages from more than one employer during any calendar year, and either the sum of his contributions deposited in and credited to the State disability benefits fund plus the amount of his contributions, if any, required towards the costs of benefits under one or more approved private plans under the provisions of section 9 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-33) and deducted from his wages, or the sum of such latter contributions, if the employee is covered during such calendar year only by two or more private plans, exceeds an amount equal to 1/2 of 1% of the "wages" determined in accordance with the provisions of R.S.43:21-7(b)(3) during the calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 1976 or, during calendar year 2012 or any subsequent calendar year, the total amount of his contributions for the year exceeds the amount set by the annual rate of contribution determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection (d), the employee shall be entitled to a refund of the excess if he makes a claim to the controller within two years after the end of the calendar year in which the wages are received with respect to which the refund is claimed and establishes his right to such refund. Such refund shall be made by the controller from the State disability benefits fund. No interest shall be allowed or paid with respect to any such refund. The controller shall, in accordance with prescribed regulations, determine the portion of the aggregate amount of such refunds made during any calendar year which is applicable to private plans for which deductions were made under section 9 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-33) such determination to be based upon the ratio of the amount of such wages exempt from contributions to such fund, as provided in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to coverage under private plans, to the total wages so exempt plus the amount of such wages subject to contributions to the disability benefits fund, as provided in subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of this subsection. The controller shall, in accordance with prescribed regulations, prorate the amount so determined among the applicable private plans in the proportion that the wages covered by each plan bear to the total private plan wages involved in such refunds, and shall assess against and recover from the employer, or the insurer if the insurer has indemnified the employer with respect thereto, the amount so prorated. The provisions of R.S.43:21-14 with respect to collection of employer contributions shall apply to such assessments. The amount so recovered by the controller shall be paid into the State disability benefits fund. (B)  If an employee receives wages from more than one employer during any calendar year, and the sum of his contributions deposited in the "Family Temporary Disability Leave Account" of the State disability benefits fund plus the amount of his contributions, if any, required towards the costs of family temporary disability leave benefits under one or more approved private plans under the provisions of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-25 et al.) and deducted from his wages, exceeds an amount equal to, during calendar year 2009, 0.09% of the "wages" determined in accordance with the provisions of R.S.43:21-7(b)(3), or during calendar year 2010, 0.12% of those wages, or, during calendar year 2011 or any subsequent calendar year, the percentage of those wages set by the annual rate of contribution determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection (d), the employee shall be entitled to a refund of the excess if he makes a claim to the controller within two years after the end of the calendar year in which the wages are received with respect to which the refund is claimed and establishes his right to the refund. The refund shall be made by the controller from the "Family Temporary Disability Leave Account" of the State disability benefits fund. No interest shall be allowed or paid with respect to any such refund. The controller shall, in accordance with prescribed regulations, determine the portion of the aggregate amount of the refunds made during any calendar year which is applicable to private plans for which deductions were made under section 9 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-33), with that determination based upon the ratio of the amount of such wages exempt from contributions to the fund, as provided in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection (d) with respect to coverage under private plans, to the total wages so exempt plus the amount of such wages subject to contributions to the "Family Temporary Disability Leave Account" of the State disability benefits fund, as provided in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection (d). The controller shall, in accordance with prescribed regulations, prorate the amount so determined among the applicable private plans in the proportion that the wages covered by each plan bear to the total private plan wages involved in such refunds, and shall assess against and recover from the employer, or the insurer if the insurer has indemnified the employer with respect thereto, the prorated amount. The provisions of R.S.43:21-14 with respect to collection of employer contributions shall apply to such assessments. The amount so recovered by the controller shall be paid into the "Family Temporary Disability Leave Account" of the State disability benefits fund. (4)   If an individual does not receive any wages from the employing unit which for the purposes of this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.) is treated as his employer, or receives his wages from some other employing unit, such employer shall nevertheless be liable for such individual's contributions in the first instance; and after payment thereof such employer may deduct the amount of such contributions from any sums payable by him to such employing unit, or may recover the amount of such contributions from such employing unit, or, in the absence of such an employing unit, from such individual, in a civil action; provided proceedings therefor are instituted within three months after the date on which such contributions are payable. General rules shall be prescribed whereby such an employing unit may recover the amount of such contributions from such individuals in the same manner as if it were the employer. (5)   Every employer who has elected to become an employer subject to this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), or to cease to be an employer subject to this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), pursuant to the provisions of R.S.43:21-8, shall post and maintain printed notices of such election on his premises, of such design, in such numbers, and at such places as the director may determine to be necessary to give notice thereof to persons in his service. (6)   Contributions by workers, payable to the controller as herein provided, shall be exempt from garnishment, attachment, execution, or any other remedy for the collection of debts. (e)   Contributions by employers to the State disability benefits fund. (1)   Except as hereinafter provided, each employer shall, in addition to the contributions required by subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, contribute 1/2 of 1% of the wages paid by such employer to workers with respect to employment unless he is not a covered employer as defined in subsection (a) of section 3 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-27 (a)), except that the rate for the State of New Jersey shall be 1/10 of 1% for the calendar year 1980 and for the first six months of 1981. Prior to July 1, 1981 and prior to July 1 each year thereafter, the controller shall review the experience accumulated in the account of the State of New Jersey and establish a rate for the next following fiscal year which, in combination with worker contributions, will produce sufficient revenue to keep the account in balance; except that the rate so established shall not be less than 1/10 of 1%. Such contributions shall become due and be paid by the employer to the controller for the State disability benefits fund as established by law, in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed, and shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in his employ. In the payment of any contributions, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to $0.005 or more, in which case it shall be increased to $0.01. (2)   During the continuance of coverage of a worker by an approved private plan of disability benefits under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," the employer shall be exempt from the contributions required by paragraph (1) above with respect to wages paid to such worker. (3)  (A)  The rates of contribution as specified in paragraph (1) above shall be subject to modification as provided herein with respect to employer contributions due on and after July 1, 1951. (B)  A separate disability benefits account shall be maintained for each employer required to contribute to the State disability benefits fund and such account shall be credited with contributions deposited in and credited to such fund with respect to employment occurring on and after January 1, 1949. Each employer's account shall be credited with all contributions paid on or before January 31 of any calendar year on his own behalf and on behalf of individuals in his service with respect to employment occurring in preceding calendar years; provided, however, that if January 31 of any calendar year falls on a Saturday or Sunday an employer's account shall be credited as of January 31 of such calendar year with all the contributions which he has paid on or before the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday or Sunday. But nothing in this act shall be construed to grant any employer or individuals in his service prior claims or rights to the amounts paid by him to the fund either on his own behalf or on behalf of such individuals. Benefits paid to any covered individual in accordance with Article III of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" on or before December 31 of any calendar year with respect to disability in such calendar year and in preceding calendar years shall be charged against the account of the employer by whom such individual was employed at the commencement of such disability or by whom he was last employed, if out of employment. (C)  The controller may prescribe regulations for the establishment, maintenance, and dissolution of joint accounts by two or more employers, and shall, in accordance with such regulations and upon application by two or more employers to establish such an account, or to merge their several individual accounts in a joint account, maintain such joint account as if it constituted a single employer's account. (D)  Prior to July 1 of each calendar year, the controller shall make a preliminary determination of the rate of contribution for the 12 months commencing on such July 1 for each employer subject to the contribution requirements of this subsection (e). (1)   Such preliminary rate shall be 1/2 of 1% unless on the preceding January 31 of such year such employer shall have been a covered employer who has paid contributions to the State disability benefits fund with respect to employment in the three calendar years immediately preceding such year. (2)   If the minimum requirements in subparagraph (D) (1) above have been fulfilled and the credited contributions exceed the benefits charged by more than $500.00, such preliminary rate shall be as follows: (i)    2/10 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 exceeds 1% but is less than 1 1/4% of his average annual payroll as defined in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.); (ii)   15/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 1 1/4% but is less than 1 1/2% of his average annual payroll; (iii) 1/10 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 1 1/2% of his average annual payroll. (3)   If the minimum requirements in subparagraph (D) (1) above have been fulfilled and the contributions credited exceed the benefits charged but by not more than $500.00 plus 1% of his average annual payroll, or if the benefits charged exceed the contributions credited but by not more than $500.00, the preliminary rate shall be 1/4 of 1%. (4)   If the minimum requirements in subparagraph (D) (1) above have been fulfilled and the benefits charged exceed the contributions credited by more than $500.00, such preliminary rate shall be as follows: (i)    35/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 is less than 1/4 of 1% of his average annual payroll; (ii)   45/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 1/4 of 1% but is less than 1/2 of 1% of his average annual payroll; (iii) 55/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 1/2 of 1% but is less than 3/4 of 1% of his average annual payroll; (iv) 65/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 3/4 of 1% but is less than 1% of his average annual payroll; (v)   75/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 1% of his average annual payroll. (5)   Determination of the preliminary rate as specified in subparagraphs (D)(2), (3) and (4) above shall be subject, however, to the condition that it shall in no event be decreased by more than 1/10 of 1% of wages or increased by more than 2/10 of 1% of wages from the preliminary rate determined for the preceding year in accordance with subparagraph (D) (1), (2), (3) or (4), whichever shall have been applicable. (E)  (1)  Prior to July 1 of each calendar year the controller shall determine the amount of the State disability benefits fund as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year, increased by the contributions paid thereto during January of the current calendar year with respect to employment occurring in the preceding calendar year. If such amount exceeds the net amount withdrawn from the unemployment trust fund pursuant to section 23 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-47) plus the amount at the end of such preceding calendar year of the unemployment disability account as defined in section 22 of said law (C.43:21-46), such excess shall be expressed as a percentage of the wages on which contributions were paid to the State disability benefits fund on or before January 31 with respect to employment in the preceding calendar year. (2)   The controller shall then make a final determination of the rates of contribution for the 12 months commencing July 1 of such year for employers whose preliminary rates are determined as provided in subparagraph (D) hereof, as follows: (i)    If the percentage determined in accordance with subparagraph (E)(1) of this paragraph equals or exceeds 1 1/4%, the final employer rates shall be the preliminary rates determined as provided in subparagraph (D) hereof, except that if the employer's preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(2) or subparagraph (D)(3) hereof, the final employer rate shall be the preliminary employer rate decreased by such percentage of excess taken to the nearest 5/100 of 1%, but in no case shall such final rate be less than 1/10 of 1%. (ii)   If the percentage determined in accordance with subparagraph (E)(1) of this paragraph equals or exceeds 3/4 of 1% and is less than 1 1/4 of 1%, the final employer rates shall be the preliminary employer rates. (iii) If the percentage determined in accordance with subparagraph (E)(1) of this paragraph is less than 3/4 of 1%, but in excess of 1/4 of 1%, the final employer rates shall be the preliminary employer rates determined as provided in subparagraph (D) hereof increased by the difference between 3/4 of 1% and such percentage taken to the nearest 5/100 of 1%; provided, however, that no such final rate shall be more than 1/4 of 1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(2) hereof, more than 1/2 of 1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(1) and subparagraph (D)(3) hereof, nor more than 3/4 of 1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(4) hereof. (iv)  If the amount of the State disability benefits fund determined as provided in subparagraph (E)(1) of this paragraph is equal to or less than 1/4 of 1%, then the final rate shall be 2/5 of 1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(2) hereof, 7/10 of 1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(1) and subparagraph (D)(3) hereof, and 1.1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(4) hereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any determination made by the controller with respect to any 12-month period commencing on July 1, 1970, the final rates for all employers for the period beginning January 1, 1971, shall be as set forth herein.

(cf: P.L.2020, c.23, s.6) 6.    Section 16 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-40) is amended to read as follows: 16.  a.  For periods of disability commencing on or after October 1, 1984, an individual's weekly benefit rate shall be two-thirds of his average weekly wage, subject to a maximum of 53% of the Statewide average weekly remuneration paid to workers by employers, as determined under subsection (c) of R.S.43:21-3, except as provided in subsection b. of this section. b.  (1)  For periods of disability commencing on or after July 1, 2020, and for periods of family temporary disability leave commencing on or after July 1, 2020 and before June 30, 2026, an individual's weekly benefit rate shall be 85% of the individual's average weekly wage, subject to a maximum of 70% of the Statewide average weekly remuneration paid to workers by employers. (2)   For periods of family temporary disability leave commencing on or after July 1, 2026, an individual's basic weekly benefit rate shall be 100% of the individual's average weekly wage, subject to a maximum of 100% of the Statewide average weekly remuneration paid to workers by employers. (3)   In the case of a period of family temporary disability leave commencing on or after July 1, 2026 taken following the birth or placement of a child as specified by the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection o. of section 3 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27), the individual may elect to take benefits for a period of longer than the 12 weeks otherwise provided by paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of section 15 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-39), but the weekly benefit amount shall be a reduced amount which shall be calculated by multiplying by 12 the individuals basic weekly benefit rate determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection b. and dividing that total amount by the total number of weeks, but not more than 24 weeks, in which the individual elects to take the benefits.  The division, upon making the determination of the basic weekly benefit rate pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection b., shall inform the individual of that determination and the option for the individual to choose a number of weeks of benefits from 13 to 24 weeks and inform the individual what the individuals weekly benefit rate would be for each number of weeks the individual may elect to take pursuant to this paragraph (3). c.     Each individual's benefit rate shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1.00 if not already a multiple thereof.  The amount of benefits for each day of disability for which benefits are payable shall be one-seventh of the corresponding weekly benefit amount; provided that the total benefits for a fractional part of a week shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1.00 if not already a multiple thereof. d.    For any week beginning on or after the effective date of P.L.2019, c.126, with respect to a period of disability of an individual who is otherwise eligible for benefits but only able to return to work on a reduced basis while recovering from the disability, the individual, if permitted by the employer to return to work on the reduced basis, shall be paid an amount of benefits with respect to that week such that the sum of the wages and those benefits paid to the individual, rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.00, will equal the weekly benefit amount the individual would have been paid if totally unable to perform the duties of employment due to disability, provided that: (1)   The individual must have been totally unable to perform the duties of employment due to disability and receiving full benefits for at least seven consecutive days prior to claiming partial benefits under this subsection; (2)   The maximum duration of partial benefits paid pursuant to this subsection is eight weeks, unless the division, after a review of medical documentation from a qualified healthcare provider, approves in writing an extension beyond eight weeks, but in no case shall the duration be extended to more than 12 weeks; and (3)   If the individual is able to return to work on a reduced basis but the employer is unable or otherwise chooses not to permit the individual to do so, the individual will continue to be eligible for benefits until the individual is fully recovered from the disability and able to perform the duties of employment, but nothing in this subsection shall be construed as increasing the total number of weeks of disability benefits for which the individual is eligible. For the purposes of this section, "qualified healthcare provider" means a legally licensed physician, dentist, podiatrist, chiropractor, certified nurse midwife, advanced practice nurse or public health nurse designated by the division. (cf: P.L.2019, c.126, s.2) 7.    Section 21 of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2) is amended to read as follows: 21. a.  The division shall implement disability insurance [goals] requirements for the timely determination and prompt payment of temporary disability benefits and family temporary disability benefits under the State plan, as follows: (1)   for temporary disability benefits, in each calendar year: (a)   not less than 40 percent of the original benefit determinations shall be completed within seven days after the commencement of the disability, or the receipt of the benefit claims by the division, whichever is later;

(2)   the number and percentage of claims received with insufficient information, what portion of those claims were because of failure of claimants to provide sufficient information, what portion of those claims were because of failures of medical providers of claimants to provide sufficient information, and what portion of those claims were because of failures of employers to provide sufficient information; (3)   the number and percentage of claims for which determinations were delayed because of employer failure to make the notifications or disclosures to employees and the division within the amount of time required by subsection (a) of section 25 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-49) or subsection f. or g. of section 10 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1), the number of complaints received related to employer noncompliance with those requirements, and the number of employers which have been, because of the failures, required, pursuant to section 31 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-55), to pay fines or penalties to the division or added amounts to claimants, the total amount of payments to the division, and the total amount of payments to claimants;

and (5)   if any of the [disability insurance goals set pursuant to] requirements of this section for the timely determination and prompt payment of temporary disability benefits and family temporary disability benefits were not [attained] met during the year, or it is determined that there are other significant problems in the administration of the disability insurance system, the report shall provide an evaluation of the causes of the deficiencies and a plan to correct them and that plan shall include: (a)   any increase in personnel needed to process claims and make benefit payments [expeditiously and] accurately and as expeditiously as is required by subsection a. of this section; (b)   any measures needed to enforce notification and reporting requirements; (c)   any measures needed to inform employers and employees of their responsibilities to facilitate the timely provision of benefits;

(cf: P.L.2019, c.37, s.21) 8. (New section)    a. The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, in collaboration with the Department of Health, shall prepare a survey to be provided to individuals who have taken continuous child bonding leave pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection o. of section 3 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27), within one year of birth or placement of the child for which leave was taken. Participation by individuals in the survey shall be optional.  The survey shall include, but not be limited to, questions regarding: (1)   demographic information including age, sex, educational attainment, and ethnicity; (2)   duration of leave requested, and the duration of leave taken and amount of benefits; (3)   employment status including full or part-time employment and if the individual has more than one employer; (4)   breastfeeding duration, including incidence of exclusive breastfeeding at three and six months after birth; (5)   healthcare provider visits for well-baby, maternity care, and re-hospitalizations; and (6)   parental physical and emotional well-being, including symptoms of depression. b.    Data from this survey shall be anonymized and made publically available through the Department of Health, in a similar manner to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). 9.   This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases the basic family leave insurance (FLI) weekly benefit payments to 100 percent of a workers average weekly wage up to 100 percent of the Statewide average weekly wage. The bill increases, from 12 to 24 consecutive weeks, the maximum duration of family leave time that can be claimed for bonding with newborn or newly adopted children.  The bill provides that in a case of an eligible individual electing to take more than the current maximum of 12 weeks of benefits, the department will determine a reduced weekly benefit rate for the weeks after the first 12 weeks by multiplying by 12 the individuals basic weekly benefit and dividing the resulting total amount by the total number of weeks of benefits that the individual elects to take (including the first 12 weeks of benefits), thus preventing any increase in the total amount of benefits paid. The bill provides that the rights provided by the Family Leave Act for leave takers to be reinstated after taking family leave would be extended beyond the usual maximum of 12 weeks in the case of an individual who elects, pursuant to the bill, to take additional leave for child bonding. The bill offsets the cost of increasing FLI basic benefit rates and permits a reduction of the FLI and temporary disability insurance (TDI) tax rates by making sufficient adjustments to the portion of total wages which are subject to workers contributions to the State TDI fund and the FLI account of that fund. The bill provides that worker tax rates for TDI and FLI be determined on the basis of estimates of anticipated costs of benefits and administration without reference to amounts paid in previous years.  The Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DOLWD) is required, before finalizing the tax rates, to report its proposed tax rates to the Joint Budget Oversight Committee (JBOC), which is required to review the proposed rates for compliance with the law and approve or disapprove them within 20 business days, and, if disapproved, provide alternative rates. The DOLWD is required to finalize rates upon approval by the JBOC, finalize alternative rates provided by the JBOC, or finalize the proposed rates at the end of the 20-day period if the JBOC takes no action.  The bill designates the laws claims processing standards to be requirements, not goals, and requires that the report submitted to the JBOC on proposed tax rates include a plan to correct failures to meet the standards and that the proposed tax rates are sufficient to implement the plan. The DOLWD is directed to develop a survey in collaboration with the Department of Health to collect information on those taking continuous child bonding leave to gather data on various metrics including physical and emotional well-being and breastfeeding duration.  The bill requires that anonymized survey data be made public by the Department of Health. Comprehensive paid parental leave is crucial for the well-being of children and families.  There is much evidence that increasing to 24 weeks the maximum duration of leave for bonding with newborn or newly-adopted children will assist in improving breastfeeding rates, maternal and infant health metrics including postpartum depression symptoms, and long-term participation of women in the workforce.  Raising the reimbursement rate for family leave underscores the social value of caregiving and may help address socio-economic gender disparities.

A5208 ASSEMBLY, No. 5208 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JANUARY 16, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  NANCY F. MUÑOZ District 21 (Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union) SYNOPSIS Comprehensive Reimbursement and Duration of Leave Expansion Act; increases family leave insurance benefits and leave duration for child bonding. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning family temporary disability leave, amending parts of the statutory law, and supplementing P.L.1948, c.110. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. (New section) This act shall be known and may be cited as the Comprehensive Reimbursement and Duration of Leave Expansion Act or CRADLE Act. 2. (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.    New Jersey recognizes that comprehensive parental leave policies are crucial for the well-being of children and families. The average length of parental leave in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries is 33 weeks, with most countries offering between 26 and 52 weeks of leave. New Jersey has been a leader in paid family leave insurance, but further expansion is necessary to ensure the State keeps pace with evolving family needs and scientific recommendations. b.    Extensions of paid maternity leave have been associated with improvements in a variety of metrics including: (1)   Postpartum depression.  In Hong Kong, a nationally mandated four-week extension of maternity leave was associated with a 22 percent decrease in the number of mothers experiencing postnatal depression symptoms. (2)   Infant mortality rates.  Multiple studies have found that a 10-week extension of maternity leave is associated with a significant decrease in infant mortality rates, upwards of three percent in OECD countries. (3)   Socioeconomic and health outcomes.  Globally, an increase of 10 weeks of maternity leave at full pay was associated with a 10 percent decrease in neonatal and infant mortality. (4) Female participation in the workforce.  Domestically, Google lowered attrition rates by over 50 percent for postpartum employees by increasing their paid parental leave from three to five months and offering full-pay wage replacement.  A multi-country analysis spanning two decades found that an increase in the duration of paid leave, from an average of 10 weeks to 33 weeks, was associated with an increase in the female employment ratio by over two percent. (5) Breastfeeding duration.  In Chile, a national extension of maternity leave from 12 to 24 weeks increased rates of exclusive breastfeeding at six months of age by 43 percent. c.    The World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends six months of exclusive breastfeeding for newborns optimal development and health.  Breastfeeding can improve infant immunity and lower the risks of diseases including respiratory infections, asthma, and diabetes.  There is a strong and well-studied correlation between women returning to work and breastfeeding cessation.  Women receiving at least 12 weeks of leave were more likely to initiate and maintain breastfeeding for at least six months. This is particularly pronounced in low-income women who have the lowest rates of exclusive breastfeeding at six months in the United States. d.    Postpartum depression affects at least 16,000 women in New Jersey each year.  Untreated postpartum depression can cause intense feelings of sadness, anxiety, and poor infant-mother bonding, which can, in its most serious forms, progress into self-harm, suicidal, or filicidal ideations or actions. While there are many biological factors that affect postpartum depression risk including hormone levels and a family history of depression, sociocultural factors such as financial stress, domestic violence, and poor societal support have also been associated with heightened risk for postpartum depression.  There is a wealth of empirical data that maternity leave times, especially those over 12 weeks in length, are associated with decreased rates of postpartum depression symptoms. e.    Paid parental leave allows families to care for their infants at home for longer, increasing the likelihood of accessing necessary healthcare and avoiding the increased risk of illness associated with attending childcare.  Implementation of New Yorks paid family leave policy was associated with an 18 percent decrease in doctors visits for respiratory infections in young infants.  Infants of mothers returning to work within 12 weeks of birth experience a decrease in the likelihood of attending a well-baby visit, and in receiving timely immunizations.  These effects on wellbeing may last beyond infancy, with children of mothers that returned to work within 12 weeks of birth showing an increased incidence of behavioral problems in early childhood. f.     In 2023, the 75th percentile for full-time infant care in New Jersey was $1,750, which was 13 percent higher than the Statewide average weekly wage.  Aside from savings in childcare costs, paid parental leave stabilizes womens employment status and income.  It is reported that women who took paid maternity leave were up to 40 percent less likely to receive public assistance in the year following childbirth, even when controlling for variables such as wage, education attainment, and age.  Paid parental leave may also have long-lasting benefits, especially for women.  Poverty in old age is heavily skewed towards women, due to longer lifespans, lower workforce participation, lower wages, and lower pensions or retirement contributions compared to men.  Enabling women to stay in paid work may help mitigate the high levels of old age poverty for women in the future. g.    High rates of reimbursement reaffirm that care work is socially valued.  Unpaid care work largely falls on women and reinforces socioeconomic disadvantages.  In New Jersey, women made up about 70 percent of all individuals who took caregiving leave in 2022.  A review of global family leave policies notes that: When leave policies replace only a small share of income, the lower earner in a household  disproportionately women due to persisting gender wage gaps  will be more likely to take it. Moreover, low wage replacement rates exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities since workers with lower incomes and fewer assets will be less able to afford a reduction in pay. 3.  Section 4 of P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-4) is amended to read as follows: 4.    An employee of an employer in this State subject to the provisions of [this act] P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) shall be entitled to a family leave of 12 weeks, or the number of weeks for which the employee elects to take benefits pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 16 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-40), in any 24-month period upon advance notice to the employer in the manner specified by the provisions of sections 11 and 12 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.2 and 43:21-39.3), unless the employer denies family leave to the employee pursuant to subsection h. of this section. a.     In the case of a family member who has a serious health condition, the leave may be taken intermittently when medically necessary, in the manner specified by the provisions of section 11 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.2). b.    In the case of the foster care placement, birth or adoption of a healthy child, the leave may be taken intermittently in the manner specified by the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 12 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.3). c.     Leave taken because of the birth or placement for adoption of a child may commence at any time within a year after the date of the foster care placement, birth or placement for adoption. d.    Family leave required by [this act] P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) may be paid, unpaid, or a combination of paid and unpaid leave.  If an employer provides paid family leave for fewer than 12 workweeks, the additional weeks of leave added to attain the 12-workweek total required by [this act] P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) may be unpaid. e.     An employer may require that any period of family leave be supported by certification issued by a duly licensed health care provider or any other health care provider determined by the director to be capable of providing adequate certification as described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, or where the leave is for an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to a communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of a communicable disease, certification issued by a school, place of care for children, public health authority, public official, or health care provider, as described in paragraph (3) of this subsection. (1)   Where the certification is for the serious health condition of a family member of the employee, the certification shall be sufficient if it states: (a) the date on which the serious health condition commenced; (b) the probable duration of the condition; and (c) the medical facts within the provider's knowledge regarding the condition; (2)   Where the certification is for the birth or placement of the child, the certification need only state the date of birth or date of placement, whichever is appropriate; (3)   Where the certification is for an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of the communicable disease, the certification shall be sufficient if it includes: (a)   for leave taken to provide in-home care or treatment of a child due to the closure of the school or place of care of the child of the employee, by order of a public official due to the epidemic or other public health emergency, the date on which the closure of the school or place of care of the child of the employee commenced and the reason for such closure; (b)   for leave taken due to a public health authority's issuance of a determination requiring or imposing responsive or prophylactic measures as a result of illness caused by an epidemic of a communicable disease or known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease because the presence in the community of a family member in need of care by the employee would jeopardize the health of others, the date of issuance of the determination and the probable duration of the determination; or (c)   for leave taken because a health care provider or public health authority recommends that a family member in need of care by the employee voluntarily undergo self-quarantine as a result of suspected exposure to a communicable disease because the presence in the community of that family member in need of care by the employee would jeopardize the health of others, the date of the recommendation, the probable duration of the condition, and the medical or other facts within the health care provider or public health authority's knowledge regarding the condition. In any case in which the employer has reason to doubt the validity of the certification provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the employer may require, at its own expense, that an employee obtain an opinion regarding the serious health condition from a second health care provider designated or approved, but not employed on a regular basis, by the employer. If the second opinion differs from the certification provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the employer may require, at its own expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider designated or approved jointly by the employer and the employee concerning the serious health condition.  The opinion of the third health care provider shall be considered to be final and shall be binding on the employer and the employee. f.     In any case in which the necessity for leave under [this act] P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) is foreseeable, based upon placement of a child into foster care an expected birth or placement of the child for adoption, the employee shall provide the employer with prior notice of the expected birth or placement of the child for adoption or foster care in the manner specified by the provisions of section 11 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.2). g.    No employee shall, during any period of leave taken pursuant to this section, perform services on a full-time basis for any person for whom the employee did not provide those services immediately prior to commencement of the leave. h.    An employer may deny family leave to the employee if: (1)   The employee is a salaried employee who is among the highest paid five% of the employer's employees or the seven highest paid employees of the employer, whichever is greater; (2)   The denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the employer's operations; and (3)   The employer notifies the employee of its intent to deny the leave at the time the employer determines that the denial is necessary. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply when, in the event of a state of emergency declared by the Governor or when indicated to be needed by the Commissioner of Health or other public health authority, the family leave is for an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to a communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of a communicable disease. i.     In any case in which the leave has already commenced at the time of the notification pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection h. of this section, the employee shall return to work within 10 working days of the date of notification. j.     In the case of leave taken due to an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of the communicable disease, the leave may be taken intermittently if: (1) the covered individual provides the employer with prior notice of the leave as soon as practicable; and (2) the covered individual makes a reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the operations of the employer and, if possible, provide the employer, prior to the commencement of the intermittent leave, with a regular schedule of the day or days of the week on which the intermittent leave will be taken. (cf: P.L.2020, c.23, s.2) 4.    R.S.43:21-7 is amended to read as follows: 43:21-7.  Employers other than governmental entities, whose benefit financing provisions are set forth in section 4 of P.L.1971, c.346 (C.43:21-7.3), and those nonprofit organizations liable for payment in lieu of contributions on the basis set forth in section 3 of P.L.1971, c.346 (C.43:21-7.2), shall pay to the controller for the unemployment compensation fund, contributions as set forth in subsections (a), (b) and (c) hereof, and the provisions of subsections (d) and (e) shall be applicable to all employers, consistent with the provisions of the "unemployment compensation law" and the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.). (a)   Payment. (1)   Contributions shall accrue and become payable by each employer for each calendar year in which he is subject to this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), with respect to having individuals in his employ during that calendar year, at the rates and on the basis hereinafter set forth. Such contributions shall become due and be paid by each employer to the controller for the fund, in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed, and shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in his employ. (2)   In the payment of any contributions, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to $0.005 or more, in which case it shall be increased to $0.01. (b)   Rate of contributions. Each employer shall pay the following contributions: (1)   For the calendar year 1947, and each calendar year thereafter, 2 7/10% of wages paid by him during each such calendar year, except as otherwise prescribed by subsection (c) of this section. (2)   The "wages" of any individual, with respect to any one employer, as the term is used in this subsection (b) and in subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section 7, shall include the first $4,800.00 paid during calendar year 1975, for services performed either within or without this State; provided that no contribution shall be required by this State with respect to services performed in another state if such other state imposes contribution liability with respect thereto.  If an employer (hereinafter referred to as a successor employer) during any calendar year acquires substantially all the property used in a trade or business of another employer (hereinafter referred to as a predecessor), or used in a separate unit of a trade or business of a predecessor, and immediately after the acquisition employs in his trade or business an individual who immediately prior to the acquisition was employed in the trade or business of such predecessors, then, for the purpose of determining whether the successor employer has paid wages with respect to employment equal to the first $4,800.00 paid during calendar year 1975, any wages paid to such individual by such predecessor during such calendar year and prior to such acquisition shall be considered as having been paid by such successor employer. (3)   For calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 1976, the "wages" of any individual, as defined in the preceding paragraph (2) of this subsection (b), shall be established and promulgated by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development on or before September 1 of the preceding year and, except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection (b), shall be, 28 times the Statewide average weekly remuneration paid to workers by employers, as determined under R.S.43:21-3(c), raised to the next higher multiple of $100.00 if not already a multiple thereof, provided that if the amount of wages so determined for a calendar year is less than the amount similarly determined for the preceding year, the greater amount will be used; provided, further, that if the amount of such wages so determined does not equal or exceed the amount of wages as defined in subsection (b) of section 3306 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.3306(b)), the wages as determined in this paragraph in any calendar year shall be raised to equal the amount established under the "Federal Unemployment Tax Act," chapter 23 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.3301 et seq.), for that calendar year. (4)   For calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2020, the "wages" of any individual, as defined in the preceding paragraph (2) of this subsection (b) for purposes of contributions of workers to the State disability benefits fund, including the "Family Temporary Disability Leave Account" pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, shall be established and promulgated by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development on or before September 1 of the preceding year and shall be 107 times the Statewide average weekly remuneration paid to workers by employers, as determined under R.S.43:21-3(c), raised to the next higher multiple of $100.00 if not already a multiple thereof, provided that if the amount of wages so determined for a calendar year is less than the amount similarly determined for the preceding year, the greater amount will be used, except that the limit of 107 times the Statewide average weekly remuneration shall not apply during any year commencing on or after January 1, 2026, and any wages then exceeding that limit shall be regarded as wages in the same manner as wages not exceeding that limit for the purposes of determining the amount of wages subject to contributions. (c)   Future rates based on benefit experience. (1)   A separate account for each employer shall be maintained and this shall be credited with all the contributions which he has paid on his own behalf on or before January 31 of any calendar year with respect to employment occurring in the preceding calendar year; provided, however, that if January 31 of any calendar year falls on a Saturday or Sunday, an employer's account shall be credited as of January 31 of such calendar year with all the contributions which he has paid on or before the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday or Sunday. But nothing in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.) shall be construed to grant any employer or individuals in his service prior claims or rights to the amounts paid by him into the fund either on his own behalf or on behalf of such individuals. Benefits paid with respect to benefit years commencing on and after January 1, 1953, to any individual on or before December 31 of any calendar year with respect to unemployment in such calendar year and in preceding calendar years shall be charged against the account or accounts of the employer or employers in whose employment such individual established base weeks constituting the basis of such benefits, except that, with respect to benefit years commencing after January 4, 1998, an employer's account shall not be charged for benefits paid to a claimant if: (1) the claimant's employment by that employer was ended in any way which, pursuant to subsection (a), (b), (c), (f), (g) or (h) of R.S.43:21-5, would have disqualified the claimant for benefits if the claimant had applied for benefits at the time when that employment ended, or (2) the claimants employment by that employer continued and the claimant continued to both perform work for and receive remuneration from that employer, during the claimants period of unemployment.  Benefits paid under a given benefit determination shall be charged against the account of the employer to whom such determination relates.  When each benefit payment is made, notification shall be promptly provided to each employer included in the unemployment insurance monetary calculation of benefits.  Such notification shall identify the employer against whose account the amount of such payment is being charged, shall show at least the name and social security account number of the claimant and shall specify the period of unemployment to which said benefit payment applies. An annual summary statement of unemployment benefits charged to the employer's account shall be provided. (2)   Regulations may be prescribed for the establishment, maintenance, and dissolution of joint accounts by two or more employers, and shall, in accordance with such regulations and upon application by two or more employers to establish such an account, or to merge their several individual accounts in a joint account, maintain such joint account as if it constituted a single employer's account. (3)   No employer's rate shall be lower than 5.4% unless assignment of such lower rate is consistent with the conditions applicable to additional credit allowance for such year under section 3303(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.3303(a)(1)), any other provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding. (4)   Employer Reserve Ratio. (A)  Each employer's rate shall be 2 8/10%, except as otherwise provided in the following provisions.  No employer's rate for the 12 months commencing July 1 of any calendar year shall be other than 2 8/10%, unless as of the preceding January 31 such employer shall have paid contributions with respect to wages paid in each of the three calendar years immediately preceding such year, in which case such employer's rate for the 12 months commencing July 1 of any calendar year shall be determined on the basis of his record up to the beginning of such calendar year. If, at the beginning of such calendar year, the total of all his contributions, paid on his own behalf, for all past years exceeds the total benefits charged to his account for all such years, his contribution rate shall be: (1)   2 5/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 4%, but less than 5%, of his average annual payroll (as defined in paragraph (2), subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-19); (2)   2 2/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 5%, but is less than 6%, of his average annual payroll; (3)   1 9/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 6%, but is less than 7%, of his average annual payroll; (4)   1 6/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 7%, but is less than 8%, of his average annual payroll; (5)   1 3/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 8%, but is less than 9%, of his average annual payroll; (6)   1%, if such excess equals or exceeds 9%, but is less than 10%, of his average annual payroll; (7)   7/10 of 1%, if such excess equals or exceeds 10%, but is less than 11%, of his average annual payroll; (8)   4/10 of 1%, if such excess equals or exceeds 11% of his average annual payroll. (B)  If the total of an employer's contributions, paid on his own behalf, for all past periods for the purposes of this paragraph (4), is less than the total benefits charged against his account during the same period, his rate shall be: (1)   4%, if such excess is less than 10% of his average annual payroll; (2)   4 3/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 10%, but is less than 20%, of his average annual payroll; (3)   4 6/10%, if such excess equals or exceeds 20% of his average annual payroll. (C)  Specially assigned rates. (i)    If no contributions were paid on wages for employment in any calendar year used in determining the average annual payroll of an employer eligible for an assigned rate under this paragraph (4), the employer's rate shall be specially assigned as follows: if the reserve balance in its account is positive, its assigned rate shall be the highest rate in effect for positive balance accounts for that period, or 5.4%, whichever is higher, and if the reserve balance in its account is negative, its assigned rate shall be the highest rate in effect for deficit accounts for that period. (ii)   If, following the purchase of a corporation with little or no activity, known as a corporate shell, the resulting employing unit operates a new or different business activity, the employing unit shall be assigned a new employer rate. (iii) Entities operating under common ownership, management or control, when the operation of the entities is not identifiable, distinguishable and severable, shall be considered a single employer for the purposes of this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.). (D)  The contribution rates prescribed by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (4) shall be increased or decreased in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this subsection (c) for experience rating periods through June 30, 1986. (5)   (A) Unemployment Trust Fund Reserve Ratio. If on March 31 of any calendar year the balance in the unemployment trust fund equals or exceeds 4% but is less than 7% of the total taxable wages reported to the controller as of that date in respect to employment during the preceding calendar year, the contribution rate, effective July 1 following, of each employer eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be increased by 3/10 of 1% over the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection.  If on March 31 of any calendar year the balance of the unemployment trust fund exceeds 2 1/2% but is less than 4% of the total taxable wages reported to the controller as of that date in respect to employment during the preceding calendar year, the contribution rate, effective July 1 following, of each employer eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be increased by 6/10 of 1% over the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraph (3) or (4) of this subsection. If on March 31 of any calendar year the balance of the unemployment trust fund is less than 2 1/2% of the total taxable wages reported to the controller as of that date in respect to employment during the preceding calendar year, the contribution rate, effective July 1 following, of each employer: (1) eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be increased by (i) 6/10 of 1% over the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraph (3), (4)(A) or (4)(B) of this subsection, and (ii) an additional amount equal to 20% of the total rate established herein, provided, however, that the final contribution rate for each employer shall be computed to the nearest multiple of 1/10% if not already a multiple thereof; (2) not eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be increased by 6/10 of 1% over the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection. For the period commencing July 1, 1984 and ending June 30, 1986, the contribution rate for each employer liable to pay contributions under R.S.43:21-7 shall be increased by a factor of 10% computed to the nearest multiple of 1/10% if not already a multiple thereof. (B)  If on March 31 of any calendar year the balance in the unemployment trust fund equals or exceeds 10% but is less than 12 1/2% of the total taxable wages reported to the controller as of that date in respect to employment during the preceding calendar year, the contribution rate, effective July 1 following, of each employer eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be reduced by 3/10 of 1% under the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection; provided that in no event shall the contribution rate of any employer be reduced to less than 4/10 of 1%. If on March 31 of any calendar year the balance in the unemployment trust fund equals or exceeds 12 1/2% of the total taxable wages reported to the controller as of that date in respect to employment during the preceding calendar year, the contribution rate, effective July 1 following, of each employer eligible for a contribution rate calculation based upon benefit experience, shall be reduced by 6/10 of 1% if his account for all past periods reflects an excess of contributions paid over total benefits charged of 3% or more of his average annual payroll, otherwise by 3/10 of 1% under the contribution rate otherwise established under the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection; provided that in no event shall the contribution rate of any employer be reduced to less than 4/10 of 1%. (C)  The "balance" in the unemployment trust fund, as the term is used in subparagraphs (A) and (B) above, shall not include moneys credited to the State's account under section 903 of the Social Security Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. s.1103), during any period in which such moneys are appropriated for the payment of expenses incurred in the administration of the "unemployment compensation law." (D)  Prior to July 1 of each calendar year the controller shall determine the Unemployment Trust Fund Reserve Ratio, which shall be calculated by dividing the balance of the unemployment trust fund as of the prior March 31 by total taxable wages reported to the controller by all employers as of March 31 with respect to their employment during the last calendar year.

(L)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (5) and notwithstanding the actual fund reserve ratio, the contribution rate for employers liable to pay contributions, as computed under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (5), shall be, for fiscal year 2011, the rates set by column "C" of the table in that subparagraph.

(Q)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph (5) and notwithstanding the actual fund reserve ratio, the contribution rate for employers liable to pay contributions, as computed under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (5), shall be, for fiscal year 2024, the rates set by column "E" of the table in that subparagraph, unless the application of the provisions of this paragraph (5) using the actual fund reserve ratio would result in the contribution rate for employers being set by a column which has lower tax rates than the rates in column "E", in which case the employers shall be liable to pay contributions at the rates set by the column with the lower tax rates. (6)   Additional contributions. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any employer who has been assigned a contribution rate pursuant to subsection (c) of this section for the year commencing July 1, 1948, and for any year commencing July 1 thereafter, may voluntarily make payment of additional contributions, and upon such payment shall receive a recomputation of the experience rate applicable to such employer, including in the calculation the additional contribution so made, except that, following a transfer as described under R.S.43:21-7(c)(7)(D), neither the predecessor nor successor in interest shall be eligible to make a voluntary payment of additional contributions during the year the transfer occurs and the next full calendar year. Any such additional contribution shall be made during the 30-day period following the notification to the employer of his contribution rate as prescribed in this section, unless, for good cause, the time for payment has been extended by the controller for not to exceed an additional 60 days; provided that in no event may such payments which are made later than 120 days after the beginning of the year for which such rates are effective be considered in determining the experience rate for the year in which the payment is made. Any employer receiving any extended period of time within which to make such additional payment and failing to make such payment timely shall be, in addition to the required amount of additional payment, liable for a penalty of 5% thereof or $5.00, whichever is greater, not to exceed $50.00. Any adjustment under this subsection shall be made only in the form of credits against accrued or future contributions. (7)   Transfers. (A)  Upon the transfer of the organization, trade or business, or substantially all the assets of an employer to a successor in interest, whether by merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, descent or otherwise, the controller shall transfer the employment experience of the predecessor employer to the successor in interest, including credit for past years, contributions paid, annual payrolls, benefit charges, et cetera, applicable to such predecessor employer, pursuant to regulation, if it is determined that the employment experience of the predecessor employer with respect to the organization, trade, assets or business which has been transferred may be considered indicative of the future employment experience of the successor in interest.  The successor in interest may, within four months of the date of such transfer of the organization, trade, assets or business, or thereafter upon good cause shown, request a reconsideration of the transfer of employment experience of the predecessor employer.  The request for reconsideration shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the controller, that the employment experience of the predecessor is not indicative of the future employment experience of the successor. (B)  An employer who transfers part of his or its organization, trade, assets or business to a successor in interest, whether by merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, descent or otherwise, may jointly make application with such successor in interest for transfer of that portion of the employment experience of the predecessor employer relating to the portion of the organization, trade, assets or business transferred to the successor in interest, including credit for past years, contributions paid, annual payrolls, benefit charges, et cetera, applicable to such predecessor employer. The transfer of employment experience may be allowed pursuant to regulation only if it is found that the employment experience of the predecessor employer with respect to the portion of the organization, trade, assets or business which has been transferred may be considered indicative of the future employment experience of the successor in interest. Credit shall be given to the successor in interest only for the years during which contributions were paid by the predecessor employer with respect to that part of the organization, trade, assets or business transferred. (C)  A transfer of the employment experience in whole or in part having become final, the predecessor employer thereafter shall not be entitled to consideration for an adjusted rate based upon his or its experience or the part thereof, as the case may be, which has thus been transferred.  A successor in interest to whom employment experience or a part thereof is transferred pursuant to this subsection shall, as of the date of the transfer of the organization, trade, assets or business, or part thereof, immediately become an employer if not theretofore an employer subject to this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.). (D)  If an employer transfers in whole or in part his or its organization, trade, assets or business to a successor in interest, whether by merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, descent or otherwise and both the employer and successor in interest are at the time of the transfer under common ownership, management or control, then the employment experience attributable to the transferred business shall also be transferred to and combined with the employment experience of the successor in interest.  The transfer of the employment experience is mandatory and not subject to appeal or protest. (E)  The transfer of part of an employer's employment experience to a successor in interest shall become effective as of the first day of the calendar quarter following the acquisition by the successor in interest.  As of the effective date, the successor in interest shall have its employer rate recalculated by merging its existing employment experience, if any, with the employment experience acquired.  If the successor in interest is not an employer as of the date of acquisition, it shall be assigned the new employer rate until the effective date of the transfer of employment experience. (F)   Upon the transfer in whole or in part of the organization, trade, assets or business to a successor in interest, the employment experience shall not be transferred if the successor in interest is not an employer at the time of the acquisition and the controller finds that the successor in interest acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions. (d)   Contributions of workers to the unemployment compensation fund and the State disability benefits fund. (1)  (A)  For periods after January 1, 1975, each worker shall contribute to the fund 1% of his wages with respect to his employment with an employer, which occurs on and after January 1, 1975, after such employer has satisfied the condition set forth in subsection (h) of R.S.43:21-19 with respect to becoming an employer; provided, however, that such contributions shall be at the rate of 1/2 of 1% of wages paid with respect to employment while the worker is in the employ of the State of New Jersey, or any governmental entity or instrumentality which is an employer as defined under R.S.43:21-19(h)(5), or is covered by an approved private plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" or while the worker is exempt from the provisions of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" under section 7 of that law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-31). (B)  Effective January 1, 1978 there shall be no contributions by workers in the employ of any governmental or nongovernmental employer electing or required to make payments in lieu of contributions unless the employer is covered by the State plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-25 et al.), and in that case contributions shall be at the rate of 1/2 of 1%, except that commencing July 1, 1986, workers in the employ of any nongovernmental employer electing or required to make payments in lieu of contributions shall be required to make contributions to the fund at the same rate prescribed for workers of other nongovernmental employers. (C)  (i) Notwithstanding the above provisions of this paragraph (1), during the period starting July 1, 1986 and ending December 31, 1992, each worker shall contribute to the fund 1.125% of wages paid with respect to his employment with a governmental employer electing or required to pay contributions or nongovernmental employer, including a nonprofit organization which is an employer as defined under R.S.43:21-19(h)(6), regardless of whether that nonprofit organization elects or is required to finance its benefit costs with contributions to the fund or by payments in lieu of contributions, after that employer has satisfied the conditions set forth in subsection R.S.43:21-19(h) with respect to becoming an employer.  Contributions, however, shall be at the rate of 0.625% while the worker is covered by an approved private plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" or while the worker is exempt under section 7 of that law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-31) or any other provision of that law; provided that such contributions shall be at the rate of 0.625% of wages paid with respect to employment with the State of New Jersey or any other governmental entity or instrumentality electing or required to make payments in lieu of contributions and which is covered by the State plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," except that, while the worker is exempt from the provisions of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" under section 7 of that law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-31) or any other provision of that law, or is covered for disability benefits by an approved private plan of the employer, the contributions to the fund shall be 0.125%. (ii)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1995, c.422.) (D)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this paragraph (1), during the period starting January 1, 1993 and ending June 30, 1994, each worker shall contribute to the unemployment compensation fund 0.5% of wages paid with respect to the worker's employment with a governmental employer electing or required to pay contributions or nongovernmental employer, including a nonprofit organization which is an employer as defined under paragraph (6) of subsection (h) of R.S.43:21-19, regardless of whether that nonprofit organization elects or is required to finance its benefit costs with contributions to the fund or by payments in lieu of contributions, after that employer has satisfied the conditions set forth in subsection (h) of R.S.43:21-19 with respect to becoming an employer.  No contributions, however, shall be made by the worker while the worker is covered by an approved private plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.) or while the worker is exempt under section 7 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-31) or any other provision of that law; provided that the contributions shall be at the rate of 0.50% of wages paid with respect to employment with the State of New Jersey or any other governmental entity or instrumentality electing or required to make payments in lieu of contributions and which is covered by the State plan under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," except that, while the worker is exempt from the provisions of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" under section 7 of that law, P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-31) or any other provision of that law, or is covered for disability benefits by an approved private plan of the employer, no contributions shall be made to the fund. Each worker shall, starting on January 1, 1996 and ending March 31, 1996, contribute to the unemployment compensation fund 0.60% of wages paid with respect to the worker's employment with a governmental employer electing or required to pay contributions or nongovernmental employer, including a nonprofit organization which is an employer as defined under paragraph (6) of subsection (h) of R.S.43:21-19, regardless of whether that nonprofit organization elects or is required to finance its benefit costs with contributions to the fund or by payments in lieu of contributions, after that employer has satisfied the conditions set forth in subsection (h) of R.S.43:21-19 with respect to becoming an employer, provided that the contributions shall be at the rate of 0.10% of wages paid with respect to employment with the State of New Jersey or any other governmental entity or instrumentality electing or required to make payments in lieu of contributions.

(E)  Each employer shall, notwithstanding any provision of law in this State to the contrary, withhold in trust the amount of his workers' contributions from their wages at the time such wages are paid, shall show such deduction on his payroll records, shall furnish such evidence thereof to his workers as the division or controller may prescribe, and shall transmit all such contributions, in addition to his own contributions, to the office of the controller in such manner and at such times as may be prescribed.  If any employer fails to deduct the contributions of any of his workers at the time their wages are paid, or fails to make a deduction therefor at the time wages are paid for the next succeeding payroll period, he alone shall thereafter be liable for such contributions, and for the purpose of R.S.43:21-14, such contributions shall be treated as employer's contributions required from him.

(3)  (A)  If an employee receives wages from more than one employer during any calendar year, and either the sum of his contributions deposited in and credited to the State disability benefits fund plus the amount of his contributions, if any, required towards the costs of benefits under one or more approved private plans under the provisions of section 9 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-33) and deducted from his wages, or the sum of such latter contributions, if the employee is covered during such calendar year only by two or more private plans, exceeds an amount equal to 1/2 of 1% of the "wages" determined in accordance with the provisions of R.S.43:21-7(b)(3) during the calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 1976 or, during calendar year 2012 or any subsequent calendar year, the total amount of his contributions for the year exceeds the amount set by the annual rate of contribution determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection (d), the employee shall be entitled to a refund of the excess if he makes a claim to the controller within two years after the end of the calendar year in which the wages are received with respect to which the refund is claimed and establishes his right to such refund. Such refund shall be made by the controller from the State disability benefits fund. No interest shall be allowed or paid with respect to any such refund. The controller shall, in accordance with prescribed regulations, determine the portion of the aggregate amount of such refunds made during any calendar year which is applicable to private plans for which deductions were made under section 9 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-33) such determination to be based upon the ratio of the amount of such wages exempt from contributions to such fund, as provided in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to coverage under private plans, to the total wages so exempt plus the amount of such wages subject to contributions to the disability benefits fund, as provided in subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of this subsection. The controller shall, in accordance with prescribed regulations, prorate the amount so determined among the applicable private plans in the proportion that the wages covered by each plan bear to the total private plan wages involved in such refunds, and shall assess against and recover from the employer, or the insurer if the insurer has indemnified the employer with respect thereto, the amount so prorated. The provisions of R.S.43:21-14 with respect to collection of employer contributions shall apply to such assessments. The amount so recovered by the controller shall be paid into the State disability benefits fund. (B)  If an employee receives wages from more than one employer during any calendar year, and the sum of his contributions deposited in the "Family Temporary Disability Leave Account" of the State disability benefits fund plus the amount of his contributions, if any, required towards the costs of family temporary disability leave benefits under one or more approved private plans under the provisions of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-25 et al.) and deducted from his wages, exceeds an amount equal to, during calendar year 2009, 0.09% of the "wages" determined in accordance with the provisions of R.S.43:21-7(b)(3), or during calendar year 2010, 0.12% of those wages, or, during calendar year 2011 or any subsequent calendar year, the percentage of those wages set by the annual rate of contribution determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection (d), the employee shall be entitled to a refund of the excess if he makes a claim to the controller within two years after the end of the calendar year in which the wages are received with respect to which the refund is claimed and establishes his right to the refund. The refund shall be made by the controller from the "Family Temporary Disability Leave Account" of the State disability benefits fund. No interest shall be allowed or paid with respect to any such refund. The controller shall, in accordance with prescribed regulations, determine the portion of the aggregate amount of the refunds made during any calendar year which is applicable to private plans for which deductions were made under section 9 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-33), with that determination based upon the ratio of the amount of such wages exempt from contributions to the fund, as provided in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection (d) with respect to coverage under private plans, to the total wages so exempt plus the amount of such wages subject to contributions to the "Family Temporary Disability Leave Account" of the State disability benefits fund, as provided in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection (d). The controller shall, in accordance with prescribed regulations, prorate the amount so determined among the applicable private plans in the proportion that the wages covered by each plan bear to the total private plan wages involved in such refunds, and shall assess against and recover from the employer, or the insurer if the insurer has indemnified the employer with respect thereto, the prorated amount. The provisions of R.S.43:21-14 with respect to collection of employer contributions shall apply to such assessments. The amount so recovered by the controller shall be paid into the "Family Temporary Disability Leave Account" of the State disability benefits fund. (4)   If an individual does not receive any wages from the employing unit which for the purposes of this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.) is treated as his employer, or receives his wages from some other employing unit, such employer shall nevertheless be liable for such individual's contributions in the first instance; and after payment thereof such employer may deduct the amount of such contributions from any sums payable by him to such employing unit, or may recover the amount of such contributions from such employing unit, or, in the absence of such an employing unit, from such individual, in a civil action; provided proceedings therefor are instituted within three months after the date on which such contributions are payable. General rules shall be prescribed whereby such an employing unit may recover the amount of such contributions from such individuals in the same manner as if it were the employer. (5)   Every employer who has elected to become an employer subject to this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), or to cease to be an employer subject to this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), pursuant to the provisions of R.S.43:21-8, shall post and maintain printed notices of such election on his premises, of such design, in such numbers, and at such places as the director may determine to be necessary to give notice thereof to persons in his service. (6)   Contributions by workers, payable to the controller as herein provided, shall be exempt from garnishment, attachment, execution, or any other remedy for the collection of debts. (e)   Contributions by employers to the State disability benefits fund. (1)   Except as hereinafter provided, each employer shall, in addition to the contributions required by subsections (a), (b), and (c) of this section, contribute 1/2 of 1% of the wages paid by such employer to workers with respect to employment unless he is not a covered employer as defined in subsection (a) of section 3 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" (C.43:21-27 (a)), except that the rate for the State of New Jersey shall be 1/10 of 1% for the calendar year 1980 and for the first six months of 1981. Prior to July 1, 1981 and prior to July 1 each year thereafter, the controller shall review the experience accumulated in the account of the State of New Jersey and establish a rate for the next following fiscal year which, in combination with worker contributions, will produce sufficient revenue to keep the account in balance; except that the rate so established shall not be less than 1/10 of 1%. Such contributions shall become due and be paid by the employer to the controller for the State disability benefits fund as established by law, in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed, and shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in his employ. In the payment of any contributions, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to $0.005 or more, in which case it shall be increased to $0.01. (2)   During the continuance of coverage of a worker by an approved private plan of disability benefits under the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," the employer shall be exempt from the contributions required by paragraph (1) above with respect to wages paid to such worker. (3)  (A)  The rates of contribution as specified in paragraph (1) above shall be subject to modification as provided herein with respect to employer contributions due on and after July 1, 1951. (B)  A separate disability benefits account shall be maintained for each employer required to contribute to the State disability benefits fund and such account shall be credited with contributions deposited in and credited to such fund with respect to employment occurring on and after January 1, 1949. Each employer's account shall be credited with all contributions paid on or before January 31 of any calendar year on his own behalf and on behalf of individuals in his service with respect to employment occurring in preceding calendar years; provided, however, that if January 31 of any calendar year falls on a Saturday or Sunday an employer's account shall be credited as of January 31 of such calendar year with all the contributions which he has paid on or before the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday or Sunday. But nothing in this act shall be construed to grant any employer or individuals in his service prior claims or rights to the amounts paid by him to the fund either on his own behalf or on behalf of such individuals. Benefits paid to any covered individual in accordance with Article III of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" on or before December 31 of any calendar year with respect to disability in such calendar year and in preceding calendar years shall be charged against the account of the employer by whom such individual was employed at the commencement of such disability or by whom he was last employed, if out of employment. (C)  The controller may prescribe regulations for the establishment, maintenance, and dissolution of joint accounts by two or more employers, and shall, in accordance with such regulations and upon application by two or more employers to establish such an account, or to merge their several individual accounts in a joint account, maintain such joint account as if it constituted a single employer's account. (D)  Prior to July 1 of each calendar year, the controller shall make a preliminary determination of the rate of contribution for the 12 months commencing on such July 1 for each employer subject to the contribution requirements of this subsection (e). (1)   Such preliminary rate shall be 1/2 of 1% unless on the preceding January 31 of such year such employer shall have been a covered employer who has paid contributions to the State disability benefits fund with respect to employment in the three calendar years immediately preceding such year. (2)   If the minimum requirements in subparagraph (D) (1) above have been fulfilled and the credited contributions exceed the benefits charged by more than $500.00, such preliminary rate shall be as follows: (i)    2/10 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 exceeds 1% but is less than 1 1/4% of his average annual payroll as defined in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.); (ii)   15/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 1 1/4% but is less than 1 1/2% of his average annual payroll; (iii) 1/10 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 1 1/2% of his average annual payroll. (3)   If the minimum requirements in subparagraph (D) (1) above have been fulfilled and the contributions credited exceed the benefits charged but by not more than $500.00 plus 1% of his average annual payroll, or if the benefits charged exceed the contributions credited but by not more than $500.00, the preliminary rate shall be 1/4 of 1%. (4)   If the minimum requirements in subparagraph (D) (1) above have been fulfilled and the benefits charged exceed the contributions credited by more than $500.00, such preliminary rate shall be as follows: (i)    35/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 is less than 1/4 of 1% of his average annual payroll; (ii)   45/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 1/4 of 1% but is less than 1/2 of 1% of his average annual payroll; (iii) 55/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 1/2 of 1% but is less than 3/4 of 1% of his average annual payroll; (iv) 65/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 3/4 of 1% but is less than 1% of his average annual payroll; (v)   75/100 of 1% if such excess over $500.00 equals or exceeds 1% of his average annual payroll. (5)   Determination of the preliminary rate as specified in subparagraphs (D)(2), (3) and (4) above shall be subject, however, to the condition that it shall in no event be decreased by more than 1/10 of 1% of wages or increased by more than 2/10 of 1% of wages from the preliminary rate determined for the preceding year in accordance with subparagraph (D) (1), (2), (3) or (4), whichever shall have been applicable. (E)  (1)  Prior to July 1 of each calendar year the controller shall determine the amount of the State disability benefits fund as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year, increased by the contributions paid thereto during January of the current calendar year with respect to employment occurring in the preceding calendar year. If such amount exceeds the net amount withdrawn from the unemployment trust fund pursuant to section 23 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-47) plus the amount at the end of such preceding calendar year of the unemployment disability account as defined in section 22 of said law (C.43:21-46), such excess shall be expressed as a percentage of the wages on which contributions were paid to the State disability benefits fund on or before January 31 with respect to employment in the preceding calendar year. (2)   The controller shall then make a final determination of the rates of contribution for the 12 months commencing July 1 of such year for employers whose preliminary rates are determined as provided in subparagraph (D) hereof, as follows: (i)    If the percentage determined in accordance with subparagraph (E)(1) of this paragraph equals or exceeds 1 1/4%, the final employer rates shall be the preliminary rates determined as provided in subparagraph (D) hereof, except that if the employer's preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(2) or subparagraph (D)(3) hereof, the final employer rate shall be the preliminary employer rate decreased by such percentage of excess taken to the nearest 5/100 of 1%, but in no case shall such final rate be less than 1/10 of 1%. (ii)   If the percentage determined in accordance with subparagraph (E)(1) of this paragraph equals or exceeds 3/4 of 1% and is less than 1 1/4 of 1%, the final employer rates shall be the preliminary employer rates. (iii) If the percentage determined in accordance with subparagraph (E)(1) of this paragraph is less than 3/4 of 1%, but in excess of 1/4 of 1%, the final employer rates shall be the preliminary employer rates determined as provided in subparagraph (D) hereof increased by the difference between 3/4 of 1% and such percentage taken to the nearest 5/100 of 1%; provided, however, that no such final rate shall be more than 1/4 of 1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(2) hereof, more than 1/2 of 1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(1) and subparagraph (D)(3) hereof, nor more than 3/4 of 1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(4) hereof. (iv)  If the amount of the State disability benefits fund determined as provided in subparagraph (E)(1) of this paragraph is equal to or less than 1/4 of 1%, then the final rate shall be 2/5 of 1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(2) hereof, 7/10 of 1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(1) and subparagraph (D)(3) hereof, and 1.1% in the case of an employer whose preliminary rate is determined as provided in subparagraph (D)(4) hereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any determination made by the controller with respect to any 12-month period commencing on July 1, 1970, the final rates for all employers for the period beginning January 1, 1971, shall be as set forth herein.

(cf: P.L.2020, c.23, s.6) 6.    Section 16 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-40) is amended to read as follows: 16.  a.  For periods of disability commencing on or after October 1, 1984, an individual's weekly benefit rate shall be two-thirds of his average weekly wage, subject to a maximum of 53% of the Statewide average weekly remuneration paid to workers by employers, as determined under subsection (c) of R.S.43:21-3, except as provided in subsection b. of this section. b.  (1)  For periods of disability commencing on or after July 1, 2020, and for periods of family temporary disability leave commencing on or after July 1, 2020 and before June 30, 2026, an individual's weekly benefit rate shall be 85% of the individual's average weekly wage, subject to a maximum of 70% of the Statewide average weekly remuneration paid to workers by employers. (2)   For periods of family temporary disability leave commencing on or after July 1, 2026, an individual's basic weekly benefit rate shall be 100% of the individual's average weekly wage, subject to a maximum of 100% of the Statewide average weekly remuneration paid to workers by employers. (3)   In the case of a period of family temporary disability leave commencing on or after July 1, 2026 taken following the birth or placement of a child as specified by the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection o. of section 3 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27), the individual may elect to take benefits for a period of longer than the 12 weeks otherwise provided by paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of section 15 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-39), but the weekly benefit amount shall be a reduced amount which shall be calculated by multiplying by 12 the individuals basic weekly benefit rate determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection b. and dividing that total amount by the total number of weeks, but not more than 24 weeks, in which the individual elects to take the benefits.  The division, upon making the determination of the basic weekly benefit rate pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection b., shall inform the individual of that determination and the option for the individual to choose a number of weeks of benefits from 13 to 24 weeks and inform the individual what the individuals weekly benefit rate would be for each number of weeks the individual may elect to take pursuant to this paragraph (3). c.     Each individual's benefit rate shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1.00 if not already a multiple thereof.  The amount of benefits for each day of disability for which benefits are payable shall be one-seventh of the corresponding weekly benefit amount; provided that the total benefits for a fractional part of a week shall be computed to the next lower multiple of $1.00 if not already a multiple thereof. d.    For any week beginning on or after the effective date of P.L.2019, c.126, with respect to a period of disability of an individual who is otherwise eligible for benefits but only able to return to work on a reduced basis while recovering from the disability, the individual, if permitted by the employer to return to work on the reduced basis, shall be paid an amount of benefits with respect to that week such that the sum of the wages and those benefits paid to the individual, rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.00, will equal the weekly benefit amount the individual would have been paid if totally unable to perform the duties of employment due to disability, provided that: (1)   The individual must have been totally unable to perform the duties of employment due to disability and receiving full benefits for at least seven consecutive days prior to claiming partial benefits under this subsection; (2)   The maximum duration of partial benefits paid pursuant to this subsection is eight weeks, unless the division, after a review of medical documentation from a qualified healthcare provider, approves in writing an extension beyond eight weeks, but in no case shall the duration be extended to more than 12 weeks; and (3)   If the individual is able to return to work on a reduced basis but the employer is unable or otherwise chooses not to permit the individual to do so, the individual will continue to be eligible for benefits until the individual is fully recovered from the disability and able to perform the duties of employment, but nothing in this subsection shall be construed as increasing the total number of weeks of disability benefits for which the individual is eligible. For the purposes of this section, "qualified healthcare provider" means a legally licensed physician, dentist, podiatrist, chiropractor, certified nurse midwife, advanced practice nurse or public health nurse designated by the division. (cf: P.L.2019, c.126, s.2) 7.    Section 21 of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2) is amended to read as follows: 21. a.  The division shall implement disability insurance [goals] requirements for the timely determination and prompt payment of temporary disability benefits and family temporary disability benefits under the State plan, as follows: (1)   for temporary disability benefits, in each calendar year: (a)   not less than 40 percent of the original benefit determinations shall be completed within seven days after the commencement of the disability, or the receipt of the benefit claims by the division, whichever is later;

(2)   the number and percentage of claims received with insufficient information, what portion of those claims were because of failure of claimants to provide sufficient information, what portion of those claims were because of failures of medical providers of claimants to provide sufficient information, and what portion of those claims were because of failures of employers to provide sufficient information; (3)   the number and percentage of claims for which determinations were delayed because of employer failure to make the notifications or disclosures to employees and the division within the amount of time required by subsection (a) of section 25 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-49) or subsection f. or g. of section 10 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1), the number of complaints received related to employer noncompliance with those requirements, and the number of employers which have been, because of the failures, required, pursuant to section 31 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-55), to pay fines or penalties to the division or added amounts to claimants, the total amount of payments to the division, and the total amount of payments to claimants; (4)   the number of personnel in the division and the budgeted cost of salaries and benefits for those personnel; the number of personnel who are processing family temporary disability benefit claims, the number processing other temporary disability claims, and the budgeted cost of salaries and benefits for those personnel;

and (5)   if any of the [disability insurance goals set pursuant to] requirements of this section for the timely determination and prompt payment of temporary disability benefits and family temporary disability benefits were not [attained] met during the year, or it is determined that there are other significant problems in the administration of the disability insurance system, the report shall provide an evaluation of the causes of the deficiencies and a plan to correct them and that plan shall include: (a)   any increase in personnel needed to process claims and make benefit payments [expeditiously and] accurately and as expeditiously as is required by subsection a. of this section; (b)   any measures needed to enforce notification and reporting requirements; (c)   any measures needed to inform employers and employees of their responsibilities to facilitate the timely provision of benefits; (d)   any improvements needed in data processing, telephone and other communications technology, staff training, and other administrative services and equipment; (e)   any measures needed to improve service to claimants and beneficiaries, including implementing easy-to-use, user-friendly application processes, facilitating rapid response times to inquiries and applications, and providing easy access to assistance; and (f)   any other measures appropriate for a full modernization of the administration of all aspects of the disability insurance system.

[The commissioner shall use that increased estimate in setting the rate of contributions pursuant to those subsections, except that the increase may not result in the total amount credited to those administrative costs exceeding the maximum amount permitted pursuant to subsection (a) of section 22 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-46).] c. (1) The division shall, during each fiscal year commencing on or after July 1, 2019, allocate not less than $1,200,000 to disseminate information about the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees regarding temporary disability benefits and family temporary disability benefits by means of programs of educational outreach in communities and workplaces.  Of that annual allocation, not less than $600,000 shall be used by the division to enter into contracts with community-based organizations to disseminate information to workers regarding temporary disability benefits and family temporary disability benefits.  That allocation shall be regarded as a cost of administration of temporary disability and family temporary disability benefits and be charged to the administration account of the State disability benefit fund.  Of the costs charged to the administration account of the State disability benefit fund pursuant to this subsection, the percentage which is charged to the Family Temporary Disability Leave Account shall be equal to the percentage that family temporary disability benefits represents of all temporary disability benefits paid from the State disability benefits fund during the preceding calendar year. The allocation made pursuant to this subsection, including any adjustments in the allocation specified in the plan provided pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall not result in the total amount credited to administrative costs exceeding the maximum amount permitted pursuant to subsection (a) of section 22 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-46). (2)   The commissioner shall, not later than September 30 of the years 2020 through 2024 and [September 30] not later than August 31 of 2025 and each subsequent year, in consultation with the State Auditor, issue, provide to the Legislature, file with the State Auditor, and make available to the public on the department's webpage, a report regarding efforts made during the preceding calendar year by the division and by community-based organizations to disseminate information about the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees regarding temporary disability and family temporary disability benefits.  Each report shall include, for that preceding calendar year: (a)   an accounting of all funds allocated pursuant to this subsection and all expenditures made from those funds by the division and each community-based organization entering into contracts with the division pursuant to this subsection, and estimates of the number of employers and the number of workers to which the information was disseminated; (b)   an estimate of the number of workers who were eligible for temporary disability and family temporary disability benefits and what percentage of those workers received those benefits, including an assessment of whatever progress was made to increase that percentage; and (c)   a plan to increase the percentage of workers who are aware of the benefits which specifies the amounts to be allocated to the division and community-based organizations for the purposes of this subsection during the subsequent calendar year, provided that the amounts specified shall not be less than or more than the minimum and maximum amounts indicated in paragraph (1) of this subsection. (cf: P.L.2019, c.37, s.21) 8. (New section)    a. The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, in collaboration with the Department of Health, shall prepare a survey to be provided to individuals who have taken continuous child bonding leave pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection o. of section 3 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27), within one year of birth or placement of the child for which leave was taken. Participation by individuals in the survey shall be optional.  The survey shall include, but not be limited to, questions regarding: (1)   demographic information including age, sex, educational attainment, and ethnicity; (2)   duration of leave requested, and the duration of leave taken and amount of benefits; (3)   employment status including full or part-time employment and if the individual has more than one employer; (4)   breastfeeding duration, including incidence of exclusive breastfeeding at three and six months after birth; (5)   healthcare provider visits for well-baby, maternity care, and re-hospitalizations; and (6)   parental physical and emotional well-being, including symptoms of depression. b.    Data from this survey shall be anonymized and made publically available through the Department of Health, in a similar manner to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). 9.   This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases the basic family leave insurance (FLI) weekly benefit payments to 100 percent of a workers average weekly wage up to 100 percent of the Statewide average weekly wage. The bill increases, from 12 to 24 consecutive weeks, the maximum duration of family leave time that can be claimed for bonding with newborn or newly adopted children.  The bill provides that in a case of an eligible individual electing to take more than the current maximum of 12 weeks of benefits, the department will determine a reduced weekly benefit rate for the weeks after the first 12 weeks by multiplying by 12 the individuals basic weekly benefit and dividing the resulting total amount by the total number of weeks of benefits that the individual elects to take (including the first 12 weeks of benefits), thus preventing any increase in the total amount of benefits paid. The bill provides that the rights provided by the Family Leave Act for leave takers to be reinstated after taking family leave would be extended beyond the usual maximum of 12 weeks in the case of an individual who elects, pursuant to the bill, to take additional leave for child bonding. The bill offsets the cost of increasing FLI basic benefit rates and permits a reduction of the FLI and temporary disability insurance (TDI) tax rates by making sufficient adjustments to the portion of total wages which are subject to workers contributions to the State TDI fund and the FLI account of that fund. The bill provides that worker tax rates for TDI and FLI be determined on the basis of estimates of anticipated costs of benefits and administration without reference to amounts paid in previous years.  The Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DOLWD) is required, before finalizing the tax rates, to report its proposed tax rates to the Joint Budget Oversight Committee (JBOC), which is required to review the proposed rates for compliance with the law and approve or disapprove them within 20 business days, and, if disapproved, provide alternative rates. The DOLWD is required to finalize rates upon approval by the JBOC, finalize alternative rates provided by the JBOC, or finalize the proposed rates at the end of the 20-day period if the JBOC takes no action.  The bill designates the laws claims processing standards to be requirements, not goals, and requires that the report submitted to the JBOC on proposed tax rates include a plan to correct failures to meet the standards and that the proposed tax rates are sufficient to implement the plan. The DOLWD is directed to develop a survey in collaboration with the Department of Health to collect information on those taking continuous child bonding leave to gather data on various metrics including physical and emotional well-being and breastfeeding duration.  The bill requires that anonymized survey data be made public by the Department of Health. Comprehensive paid parental leave is crucial for the well-being of children and families.  There is much evidence that increasing to 24 weeks the maximum duration of leave for bonding with newborn or newly-adopted children will assist in improving breastfeeding rates, maternal and infant health metrics including postpartum depression symptoms, and long-term participation of women in the workforce.  Raising the reimbursement rate for family leave underscores the social value of caregiving and may help address socio-economic gender disparities.
