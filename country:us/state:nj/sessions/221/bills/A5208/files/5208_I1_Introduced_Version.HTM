<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. (New section) This act
shall be known and may be cited as the Comprehensive Reimbursement and Duration
of Leave Expansion Act or CRADLE Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2. (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    New Jersey recognizes
that comprehensive parental leave policies are crucial for the well-being of
children and families. The average length of parental leave in Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development <a
href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/data/datasets/family-database/pf2_1_parental_leave_systems.pdf"><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>(OECD) countries</span></a> is 33
weeks, with most countries offering between 26 and 52 weeks of leave. New
Jersey has been a leader in paid family leave insurance, but further expansion
is necessary to ensure the State keeps pace with evolving family needs and
scientific recommendations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Extensions of paid
maternity leave have been associated with improvements in a variety of metrics
including: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Postpartum depression.  In
Hong Kong, a nationally mandated four-week extension of maternity leave was
associated with a 22 percent decrease in the number of mothers experiencing
postnatal depression symptoms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Infant mortality rates.  Multiple
studies have found that a 10-week extension of maternity leave is associated
with a significant decrease in infant mortality rates, upwards of three percent
in OECD countries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Socioeconomic and health
outcomes.  Globally, an increase of 10 weeks of maternity leave at full pay was
associated with a 10 percent decrease in neonatal and infant mortality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  Female participation in
the workforce.  Domestically, Google lowered attrition rates by over 50 percent
for postpartum employees by increasing their paid parental leave from three to
five months and offering full-pay wage replacement.  A multi-country analysis
spanning two decades found that an increase in the duration of paid leave, from
an average of 10 weeks to 33 weeks, was associated with an increase in the
female employment ratio by over two percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) Breastfeeding duration.  In
Chile, a national extension of maternity leave from 12 to 24 weeks increased
rates of exclusive breastfeeding at six months of age by 43 percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The World Health
Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends six months of
exclusive breastfeeding for newborns optimal development and health.  Breastfeeding
can improve infant immunity and lower the risks of diseases including
respiratory infections, asthma, and diabetes.  There is a strong and well-studied
correlation between women returning to work and breastfeeding cessation.  Women
receiving at least 12 weeks of leave were more likely to initiate and maintain
breastfeeding for at least six months. This is particularly pronounced in
low-income women who have the <a

style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>lowest rates</span></a> of exclusive
breastfeeding at six months in the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Postpartum depression
affects at least 16,000 women in New Jersey each year.  Untreated postpartum
depression can cause intense feelings of sadness, anxiety, and poor
infant-mother bonding, which can, in its most serious forms, progress into
self-harm, suicidal, or filicidal ideations or actions. While there are many
biological factors that affect postpartum depression risk including hormone
levels and a family history of depression, sociocultural factors such as
financial stress, domestic violence, and poor societal support have also been
associated with heightened risk for postpartum depression.  There is a wealth
of empirical data that maternity leave times, especially those over 12 weeks in
length, are associated with decreased rates of postpartum depression symptoms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.    Paid parental leave
allows families to care for their infants at home for longer, increasing the
likelihood of accessing necessary healthcare and avoiding the increased risk of
illness associated with attending childcare.  Implementation of New Yorks paid
family leave policy was associated with an 18 percent decrease in doctors
visits for respiratory infections in young infants.  <a

likelihood of attending a well-baby visit, and in receiving timely

percentile for full-time infant care in New Jersey was $1,750, which was 13
percent higher than the Statewide average weekly wage.  Aside from savings in
childcare costs, paid parental leave stabilizes womens employment status and
income.  It is reported that women who took paid maternity leave were up to 40
percent less likely to receive public assistance in the year following
childbirth, even when controlling for variables such as wage, education
attainment, and age.  Paid parental leave may also have long-lasting benefits,
especially for women.  Poverty in old age is <a
href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/publication/PB_142.pdf"><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>heavily skewed</span></a> towards
women, due to longer lifespans, lower workforce participation, lower wages, and
lower pensions or retirement contributions compared to men.  Enabling women to
stay in paid work may help mitigate the high levels of old age poverty for
women in the future. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    High rates of
reimbursement reaffirm that care work is socially valued.  Unpaid care work largely
falls on women and reinforces socioeconomic disadvantages.  In New Jersey,
women made up about 70 percent of all individuals who took caregiving leave in
2022.  A review of global family leave policies notes that: When leave
policies replace only a small share of income, the lower earner in a household
 disproportionately women due to persisting gender wage gaps  will be more
likely to take it. Moreover, low wage replacement rates exacerbate
socioeconomic inequalities since workers with lower incomes and fewer assets
will be less able to afford a reduction in pay.</p>

or more private plans, exceeds an amount equal to 1/2 of 1% of the
&quot;wages&quot; determined in accordance with the provisions of
R.S.43:21-7(b)(3) during the calendar years beginning on or after January 1,
1976 or, during calendar year 2012 or any subsequent calendar year, the total
amount of his contributions for the year exceeds the amount set by the annual
rate of contribution determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce
Development pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1)(G) of this subsection
(d), the employee shall be entitled to a refund of the excess if he makes a
claim to the controller within two years after the end of the calendar year in
which the wages are received with respect to which the refund is claimed and
establishes his right to such refund. Such refund shall be made by the
controller from the State disability benefits fund. No interest shall be
allowed or paid with respect to any such refund. The controller shall, in
accordance with prescribed regulations, determine the portion of the aggregate
amount of such refunds made during any calendar year which is applicable to
private plans for which deductions were made under section 9 of the
&quot;Temporary Disability Benefits Law&quot; (C.43:21-33) such determination

plans in the proportion that the wages covered by each plan bear to the total
private plan wages involved in such refunds, and shall assess against and
recover from the employer, or the insurer if the insurer has indemnified the
employer with respect thereto, the amount so prorated. The provisions of
R.S.43:21-14 with respect to collection of employer contributions shall apply

percentage of those wages set by the annual rate of contribution determined by
the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to subparagraph

to a refund of the excess if he makes a claim to the controller within two
years after the end of the calendar year in which the wages are received with

The refund shall be made by the controller from the &quot;Family Temporary
Disability Leave Account&quot; of the State disability benefits fund. No interest
shall be allowed or paid with respect to any such refund. The controller shall,
in accordance with prescribed regulations, determine the portion of the
aggregate amount of the refunds made during any calendar year which is
applicable to private plans for which deductions were made under section 9 of
the &quot;Temporary Disability Benefits Law&quot; (C.43:21-33), with that
determination based upon the ratio of the amount of such wages exempt from

(d) with respect to coverage under private plans, to the total wages so exempt
plus the amount of such wages subject to contributions to the &quot;Family
Temporary Disability Leave Account&quot; of the State disability benefits fund,

The controller shall, in accordance with prescribed regulations, prorate the
amount so determined among the applicable private plans in the proportion that
the wages covered by each plan bear to the total private plan wages involved in

the account of the State of New Jersey and establish a rate for the next
following fiscal year which, in combination with worker contributions, will
produce sufficient revenue to keep the account in balance; except that the rate
so established shall not be less than 1/10 of 1%. Such contributions shall
become due and be paid by the employer to the controller for the State
disability benefits fund as established by law, in accordance with such
regulations as may be prescribed, and shall not be deducted, in whole or in
part, from the remuneration of individuals in his employ. In the payment of any

average weekly wage up to 100 percent of the Statewide average weekly wage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill increases, from 12 to
24 consecutive weeks, the maximum duration of family leave time that can be
claimed for bonding with newborn or newly adopted children.  The bill provides
that in a case of an eligible individual electing to take more than the current
maximum of 12 weeks of benefits, the department will determine a reduced weekly
benefit rate for the weeks after the first 12 weeks by multiplying by 12 the
individuals basic weekly benefit and dividing the resulting total amount by
the total number of weeks of benefits that the individual elects to take
(including the first 12 weeks of benefits), thus preventing any increase in the
total amount of benefits paid.</p>

rights provided by the Family Leave Act for leave takers to be reinstated after
taking family leave would be extended beyond the usual maximum of 12 weeks in
the case of an individual who elects, pursuant to the bill, to take additional
leave for child bonding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill offsets the cost of increasing
FLI basic benefit rates and permits a reduction of the FLI and temporary
disability insurance (TDI) tax rates by making sufficient adjustments to the
portion of total wages which are subject to workers contributions to the State
TDI fund and the FLI account of that fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that worker
tax rates for TDI and FLI be determined on the basis of estimates of
anticipated costs of benefits and administration without reference to amounts
paid in previous years.  The Department of Labor and Workforce Development
(DOLWD) is required, before finalizing the tax rates, to report its proposed
tax rates to the Joint Budget Oversight Committee (JBOC), which is required to
review the proposed rates for compliance with the law and approve or disapprove
them within 20 business days, and, if disapproved, provide alternative rates. 
The DOLWD is required to finalize rates upon approval by the JBOC, finalize
alternative rates provided by the JBOC, or finalize the proposed rates at the
end of the 20-day period if the JBOC takes no action.  The bill designates the
laws claims processing standards to be requirements, not goals, and requires
that the report submitted to the JBOC on proposed tax rates include a plan to
correct failures to meet the standards and that the proposed tax rates are
sufficient to implement the plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The DOLWD is directed to
develop a survey in collaboration with the Department of Health to collect
information on those taking continuous child bonding leave to gather data on
various metrics including physical and emotional well-being and breastfeeding
duration.  The bill requires that anonymized survey data be made public by the
Department of Health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Comprehensive paid parental
leave is crucial for the well-being of children and families.  There is much
evidence that increasing to 24 weeks the maximum duration of leave for bonding with
newborn or newly-adopted children will assist in improving breastfeeding rates,
maternal and infant health metrics including postpartum depression symptoms,
and long-term participation of women in the workforce.  Raising the
reimbursement rate for family leave underscores the social value of caregiving
and may help address socio-economic gender disparities.</p>
