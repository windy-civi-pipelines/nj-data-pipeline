<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides employers
with various tax incentives for hiring and accommodating persons with
disabilities under the insurance premiums tax, the corporation business tax and
the gross income tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill makes the Division of
Vocational Rehabilitation Services in the New Jersey Department of Labor and
Workforce Development  the  lead agency in  handling the determination of the
potential members of the population who will qualify as the workers whose
employment is the target of the bill.   The bill directs the division to
identify and certify persons seeking employment who have a disability as
defined by the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  That is, <span
lang=EN>a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life
activity, and which disability constitutes an impediment to </span>obtaining or
maintaining employment or to transitioning from school to work.  This
certification can, if the job-seeker chooses, be taken on interviews for
employment and shown to employers, and the certification later assists in
employers applying for the credits allowed by the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows employers
three credits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     First, an <i>employment credit</i>. 
An employer is allowed a credit equal to 30 percent of up to the first $6,000
of the wages paid by the employer to the qualified employee with a disability
during the first year of employment.  That is, the employer of a qualified
employee with a disability is allowed up to $1,800 in the first year of
employment.  The employer is also allowed a credit of 20 percent of up to the
first $6,000 of the wages paid by the employer to the qualified employee with a
disability during the second year of employment.  That is, the employer is allowed
up to $1,200 in the second year of employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Second, the bill allows a <i>transportation
credit</i>.  The employer is allowed a credit equal to up to $600 of the
transportation expenses that are incurred by the employer in the taxable period
to enable each qualified employee with a disability to travel to and from work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Third, the bill allows an <i>accommodation
credit.</i>  This is a piggy-back of a federal credit for expenditures
incurred to make a business accessible to individuals with disabilities.  The bill
allows an eligible small business, that is a business with less than
$1,000,000 in gross receipts, or if it has higher gross receipts with no more
than 30 employees, to take a credit equal to 10 percent of expenditures for the
taxable period in excess of $250 but not to exceed $10,250 to increase
accessibility for individuals with disabilities, both employees and members of
the public.  This can include removal of architectural or communications
barriers, methods for making aurally delivered materials available to the
hearing impaired, methods for making visually delivered materials available to
the visually impaired, special equipment or equipment modifications for
individuals with disabilities, or similar investments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows employers,
potentially, to take all three of the employment, transportation and
accommodation credits.  The employment credit allowed by this bill is not a
credit for creating new jobs, but applies to a hire in an existing position <i>or</i>
in a newly  created  position, so, unlike  the  various  new jobs credits <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>offered by law (which forbid an
employer from taking more than one credit for a single newly-created position)
an employer may qualify for the employment credit under this bill and any other
employment credit available.</p>
