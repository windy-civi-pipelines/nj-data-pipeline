S1642 SENATE, No. 1642 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  ANDREW ZWICKER District 16 (Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset) Co-Sponsored by: Senator Vitale SYNOPSIS Prohibits government dealings with businesses associated with Azerbaijan. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act prohibiting government dealings with businesses associated with Azerbaijan and supplementing chapter 32 of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.), chapter 18A of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes, P.L.1986, c.43 (C.18A:64-52 et seq.), P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.1 et seq.), and P.L.1950, c.270 (C.52:18A-79 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  The State is deeply concerned about the welfare and rights of Dr. Gubad Ibadoghlu, who is being detained in Azerbaijan. b.  Gubad Ibadoghlu is an esteemed economist who has promoted good governance and public financial transparency.  He has shared his expertise all over the world and has been affiliated with various institutions of higher education in Europe and the United States, including Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey and Princeton University. c.  In addition to his scholarly work, Dr. Ibadoghlu is a prominent political activist who has been critical of the Azerbaijani government. d.    Azerbaijani authorities arrested Ibadoghlu in July 2023 on charges of production, acquisition, or sale of counterfeit money. e.     Ibadoghlus arrest continues a longstanding trend of pursuing dubious charges against government critics in Azerbaijan, a trend that runs counter to the democratic principle of free speech. f.     Given that New Jersey law prohibits government dealings with businesses associated with other countries that have records of human rights offenses, it is in the public interest to adopt a similar policy with respect to Azerbaijan. 2.  a. A person that is identified on a list created pursuant to subsection b. of this section as a person that has been determined to engage in prohibited activities in Azerbaijan shall be ineligible to and shall not: (1)  enter into or renew a contract with the State of New Jersey for the provision of goods and services or the purchase of bonds or other obligations; (2)  file or renew a Public Works Contractor Registration with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development; (3) be approved for or continue to receive an economic development subsidy from the Economic Development Authority in but not of the Department of the Treasury; (4)   be awarded a municipal property tax abatement, or make or enter into a payment in-lieu of property tax agreement; (5) apply for or receive a tax clearance certificate from the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury; (6)  be certified by the Department of Community Affairs as an urban renewal entity for purposed of the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.); and (7)  be designated as a redeveloper by a public agency for the purpose of planning, replanning, construction, or undertaking of any project or redevelopment work in accordance with the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.). b. Immediately upon the effective date of this section, the Department of the Treasury shall, using credible information available to the public, begin developing a list of persons it determines engage in prohibited activities in Azerbaijan.  The department is authorized to consult an independent research firm that specializes in global security risk for portfolio determinations, as selected by the State Treasurer, to develop the list.  The department shall update the list on a rolling basis.  Beginning after the 91st day following the date of enactment of this section, the department shall be required to update the list at least every six months. Before including a person or entity on the initial list or an updated list, the department shall: (1)  provide notice of its intent to include the person on the list.  The notice shall inform the person that inclusion on the list would make the person ineligible to engage in any of the enumerated activities specified by subsection a. of this section; and (2)  provide a person with an opportunity to comment in writing that the person is not engaged in prohibited activities in Azerbaijan.  If the person demonstrates to the department that the person is not engaged in prohibited activities in Azerbaijan, the person or entity shall not be included on the list. c.  A State agency or local unit, as applicable, shall require a person seeking to engage in any of the enumerated activities specified in subsection a. of this section to certify, before the contract is awarded, renewed, amended, or extended, or before applying for certification as an urban renewal entity or designation as a redeveloper, that the person is not identified on a list created pursuant to this section as a person engaging in prohibited activities in Azerbaijan.  The certification required shall be executed on behalf of the applicable person by an authorized officer or representative of the person.  If a person is unable to make the certification required because the person or one of the persons parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates has engaged in prohibited activity in Azerbaijan, the person shall provide to the State agency or local unit of government concerned, prior to the deadline for delivery of such certification, a detailed and precise description of such activities, such description to be provided under penalty of perjury.
