production companies in any fiscal year pursuant to this subsection is less
than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in
that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax
credits available for approval to each such category in that fiscal year, and

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
&quot;Next New Jersey Program&quot; within the New Jersey Economic Development
Authority (EDA) and modifies certain provisions of the &quot;New Jersey
Economic Recovery Act of 2020,&quot; P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of the Next New
Jersey Program would be to attract new investment to New Jersey in the
artificial intelligence (or AI) industry and AI-related industries, create
new jobs and economic opportunities, and to position New Jersey as a leader in
the innovation economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the program, the EDA
would provide tax credits to eligible businesses, following approval of an
application by the EDA, to eligible AI businesses.  Eligible AI businesses
would include a business or division that is primarily engaged in the
artificial intelligence industry or large-scale artificial intelligence data
center industry.  A business would be considered primarily engaged in such an
industry if at least 50 percent of the businesss employees are engaged in
AI-related activities, or at least 50 percent of the businesss revenue is
generated from AI-related activities.  The bill defines &quot;artificial
intelligence&quot; or &quot;AI&quot; to mean the development of software and
hardware, and the end-use application of technologies that are able to perform
tasks normally requiring human intelligence, including, but not limited to,
visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, translation between
languages, and<span style='font-family:"Garamond",serif;color:#1F1F1F;
letter-spacing:0pt'> </span>generative artificial intelligence, which generates
new content in response to user inputs of data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that an
eligible business that executes a project agreement with the EDA pursuant to
the provisions of the Next New Jersey Program may receive tax credits as authorized
under the project agreement.  The bill defines &quot;project&quot; to mean a
capital investment at a qualified business facility and an employment
commitment specified in the eligible businesss project agreement.  The bill
defines &quot;qualified business facility&quot; to mean any building, complex
of buildings, or structural components of buildings, and all machinery and
equipment located therein, used in connection with the operation of an eligible
business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the amount of
the tax credit allowed for a particular project would equal to the lesser of: 
(1) the product of 0.1 percent of the eligible businesss total capital
investment multiplied by the number of new full-time jobs; (2) 25 percent of
the eligible businesss total capital investment; or (3) $250 million.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that up to
$500 million in tax credits, originally allocated for the New Jersey Aspire
Program and the Emerge Program, be made available to eligible AI businesses
under the Next New Jersey Program.  Additionally, the bill provides that if the
EDA awards less than the annual limitation of tax credits under the New Jersey
Aspire Program and the Emerge Program, then the uncommitted credits would also
be made available to eligible AI businesses under the Next New Jersey Program. </p>
