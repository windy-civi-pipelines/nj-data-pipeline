STATEMENT This bill revises the manner by which a tax collector may become certified in the collection of property taxes in municipalities that operate on the State fiscal year budget cycle, rather than on a calendar year budget cycle. Currently, a candidate for certification as a tax collector is required to take, and pass, an additional portion of the certification test related to State fiscal year tax collection in order to serve as a tax collector in a State fiscal year municipality.  Many candidates do not elect to take the State fiscal year portion of the examination.   This has resulted in comparatively fewer certified tax collectors who are certified to serve as a tax collector in a municipality that operates on a State fiscal year budget cycle. This bill would revise the process for certification as a tax collector for State fiscal year municipalities by allowing a candidate to simply take an additional course in order to attain that certification.
