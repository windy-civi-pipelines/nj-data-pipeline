STATEMENT This joint resolution designates September 15 of each year as World Afro Day in New Jersey. Beginning on September 15, 2017 in the United Kingdom, World Afro Day has stood as a celebration of natural hair and as an educational event to teach about Afro hair.  The date was chosen to mark the day in 2016 when the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rescinding of a job offer for Chastity Jones, who had her job offer rescinded for refusing to cut her dreadlocks.  The court later withdrew this opinion and issued a revised opinion with the same outcome. The organization World Afro Day provides educational resources and hosts events to teach about natural hair and end hair discrimination.  Afro hairstyles have been discriminated against for centuries.  This has led to exclusion, bias, and low self-esteem.  New Jersey recognized this problem and passed the Create a Respectful and Open Workspace for Natural Hair Act in 2019.  Positive representations of natural hair and shifting perspectives on natural hair are crucial to creating an inclusive and welcoming environment where all residents of New Jersey can thrive.
