The bill: 1)   delineates the responsibilities of the board, which include the approval of licensure applications, and recognition of entities accrediting midwifery certification programs and national entities issuing the certifications; 2)   reviews, as deemed appropriate, the  continuing education hours completed by licensees based on levels of certification; 3)   requires applicants to meet certain standards to qualify for a license; and 4)   authorizes the State Board of Midwifery to grant individuals currently licensed as a CM, CNM, or CPM by the State Board of Medical Examiners a license at that same level. Under the bill, the Department of Banking and Insurance is to require medical malpractice insurance providers authorized to provide insurance in New Jersey to cover certified professional midwives.  Additionally, health insurance carriers authorized to provide coverage in the State are to cover home births if an individual is approved to have a home birth. The bill stipulates that licensees are to complete continuing education credits in accordance with the respective credentialing body for each level of certification, which is to include at least one hour on implicit and explicit bias, and if a licensee is authorized to prescribe drugs.  The board may, in its discretion, waive requirements for continuing education for a licensee if the licensee can demonstrate a hardship, including, but not limited to, a disability, military service or deployment, or other good cause.  Moreover, the bill reinstates a licensed midwife as a member of the State Board of Medical Examiners.

STATEMENT This bill modifies current law regulating midwives.  Specifically, the bill repeals the current law requiring approval for licensure of midwives by the State Board of Medical Examiners and establishes a State Board of Midwifery.  Under the bill, a board of 11 members, seven of whom are to be midwives, is created to oversee the licensure of certified midwives (CMs), certified nurse midwives (CNMs), and certified professional midwives (CPMs). The bill: 1)   delineates the responsibilities of the board, which include the approval of licensure applications, and recognition of entities accrediting midwifery certification programs and national entities issuing the certifications; 2)   reviews, as deemed appropriate, the  continuing education hours completed by licensees based on levels of certification; 3)   requires applicants to meet certain standards to qualify for a license; and 4)   authorizes the State Board of Midwifery to grant individuals currently licensed as a CM, CNM, or CPM by the State Board of Medical Examiners a license at that same level. Under the bill, the Department of Banking and Insurance is to require medical malpractice insurance providers authorized to provide insurance in New Jersey to cover certified professional midwives.  Additionally, health insurance carriers authorized to provide coverage in the State are to cover home births if an individual is approved to have a home birth. The bill stipulates that licensees are to complete continuing education credits in accordance with the respective credentialing body for each level of certification, which is to include at least one hour on implicit and explicit bias, and if a licensee is authorized to prescribe drugs.  The board may, in its discretion, waive requirements for continuing education for a licensee if the licensee can demonstrate a hardship, including, but not limited to, a disability, military service or deployment, or other good cause.  Moreover, the bill reinstates a licensed midwife as a member of the State Board of Medical Examiners.
