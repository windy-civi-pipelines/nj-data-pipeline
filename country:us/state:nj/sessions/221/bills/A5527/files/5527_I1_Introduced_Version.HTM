<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  <span
style='color:black'>P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ) (pending before the Legislature
as this bill) </span>shall be known and may be cited as the Midwifery
Licensing Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The public interest
requires the establishment of a modern regulatory framework for the practice of
midwifery in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Midwives play a vital
role in improving maternal and infant health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Research has shown that
access to midwifery services significantly reduces the rate of maternal and
infant mortality and morbidity, particularly for vulnerable communities, yet
many of the statutory provisions governing the practice of midwifery in the
State date back to the late 19th century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Midwifery practice
continues to be regulated by the State Board of Medical Examiners rather than
by an independent midwifery licensing board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In light of the
expansion of midwifery practice and the urgent need to address New Jerseys
unusually high levels of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, it is
necessary to establish a new regulatory framework for the practice of midwifery
in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  As used

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill modifies current law
regulating midwives.  Specifically, the bill repeals the current law requiring
approval for licensure of midwives by the State Board of Medical Examiners and
establishes a State Board of Midwifery.  Under the bill, a board of 11 members,
seven of whom are to be midwives, is created to oversee the licensure of
certified midwives (CMs), certified nurse midwives (CNMs), and certified
professional midwives (CPMs). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      The bill:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      1)   delineates the
responsibilities of the board, which include the approval of licensure
applications, and recognition of entities accrediting midwifery certification
programs and national entities issuing the certifications;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      2)   reviews, as deemed
appropriate, the  continuing education hours completed by licensees based on
levels of certification;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      3)   requires applicants to
meet certain standards to qualify for a license; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      4)   authorizes the State
Board of Midwifery to grant individuals currently licensed as a CM, CNM, or CPM
by the State Board of Medical Examiners a license at that same level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      Under the bill, the
Department of Banking and Insurance is to require medical malpractice insurance
providers authorized to provide insurance in New Jersey to cover certified
professional midwives.  Additionally, health insurance carriers authorized to
provide coverage in the State are to cover home births if an individual is
approved to have a home birth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      The bill stipulates that
licensees are to complete continuing education credits in accordance with the
respective credentialing body for each level of certification, which is to
include at least one hour on implicit and explicit bias, and if a licensee is
authorized to prescribe drugs.  The board may, in its discretion, waive
requirements for continuing education for a licensee if the licensee can
demonstrate a hardship, including, but not limited to, a disability, military
service or deployment, or other good cause.  Moreover, the bill reinstates a
licensed midwife as a member of the State Board of Medical Examiners.</p>
