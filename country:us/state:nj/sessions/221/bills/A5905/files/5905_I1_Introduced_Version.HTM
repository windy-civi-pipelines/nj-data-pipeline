determination by the State Parole Board that an inmate shall be released on
parole, the parole board shall conduct a search of the domestic violence
central registry, established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999, c.421
(C.2C:25-34), to determine whether the inmate is the subject of a temporary or
final restraining order issued pursuant to the &quot;Prevention of Domestic Violence
Act of 1991,&quot; P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.).  If the search reveals
that the inmate is the subject of a temporary or final restraining order, the parole
board shall immediately notify the Administrative Office of the Courts so that
the persons status as a parolee may be reflected in the domestic violence central
registry.  The parole board also shall notify the Administrative Office of the
Courts when the term of parole supervision has terminated so that the registry
may be updated to reflect that change.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the Judiciary
and law enforcement to notify the State Parole Board when a parolee violates a
domestic violence restraining order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law does not establish
procedures for notifying the State Parole Board (SPB) when a parolee is charged
with violating a domestic violence restraining order.  This bill establishes
procedures for reflecting a persons status as a parolee in the domestic
violence central registry, and requires the Judiciary and law enforcement
agency to notify the SPB when a parolee is charged with a violation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) is required to maintain a domestic
violence central registry of any person who has had a domestic violence
restraining order entered against them, who has been charged with a crime or
offense involving domestic violence, and who has been charged with a violation
of a court order involving domestic violence. Under the bill, the registry is
required to also reflect if a person in the registry is a person who is
currently serving a sentence of parole supervision.  The bill further authorizes
the SPB to access the registry to determine if a parolee is the subject of a
domestic violence restraining order or has been charged with a violation of a
court order involving domestic violence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill requires
the SPB to notify the AOC so that the AOC may update the registry to reflect
that a person in the registry is currently serving a term of parole
supervision. The SPB is required to notify the AOC when the term of parole
supervision has terminated. To facilitate this notification process, the SPB
also is required to indicate in the report, which is required to be filed with
the board panel prior to an inmates parole eligibility date, whether the
person is the subject of a domestic violence restraining order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, when a person
is charged with violating a domestic violence restraining order, the law
enforcement agency or prosecutor, and the Judiciary are required to notify the
SPB that a parolee has violated an order. </p>
