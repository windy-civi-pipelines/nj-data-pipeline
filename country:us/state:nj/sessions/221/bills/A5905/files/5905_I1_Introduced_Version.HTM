All records made pursuant to this section shall be kept confidential and shall be released only to: a.     A public agency authorized to investigate a report of domestic violence; b.    A county prosecutor, or police or other law enforcement agency investigating a report of domestic violence, including determining whether a person charged with violating a temporary or final restraining order is currently serving a sentence of parole supervision, or conducting a background investigation involving a person's application for a firearm permit or employment as a police or law enforcement officer, or for any other purpose authorized by law or the Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey; c.     A court, upon its finding that access to such records may be necessary for determination of an issue before the court; d.    A surrogate, in that person's official capacity as deputy clerk of the Superior Court, in order to prepare documents that may be necessary for a court to determine an issue in an adoption proceeding; [or] e.     The Division of Child Protection and Permanency in the Department of Children and Families when the division is conducting a background investigation involving: (1)   an allegation of child abuse or neglect, to include any adult member of the same household as the individual who is the subject of the abuse or neglect allegation; or (2)   an out-of-home placement for a child being placed by the Division of Child Protection and Permanency, to include any adult member of the prospective placement household ; or f.     The State Parole Board for the purpose of determining whether a parolee is the subject of a domestic violence restraining order, or has been charged with a violation of a court order involving domestic violence. Any individual, agency, surrogate, or court which receives from the Administrative Office of the Courts the records referred to in this section shall keep the records and reports, or parts thereof, confidential and shall not disseminate or disclose such records and reports, or parts thereof; provided that nothing in this section shall prohibit a receiving individual, agency, surrogate or court from disclosing records and reports, or parts thereof, in a manner consistent with and in furtherance of the purpose for which the records and reports or parts thereof were received. Any individual who disseminates or discloses a record or report, or parts thereof, of the central registry, for a purpose other than investigating a report of domestic violence, conducting a background investigation involving a person's application for a firearm permit or employment as a police or law enforcement officer, making a determination of an issue before the court, conducting a background investigation as specified in subsection e. of this section, or for any other purpose other than that which is authorized by law or the Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey, shall be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. (cf: P.L.2012, c.16, s.9) 4.    Section 10 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.54) is amended to read as follows: 10. a. At least 120 days but not more than 180 days prior to the parole eligibility date of each adult inmate, a report concerning the inmate shall be filed with the appropriate board panel, by the staff members designated by the superintendent or other chief executive officer of the institution in which the inmate is held. b. (1) The report filed pursuant to subsection a. shall contain preincarceration records of the inmate, including any history of civil commitment, any disposition which arose out of any charges suspended pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-6 including records of the disposition of those charges and any acquittals by reason of insanity pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-1, state the conduct of the inmate during the current period of confinement, include a complete report on the inmate's social and physical condition, include an investigation by the Division of Parole of the inmate's parole plans, and present information bearing upon the likelihood that the inmate will commit a crime under the laws of this State if released on parole. The report shall also include a complete psychological evaluation of the inmate in any case in which the inmate was convicted of a first or second degree crime involving violence and: (a)   the inmate has a prior acquittal by reason of insanity pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-1 or had charges suspended pursuant to N.J.S.2C:4-6; or (b)   the inmate has a prior conviction for murder pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-3, aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-2, kidnapping pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-1, endangering the welfare of a child which would constitute a crime of the second degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-4, or stalking which would constitute a crime of the third degree pursuant to P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10); or (c)   the inmate has a prior diagnosis of psychosis.

(2)   At the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall notify any victim injured as a result of a crime of the first or second degree or the nearest relative of a murder victim of the opportunity to present a written or videotaped statement for the parole report to be considered at the parole hearing or to testify to the parole board concerning his harm at the time of the parole hearing.  Each victim or relative shall be responsible for notifying the board of his intention to submit such a statement and to provide an appropriate mailing address. The report may include a written or videotaped statement concerning the continuing nature and extent of any physical harm or psychological or emotional harm or trauma suffered by the victim, the extent of any loss of earnings or ability to work suffered by the victim and the continuing effect of the crime upon the victim's family.  At the time public notice is given that an inmate is being considered for parole pursuant to this section, the board shall also notify any victim or nearest relative who has previously contacted the board of the availability to provide a written or videotaped statement for inclusion in the parole report or to present testimony at the parole hearing. The board shall notify the victim or relative at the victim's or relative's last known mailing address. (3)   If the inmate meets the requirements for administrative parole release pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2019, c.364 (C.30:4-123.55d) the report shall indicate this eligibility. (4) If the inmate is the subject of a temporary or final restraining order issued pursuant to the "Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991," P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.), the report shall reflect that the inmate is subject to such an order. c.     A copy of the report filed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, excepting those documents which have been classified as confidential pursuant to rules and regulations of the board or the Department of Corrections, shall be served on the inmate at the time it is filed with the board panel.  The inmate may file with the board panel a written statement regarding the report, but shall do so within 105 days prior to the primary parole eligibility date. d.    Upon receipt of the public notice pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.45), a county prosecutor, a public defender, or a private attorney of record may request from the parole board a copy of the report on any adult inmate prepared pursuant to subsection a. of this section, which shall be expeditiously forwarded to the county prosecutor by the parole board by mail, courier, or other means of delivery.  Upon receipt of the report, the prosecutor has 10 working days to review the report and notify the parole board of the prosecutor's comments, if any, or notify the parole board of the prosecutor's intent to provide comments.  If the county prosecutor does not provide comments or notify the parole board of the prosecutor's intent to provide comments within the 10 working days, the parole board may presume that the prosecutor does not wish to provide comments and may proceed with the parole consideration.  Any comments provided by a county prosecutor shall be delivered to the parole board by the same method by which the county prosecutor received the report.  The confidentiality of the contents in a report which are classified as confidential shall be maintained and shall not be disclosed to any person who is not authorized to receive or review a copy of the report containing the confidential information. e.     Any provision of this section to the contrary notwithstanding, the board shall by rule or regulation modify the scope of the required reports and time periods for rendering such reports with reference to county penal institutions. f.     Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the board may modify the time periods for submitting the reports required pursuant to this section in processing an inmate whose parole eligibility date is accelerated pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.55). (cf: P.L.2019, c.364, s.9) 5. (New section) Upon a determination by the State Parole Board that an inmate shall be released on parole, the parole board shall conduct a search of the domestic violence central registry, established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999, c.421 (C.2C:25-34), to determine whether the inmate is the subject of a temporary or final restraining order issued pursuant to the "Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991," P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.).  If the search reveals that the inmate is the subject of a temporary or final restraining order, the parole board shall immediately notify the Administrative Office of the Courts so that the persons status as a parolee may be reflected in the domestic violence central registry.  The parole board also shall notify the Administrative Office of the Courts when the term of parole supervision has terminated so that the registry may be updated to reflect that change. 6.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the second month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires the Judiciary and law enforcement to notify the State Parole Board when a parolee violates a domestic violence restraining order. Current law does not establish procedures for notifying the State Parole Board (SPB) when a parolee is charged with violating a domestic violence restraining order.  This bill establishes procedures for reflecting a persons status as a parolee in the domestic violence central registry, and requires the Judiciary and law enforcement agency to notify the SPB when a parolee is charged with a violation. Under current law, the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) is required to maintain a domestic violence central registry of any person who has had a domestic violence restraining order entered against them, who has been charged with a crime or offense involving domestic violence, and who has been charged with a violation of a court order involving domestic violence. Under the bill, the registry is required to also reflect if a person in the registry is a person who is currently serving a sentence of parole supervision.  The bill further authorizes the SPB to access the registry to determine if a parolee is the subject of a domestic violence restraining order or has been charged with a violation of a court order involving domestic violence. In addition, the bill requires the SPB to notify the AOC so that the AOC may update the registry to reflect that a person in the registry is currently serving a term of parole supervision. The SPB is required to notify the AOC when the term of parole supervision has terminated. To facilitate this notification process, the SPB also is required to indicate in the report, which is required to be filed with the board panel prior to an inmates parole eligibility date, whether the person is the subject of a domestic violence restraining order. Under the bill, when a person is charged with violating a domestic violence restraining order, the law enforcement agency or prosecutor, and the Judiciary are required to notify the SPB that a parolee has violated an order.

(cf: P.L.2019, c.364, s.9) 5. (New section) Upon a determination by the State Parole Board that an inmate shall be released on parole, the parole board shall conduct a search of the domestic violence central registry, established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999, c.421 (C.2C:25-34), to determine whether the inmate is the subject of a temporary or final restraining order issued pursuant to the "Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991," P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.).  If the search reveals that the inmate is the subject of a temporary or final restraining order, the parole board shall immediately notify the Administrative Office of the Courts so that the persons status as a parolee may be reflected in the domestic violence central registry.  The parole board also shall notify the Administrative Office of the Courts when the term of parole supervision has terminated so that the registry may be updated to reflect that change. 6.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the second month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires the Judiciary and law enforcement to notify the State Parole Board when a parolee violates a domestic violence restraining order. Current law does not establish procedures for notifying the State Parole Board (SPB) when a parolee is charged with violating a domestic violence restraining order.  This bill establishes procedures for reflecting a persons status as a parolee in the domestic violence central registry, and requires the Judiciary and law enforcement agency to notify the SPB when a parolee is charged with a violation. Under current law, the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) is required to maintain a domestic violence central registry of any person who has had a domestic violence restraining order entered against them, who has been charged with a crime or offense involving domestic violence, and who has been charged with a violation of a court order involving domestic violence. Under the bill, the registry is required to also reflect if a person in the registry is a person who is currently serving a sentence of parole supervision.  The bill further authorizes the SPB to access the registry to determine if a parolee is the subject of a domestic violence restraining order or has been charged with a violation of a court order involving domestic violence. In addition, the bill requires the SPB to notify the AOC so that the AOC may update the registry to reflect that a person in the registry is currently serving a term of parole supervision. The SPB is required to notify the AOC when the term of parole supervision has terminated. To facilitate this notification process, the SPB also is required to indicate in the report, which is required to be filed with the board panel prior to an inmates parole eligibility date, whether the person is the subject of a domestic violence restraining order. Under the bill, when a person is charged with violating a domestic violence restraining order, the law enforcement agency or prosecutor, and the Judiciary are required to notify the SPB that a parolee has violated an order.
