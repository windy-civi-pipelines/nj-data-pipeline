Instead, this bill would require that within one year of the date that a final judgment of foreclosure is entered vesting title to the property in the lienholder, the premium payment is to be deposited with the court and paid, upon application therefor, to the person against whom a judgment in foreclosure has been recovered.  If no application is made within one year of the premium being deposited with the court, upon application to the court by the chief financial officer of the municipality in which the property is located, the premium will be turned over to the chief financial officer and become part of the funds of the municipality.  The bill would also require that in the event that a property is required to be sold at a sheriffs sale, the premium is to be refunded to the holder of the tax lien if the property is sold to a third party within five years from the date of sale.
