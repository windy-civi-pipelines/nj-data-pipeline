STATEMENT This resolution urges the President of the United States and the Secretary of the Treasury to place the likeness of Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill without delay.  Currently, plans to place Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill have been delayed until at least 2026. Harriet Tubman remains one of the most famous women in American History. Through her work as a conductor on the Underground Railroad, as a scout and spy for the Union Army, and as a supporter of womens suffrage, Tubman dedicated herself to the cause of freedom and equality for all individuals regardless of race or gender.  Given the extraordinary life she led, this House believes Harriet Tubman is worthy of being depicted on this nations currency and efforts to place her likeness on the $20 bill should be done without delay.
