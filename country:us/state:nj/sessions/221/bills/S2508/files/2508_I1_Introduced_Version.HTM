seq.), amending P.L.1975, c.217, and making an appropriation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b> <i>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  Sections
1, 2, 6 through 9, 11, 14 through 16 and 19 through 22 shall be known and may
be cited as the &quot;Municipal Development Impact Fee Authorization Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Over the past number of
years, the State of New Jersey has experienced unprecedented economic growth
which has resulted in substantial building and development activity throughout
the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    While the building boom
of the 1980's was a positive phenomenon to the extent that it was associated
with the growth of jobs and a higher standard of living, the rapid rate of
development in those years also created major public policy challenges, in
particular, upgrading the existing infrastructure to support that growth and
allow for future development;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Of the considerable
impacts associated with new development, the burden it places on an older, and
often inadequate infrastructure is one which the Legislature views with
particular concern in light of the potential dangers associated with
deteriorating water supply facilities and sewer systems and the pressure which
that development places on a long-neglected road network which already handles
dangerously high levels of traffic;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The burden placed on
older and often inadequate public school facilities is also one which the
Legislature views with particular concern.  The increased number of students
generated by new development has a considerable impact on the ability of local
school districts to provide a thorough and efficient education for their
students; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     It is therefore a valid
public policy of the State and in the public interest that municipalities be
enabled to levy impact fees on new development in order to make those
improvements in the local infrastructure or to build new or expand existing
school facilities which are necessary to accommodate the new development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Section 3 of P.L.1975,
c.291 (C.40:55D-3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    For the purposes of this
act, unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The term &quot;shall&quot;
indicates a mandatory requirement, and the term &quot;may&quot; indicates a
permissive action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Administrative
officer&quot; means the clerk of the municipality, unless a different municipal
official or officials are designated by ordinance or statute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Agricultural
restriction&quot; means an &quot;agricultural deed restriction for farmland
preservation purposes&quot; as defined in section 3 of P.L.1983, c.32
(C.4:1C-13).</p>

means &quot;farmland&quot; as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1999, c.152
(C.13:8C-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Applicant&quot; means a
developer submitting an application for development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Application for
development&quot; means the application form and all accompanying documents
required by ordinance for approval of a subdivision plat, site plan, planned

of the issuance of a permit pursuant to section 25 or section 27 of P.L.1975,
c.291 (C.40:55D-34 or C.40:55D-36).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, known as the
&quot;Municipal Development Impact Fee Authorization Act,&quot; would allow
municipalities to impose an impact fee on developers under certain
circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A municipality which imposes
an impact fee must do so by an ordinance which sets forth detailed standards
and guidelines regarding the definition of a service unit and the specific
purposes for which the impact fee revenues may be expended.  The impact fee
ordinance shall also contain a delineation of service areas for each capital
improvement and a fee schedule which clearly sets forth the amount of the fee
to be charged for each service unit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Municipalities may impose an
impact fee to cover a broad range of expenditure areas, including any
transportation improvement necessitated by new development in a county not
covered by a transportation development district created pursuant to the
&quot;New Jersey Transportation Development District Act of 1989,&quot; water
treatment and distribution, wastewater treatment and sewerage, flood control
and stormwater management, educational facilities, municipal parks and
recreation facilities, public safety and related facilities.  The bill exempts
low and moderate income housing units as defined under P.L.1985, c.222
(C.52:27D-301 et al.) from the assessment of impact fees and prohibits the internal
subsidy within inclusionary developments which would otherwise see purchasers
of market-priced units absorb the impact fees forgiven on their affordable
counterparts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Capital improvements and
facility expansion for which an impact fee is imposed must bear a reasonable
relationship to needs created by the new development.  A municipality may adopt
such an impact fee ordinance only if it has previously adopted a capital
improvement program and has a valid master plan in place.  The capital
improvement program referred to here is more detailed than that which is
currently authorized under section 20 of the &quot;Municipal Land Use
Law,&quot; P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-29).  An impact fee imposed to finance
educational facilities shall be based upon a long-term facilities plan approved
by the Commissioner of Education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Municipalities which choose
not to implement an impact fee ordinance under this bill may continue to
prepare the less comprehensive capital improvement program currently authorized
under the &quot;Municipal Land Use Law.&quot;  Similarly, those municipalities
may continue to levy a fee for off-tract improvements authorized under section
30 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-42).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill sets forth terms and
conditions under which municipalities may assess and hold onto impact fee
revenues.  Fifty percent of the amount assessed as an impact fee shall be paid
prior to the issuance of a construction permit and the remainder, prior to the
issuance of the certificate of occupancy.  No impact fee imposed by a
municipality shall exceed the development's proportional share of the current
reasonable cost of constructing the capital improvement or facility expansion
for which the fee is being assessed.  In no case shall the municipality
maintain unexpended impact fees for more than eight years after the date of
collection of the final payment for any development, unless construction has
already begun on the capital improvement of facility expansion for which the
impact fees were collected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides for an
appeal of an impact fee assessment to an administrative law judge under the
&quot;Administrative Procedure Act&quot; as a contested case; unlike decisions
of contested cases under the APA, however, decisions of an administrative law
judge in these cases would be final and would be appealable directly to the
Appellate Division of Superior Court.</p>
