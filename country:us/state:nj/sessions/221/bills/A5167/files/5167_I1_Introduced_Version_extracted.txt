AI for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Consultancy Program Lastly, the bill also establishes the AI for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Consultancy Program, which would be administered by the authority, in consultation with the New Jersey Chief Technology Officer. Under the program, the authority would provide consultancy services and technical assistance to small and medium-sized businesses, upon application to the authority, in identifying and implementing the artificial intelligence technologies and tools that support the business development and growth plan identified in the businesss application to the program. The program would be administered by a manager, appointed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Authority, qualified by work in artificial intelligence development activities or its equivalent in training and experience.  As part of the program managers duties, the person would establish and update, as necessary, a database listing the availability of qualified artificial intelligence professionals, businesses, research institutions, industry networks, academic networks, technologies, and tools in the State.  The database would be published and maintained on the official Internet website of the authority. The bill appropriates $500,000 from the General Fund to the authority for the purposes of establishing and administering the AI for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Consultancy Program.
