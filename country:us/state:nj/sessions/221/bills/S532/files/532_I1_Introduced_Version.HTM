reasonable cost.  </p>

would provide, (b) the proportion of affordable units to the total number of
units envisaged in the project plan, (c) the distribution of those affordable
units as between those affordable to persons and families of low income and
those of moderate income, considered in relation to the needs of the housing
region, (d) appropriateness of the proposed tenure of the affordable units,
whether to be rental or owner-occupied, in relation to the needs of the housing
region, and (e) appropriateness of the proposed distribution of units as to
family size, in relation to the needs of the housing region.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Efficiency.  Each project
shall be evaluated on the basis of the cost to the State, in terms of financial
assistance granted or revenue forgone in order to further the project, for each

desirable according to the terms of the proposal or application made for such
assistance.  </p>
