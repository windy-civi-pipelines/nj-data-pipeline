For the purposes of this section, a day in session means a day on which the school is open, students are under the guidance and direction of a teacher engaged in the teaching process, and is not less than six hours; except that the six-hour requirement shall not be applicable to a school that enrolls only kindergarten students.

Under current State Board of Education regulations at N.J.A.C.6A:32-8.3(b), a school day consists of not less than four hours.
