Pursuant to current law, pharmacy benefits managers interacting with covered persons have the same duty to the covered persons as the health benefits plan or carrier for whom it is performing pharmacy benefits management services.  Pursuant to the bill, that duty would continue, but pharmacy benefits managers would have an additional fiduciary duty to the financial interests of covered persons.  In this context, fiduciary duty means that the pharmacy benefits manager must prioritize the financial interests of covered persons above the interests of the health insurance carrier with which it contracts.
