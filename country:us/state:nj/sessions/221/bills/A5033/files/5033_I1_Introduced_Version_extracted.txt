STATEMENT This bill enables the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development to establish public-private partnerships to develop and advance AI workforce training.  The training will have a dual purpose of retraining workers displaced by AI and providing training in AI skills for active workers to enable the workforce to remain competitive in evolving AI technology. The public-private partnerships will enable the private entity to assume full financial and administrative responsibility for the development of training and retraining services related to AI in exchange for not being subject to certain procurement and prevailing wage criteria. The department will establish methods of publicizing the program, establish criteria for evaluating the proposals, and define the various administrative requirements.  In addition, the department will establish an advisory council to provide targeted feedback on the progress of the program and insight on how that training can be improved.
