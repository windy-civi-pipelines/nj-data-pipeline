If the heir or legatee of the firearm does not qualify to possess or carry it, [he] the heir or legatee may retain ownership of the firearm for the purpose of sale for a period not exceeding 180 days, or for a further limited period as may be approved by the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality in which the heir or legatee resides or the superintendent, provided that the firearm is in the custody of the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality or the superintendent during that period. k.    Sawed-off shotguns.

STATEMENT This bill prohibits a person convicted of any crime or offense constituting animal cruelty from possessing a firearm and from being issued a firearms purchaser identification card or a permit to purchase a handgun. Current law provides that a person who is convicted of certain crimes is prohibited from purchasing, owning, possessing, or controlling a firearm.  These offenses include, but are not limited to, aggravated assault, arson, burglary, homicide, robbery, aggravated sexual assault, and certain animal cruelty crimes, such as dog fighting, harming or killing a law enforcement animal, and harming or killing a service animal or guide dog.  The bill provides that a person who has been convicted of any animal cruelty offense also would be prohibited from possessing a firearm.  Under the bill, an animal cruelty offense includes various acts constituting animal cruelty such as animal abuse, as set forth in chapter 22 of Title 4 of the Revised Statutes.  A violation of the bills provisions would be a fourth degree crime.  Fourth degree crimes are punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. Additionally, the bill disqualifies a person who has been convicted of an animal cruelty offense from being issued a firearms purchaser identification card or a permit to purchase a handgun.

STATEMENT This bill prohibits a person convicted of any crime or offense constituting animal cruelty from possessing a firearm and from being issued a firearms purchaser identification card or a permit to purchase a handgun. Current law provides that a person who is convicted of certain crimes is prohibited from purchasing, owning, possessing, or controlling a firearm.  These offenses include, but are not limited to, aggravated assault, arson, burglary, homicide, robbery, aggravated sexual assault, and certain animal cruelty crimes, such as dog fighting, harming or killing a law enforcement animal, and harming or killing a service animal or guide dog.  The bill provides that a person who has been convicted of any animal cruelty offense also would be prohibited from possessing a firearm.  Under the bill, an animal cruelty offense includes various acts constituting animal cruelty such as animal abuse, as set forth in chapter 22 of Title 4 of the Revised Statutes.  A violation of the bills provisions would be a fourth degree crime.  Fourth degree crimes are punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. Additionally, the bill disqualifies a person who has been convicted of an animal cruelty offense from being issued a firearms purchaser identification card or a permit to purchase a handgun.
