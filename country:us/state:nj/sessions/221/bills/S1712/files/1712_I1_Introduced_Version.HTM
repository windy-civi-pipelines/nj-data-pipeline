The actual cost of duplicating the record shall be the cost of materials and supplies used to make a copy of the record, but shall not include the cost of labor or other overhead expenses associated with making the copy except as provided for in subsection c. of this section.  If a public agency can demonstrate that its actual costs for duplication of a government record exceed the foregoing rates, the public agency shall be permitted to charge the actual cost of duplicating the record. If the government record is readily available on the public agency website, the custodian may require the requester to obtain the record from the agency website. c.     Whenever the nature, format, manner of collation, or volume of a government record embodied in the form of printed matter to be inspected, examined, or copied pursuant to this section is such that the record cannot be reproduced by ordinary document copying equipment in ordinary business size or involves an extraordinary expenditure of time and effort to accommodate the request, the public agency may charge, in addition to the actual cost of duplicating the record, a special service charge that shall be reasonable and shall be based upon the actual direct cost of providing the copy or copies, or for the labor cost of personnel providing the service, that is actually incurred by the agency or attributable to the agency for the programming, clerical, and supervisory assistance required, or both; provided, however, that in the case of a municipality, rates for the duplication of particular records when the actual cost of copying exceeds the foregoing rates shall be established in advance by ordinance.  The requestor shall have the opportunity to review and object to the charge prior to it being incurred. d.    A custodian shall permit access to a government record and provide a copy thereof in the medium requested if the public agency maintains the record in that medium.  If the public agency does not maintain the record in the medium requested, the custodian shall either convert the record to the medium requested or provide a copy in some other meaningful medium.  If a request is for a record: (1) in a medium not routinely used by the agency; (2) not routinely developed or maintained by an agency; or (3) requiring a substantial amount of manipulation or programming of information technology, the agency may charge, in addition to the actual cost of duplication, a special charge that shall be reasonable and shall be based on the cost for any extensive use of information technology, or for the labor cost of personnel providing the service, that is actually incurred by the agency or attributable to the agency for the programming, clerical, and supervisory assistance required, or both. e.     Immediate access ordinarily shall be granted to budgets, bills, vouchers, contracts, including collective negotiations agreements and individual employment contracts, and public employee salary and overtime information. f.     The custodian of a public agency shall adopt a form for the use of any person who requests access to a government record held or controlled by the public agency.  The form shall provide space for the name, address, and phone number of the requestor and a brief description of the government record sought.  The form shall include space for the custodian to indicate which record will be made available, when the record will be available, and the fees to be charged.  The form shall also include the following: (1) specific directions and procedures for requesting a record; (2) a statement as to whether prepayment of fees or a deposit is required; (3) the time period within which the public agency is required by P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, to make the record available; (4) a statement of the requestor's right to challenge a decision by the public agency to deny access and the procedure for filing an appeal; (5) space for the custodian to list reasons if a request is denied in whole or in part; (6) space for the requestor to sign and date the form; (7) space for the custodian to sign and date the form if the request is fulfilled or denied. If a request for information is made in writing on a document other than the form adopted by the public agency and the request contains the requisite information prescribed in this subsection, the custodian shall treat the request as if made on the form adopted by the public agency.  The request made on a document other than the form adopted by the public agency shall clearly and conspicuously state that the request is a records request made under the provisions of the open public records act of this State. The custodian may require a deposit against costs for reproducing documents sought through an anonymous request whenever the custodian anticipates that the information thus requested will cost in excess of $5 to reproduce. g.    A request for access to a government record shall be in writing and hand-delivered, mailed, transmitted electronically, or otherwise conveyed to the appropriate custodian.  A custodian shall promptly comply with a request to inspect, examine, copy, or provide a copy of a government record.  If the custodian is unable to comply with a request for access, the custodian shall indicate the specific basis therefor on the request form and promptly return it to the requestor.  The custodian shall sign and date the form and provide the requestor with a copy thereof.  If the custodian of a government record asserts that part of a particular record is exempt from public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, the custodian shall delete or excise from a copy of the record that portion which the custodian asserts is exempt from access and shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the record.  If the government record requested is temporarily unavailable because it is in use or in storage, the custodian shall so advise the requestor and shall make arrangements to promptly make available a copy of the record.  If a request for access to a government record would substantially disrupt agency operations, the custodian may deny access to the record after attempting to reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that accommodates the interests of the requestor and the agency. h.    Any officer or employee of a public agency who receives a request for access to a government record shall forward the request to the custodian of the record or direct the requestor to the custodian of the record. i.     Unless a shorter time period is otherwise provided by statute, regulation, or executive order, a custodian of a government record shall grant access to a government record or deny a request for access to a government record as soon as possible, but not later than seven business days after receiving the request, provided that the record is currently available and not in storage or archived.  In the event that the record is not currently available or the request is voluminous in nature, or involves an extraordinary expenditure of time and effort to accommodate the request, the public agency shall have an extension of no more than seven business days to produce the record.  In the event a custodian fails to respond within seven business days, or fourteen business days when appropriate, after receiving a request, the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the requestor has elected not to provide a name, address or telephone number, or other means of contacting the requestor.  If the requestor has elected not to provide a name, address, or telephone number, or other means of contacting the requestor, the custodian shall not be required to respond until the requestor reappears before the custodian seeking a response to the original request.  If the government record is in storage or archived, the requestor shall be so advised within seven business days after the custodian receives the request.  The requestor shall be advised by the custodian when the record can be made available.  If the record is not made available by that time, access shall be deemed denied.  If the requestor does not pick up the records within fourteen business days of the records being available, the request shall be considered fulfilled.  If the requestor will not be available to pick up the records within that time, the requestor shall notify the custodian when the records will be picked up, but at not time, shall the custodian be required to maintain the records beyond thirty calendar days. j.     A custodian shall post prominently in public view in the part or parts of the office or offices of the custodian that are open to or frequented by the public a statement that sets forth in clear, concise and specific terms the right to appeal a denial of, or failure to provide, access to a government record by any person for inspection, examination, or copying or for purchase of copies thereof and the procedure by which an appeal may be filed. The custodian of a public agency that has a website shall, at a minimum, prominently post on the website the name, electronic mail address, phone number, and facsimile number for the custodian of records. k.    The files maintained by the Office of the Public Defender that relate to the handling of any case shall be considered confidential and shall not be open to inspection by any person unless authorized by law, court order, or the State Public Defender. (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.6) 3.    Section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6) is amended to read as follows: 7.    A person who is denied access to a government record by the custodian of the record, at the option of the requestor, may: institute a proceeding to challenge the custodian's decision by filing an action in Superior Court which shall be heard in the vicinage where it is filed by a Superior Court Judge who has been designated to hear such cases because of that judge's knowledge and expertise in matters relating to access to government records; or in lieu of filing an action in Superior Court, file a complaint with the Government Records Council established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7). The right to institute any proceeding under this section shall be solely that of the requestor.  Any such proceeding shall proceed in a summary or expedited manner. The public agency shall have the burden of proving that the denial of access is authorized by law.  If it is determined that access has been improperly denied, the court or agency head shall order that access be allowed.  A requestor who prevails in any proceeding shall be entitled to a reasonable attorney's fee. When the award of attorneys fees is being considered, the award shall only be made in the case of a knowing and willful violation. (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.7) 4.    Section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7) is amended to read as follows: 8.    a.  There is established in the Department of Community Affairs a Government Records Council.  The council shall consist of the Commissioner of Community Affairs or the commissioner's designee, the Commissioner of Education or the commissioner's designee, and three public members appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, not more than two of whom shall be of the same political party.  The three public members shall serve during the term of the Governor making the appointment and until the appointment of a successor.  A public member shall not hold any other State or local elected or appointed office or employment while serving as a member of the council.  A public member shall not receive a salary for service on the council but shall be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary expenses associated with serving on the council and may receive such per diem payment as may be provided in the annual appropriations act.  A member may be removed by the Governor for cause. Vacancies among the public members shall be filled in the same manner in which the original appointment was made.  The members of the council shall choose one of the public members to serve as the council's chair.  The council may employ an executive director and such professional and clerical staff as it deems necessary and may call upon the Department of Community Affairs for such assistance as it deems necessary and may be available to it. b.    The Government Records Council shall: establish an informal mediation program to facilitate the resolution of disputes regarding access to government records; receive, hear, review and adjudicate a complaint filed by any person concerning a denial of access to a government record by a records custodian; issue advisory opinions, on its own initiative, as to whether a particular type of record is a government record which is accessible to the public; prepare guidelines and an informational pamphlet for use by records custodians in complying with the law governing access to public records; prepare a form for use by records custodians that allows residents of the custodians municipality the option to opt-out of having their address disclosed as a public record; prepare an informational pamphlet explaining the public's right of access to government records and the methods for resolving disputes regarding access, which records custodians shall make available to persons requesting access to a government record; prepare lists for use by records custodians of the types of records in the possession of public agencies which are government records; make training opportunities available for records custodians and other public officers and employees which explain the law governing access to public records; and operate an informational website and a toll-free helpline staffed by knowledgeable employees of the council during regular business hours which shall enable any person, including records custodians, to call for information regarding the law governing access to public records and allow any person to request mediation or to file a complaint with the council when access has been denied; In implementing the provisions of subsections d. and e. of this section, the council shall: act, to the maximum extent possible, at the convenience of the parties; utilize teleconferencing, faxing of documents, e-mail and similar forms of modern communication; and when in-person meetings are necessary, send representatives to meet with the parties at a location convenient to the parties. c.     At the request of the council, a public agency shall produce documents and ensure the attendance of witnesses with respect to the council's investigation of any complaint or the holding of any hearing. d.    Upon receipt of a written complaint signed by any person alleging that a custodian of a government record has improperly denied that person access to a government record, the council shall [offer] require the parties [the opportunity] to attempt to resolve the dispute through mediation.  Mediation shall enable a person who has been denied access to a government record and the custodian who denied or failed to provide access thereto to attempt to mediate the dispute through a process whereby a neutral mediator, who shall be trained in mediation selected by the council, acts to encourage and facilitate the resolution of the dispute.  Mediation shall be an informal, nonadversarial process having the objective of helping the parties reach a mutually acceptable, voluntary agreement.  The mediator shall assist the parties in identifying issues, foster joint problem solving, and explore settlement alternatives. e.     If [any party declines mediation or if] mediation fails to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of all parties, the council shall initiate an investigation concerning the facts and circumstances set forth in the complaint.  The council shall make a determination as to whether the complaint is within its jurisdiction or frivolous or without any reasonable factual basis.  If the council shall conclude that the complaint is outside its jurisdiction, frivolous or without factual basis, it shall reduce that conclusion to writing and transmit a copy thereof to the complainant and to the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed.  Otherwise, the council shall notify the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed of the nature of the complaint and the facts and circumstances set forth therein. The custodian shall have the opportunity to present the board with any statement or information concerning the complaint which the custodian wishes. If the council is able to make a determination as to a record's accessibility based upon the complaint and the custodian's response thereto, it shall reduce that conclusion to writing and transmit a copy thereof to the complainant and to the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed. If the council is unable to make a determination as to a record's accessibility based upon the complaint and the custodian's response thereto, the council shall conduct a hearing on the matter in conformity with the rules and regulations provided for hearings by a State agency in contested cases under the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), insofar as they may be applicable and practicable.  The council shall, by a majority vote of its members, render a decision as to whether the record which is the subject of the complaint is a government record which must be made available for public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented.  If the council determines, by a majority vote of its members, that a custodian has knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), as amended and supplemented, and is found to have unreasonably denied access under the totality of the circumstances, the council may impose the penalties provided for in section 12 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-11).  A decision of the council may be appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.  A decision of the council shall not have value as a precedent for any case initiated in Superior Court pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6). All proceedings of the council pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible. f.     The council shall not charge any party a fee in regard to actions filed with the council.  The council shall be subject to the provisions of the "Open Public Meetings Act," P.L.1975, c.231 (C.10:4-6), except that the council may go into closed session during that portion of any proceeding during which the contents of a contested record would be disclosed.  A requestor who prevails in any proceeding shall be entitled to a reasonable attorney's fee. g.    The council shall not have jurisdiction over the Judicial or Legislative Branches of State Government or any agency, officer, or employee of those branches. (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.8) 5.    (New section)  a.  Notwithstanding any other law or rule or regulation to the contrary, whenever it is made to appear by verified petition to the Superior Court of the county in which a requestor for government records under P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) resides or has a primary place of business, the court may issue a protective order limiting the number and scope of requests a requestor may make.  The court may issue the protective order if it determines that the requestor has sought records under P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) for an improper purpose, which includes, but is not limited to, the harassment of a public agency or its employees.  The petition shall be accompanied by a declaration of facts by the public agency withholding the records demonstrating that it has complied with P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) and has made a good faith effort to reach an informal resolution of the issues relating to the records request. b.    The order specified in subsection a. of this section may limit, or in appropriate circumstances, eliminate, the public agencys duty to respond to government records requests from the requestor in the future. c.     Upon entry of an order pursuant to this section, the order of the court shall be immediately reviewable by petition to the appellate court.  A party shall, in order to obtain review of the order, file a petition within 20 days after service upon him or her of a written notice of entry of the order, or within further time not exceeding an additional 20 days as the court may for good cause allow.  If the notice is served by mail, the period within which to file the petition shall be increased by five days.  A stay of an order or judgment shall not be granted unless the petitioning party demonstrates that it will otherwise sustain irreparable damage and probable success on the merits.  Any person who fails to obey the order of the court shall be cited to show cause why he or she is not in contempt of court. d.    For the purposes of this section, the county of residence shall include any address listed on the request for the government records. 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill makes certain changes to the publics access to government records.  Specifically the bill:  exempts from disclosure e-mail addresses, home telephone numbers, unlisted or otherwise and cell phone numbers;   provides for a uniform per page rate for copying government records;   requires the Government Records Council to develop a form to be used by records custodians that will allow persons to opt-out of having their address made public;  permits a records custodian to require the requester to obtain the record from the agency website when the information requested is readily available on the website;  clarifies special service charges includes costs of labor;   requires the record custodian to accept a record request made on a document other than the adopted form if it contains a notice that it is an OPRA request and contains the information required on the adopted form;  provides records custodians a seven day extension to comply with large or complicated requests;  requires the requestor to pick up the requested documents within fourteen business days of the records being available;  requires contact information for the custodian of a public agency to be included on the agency website;  requires mediation for all complaints; and  requires that attorneys fees be awarded only when a knowing and willful violation is found. Also, this bill will permit a Superior Court to issue a protective order limiting the number and scope of requests a requestor may make under the open public records act, N.J.S.A.47:1A-1 et seq.  In appropriate circumstances, the court may eliminate a public agencys duty to respond to requests from the requestor in the future.  The bill will require the court, in issuing the order, to determine that the requestor has sought records under the act for an improper purpose, including, but not limited to, the harassment of a public agency or its employees.

The actual cost of duplicating the record shall be the cost of materials and supplies used to make a copy of the record, but shall not include the cost of labor or other overhead expenses associated with making the copy except as provided for in subsection c. of this section.  If a public agency can demonstrate that its actual costs for duplication of a government record exceed the foregoing rates, the public agency shall be permitted to charge the actual cost of duplicating the record. If the government record is readily available on the public agency website, the custodian may require the requester to obtain the record from the agency website. c.     Whenever the nature, format, manner of collation, or volume of a government record embodied in the form of printed matter to be inspected, examined, or copied pursuant to this section is such that the record cannot be reproduced by ordinary document copying equipment in ordinary business size or involves an extraordinary expenditure of time and effort to accommodate the request, the public agency may charge, in addition to the actual cost of duplicating the record, a special service charge that shall be reasonable and shall be based upon the actual direct cost of providing the copy or copies, or for the labor cost of personnel providing the service, that is actually incurred by the agency or attributable to the agency for the programming, clerical, and supervisory assistance required, or both; provided, however, that in the case of a municipality, rates for the duplication of particular records when the actual cost of copying exceeds the foregoing rates shall be established in advance by ordinance.  The requestor shall have the opportunity to review and object to the charge prior to it being incurred. d.    A custodian shall permit access to a government record and provide a copy thereof in the medium requested if the public agency maintains the record in that medium.  If the public agency does not maintain the record in the medium requested, the custodian shall either convert the record to the medium requested or provide a copy in some other meaningful medium.  If a request is for a record: (1) in a medium not routinely used by the agency; (2) not routinely developed or maintained by an agency; or (3) requiring a substantial amount of manipulation or programming of information technology, the agency may charge, in addition to the actual cost of duplication, a special charge that shall be reasonable and shall be based on the cost for any extensive use of information technology, or for the labor cost of personnel providing the service, that is actually incurred by the agency or attributable to the agency for the programming, clerical, and supervisory assistance required, or both. e.     Immediate access ordinarily shall be granted to budgets, bills, vouchers, contracts, including collective negotiations agreements and individual employment contracts, and public employee salary and overtime information. f.     The custodian of a public agency shall adopt a form for the use of any person who requests access to a government record held or controlled by the public agency.  The form shall provide space for the name, address, and phone number of the requestor and a brief description of the government record sought.  The form shall include space for the custodian to indicate which record will be made available, when the record will be available, and the fees to be charged.  The form shall also include the following: (1) specific directions and procedures for requesting a record; (2) a statement as to whether prepayment of fees or a deposit is required; (3) the time period within which the public agency is required by P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, to make the record available; (4) a statement of the requestor's right to challenge a decision by the public agency to deny access and the procedure for filing an appeal; (5) space for the custodian to list reasons if a request is denied in whole or in part; (6) space for the requestor to sign and date the form; (7) space for the custodian to sign and date the form if the request is fulfilled or denied. If a request for information is made in writing on a document other than the form adopted by the public agency and the request contains the requisite information prescribed in this subsection, the custodian shall treat the request as if made on the form adopted by the public agency.  The request made on a document other than the form adopted by the public agency shall clearly and conspicuously state that the request is a records request made under the provisions of the open public records act of this State. The custodian may require a deposit against costs for reproducing documents sought through an anonymous request whenever the custodian anticipates that the information thus requested will cost in excess of $5 to reproduce. g.    A request for access to a government record shall be in writing and hand-delivered, mailed, transmitted electronically, or otherwise conveyed to the appropriate custodian.  A custodian shall promptly comply with a request to inspect, examine, copy, or provide a copy of a government record.  If the custodian is unable to comply with a request for access, the custodian shall indicate the specific basis therefor on the request form and promptly return it to the requestor.  The custodian shall sign and date the form and provide the requestor with a copy thereof.  If the custodian of a government record asserts that part of a particular record is exempt from public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, the custodian shall delete or excise from a copy of the record that portion which the custodian asserts is exempt from access and shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the record.  If the government record requested is temporarily unavailable because it is in use or in storage, the custodian shall so advise the requestor and shall make arrangements to promptly make available a copy of the record.  If a request for access to a government record would substantially disrupt agency operations, the custodian may deny access to the record after attempting to reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that accommodates the interests of the requestor and the agency. h.    Any officer or employee of a public agency who receives a request for access to a government record shall forward the request to the custodian of the record or direct the requestor to the custodian of the record. i.     Unless a shorter time period is otherwise provided by statute, regulation, or executive order, a custodian of a government record shall grant access to a government record or deny a request for access to a government record as soon as possible, but not later than seven business days after receiving the request, provided that the record is currently available and not in storage or archived.  In the event that the record is not currently available or the request is voluminous in nature, or involves an extraordinary expenditure of time and effort to accommodate the request, the public agency shall have an extension of no more than seven business days to produce the record.  In the event a custodian fails to respond within seven business days, or fourteen business days when appropriate, after receiving a request, the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the requestor has elected not to provide a name, address or telephone number, or other means of contacting the requestor.  If the requestor has elected not to provide a name, address, or telephone number, or other means of contacting the requestor, the custodian shall not be required to respond until the requestor reappears before the custodian seeking a response to the original request.  If the government record is in storage or archived, the requestor shall be so advised within seven business days after the custodian receives the request.  The requestor shall be advised by the custodian when the record can be made available.  If the record is not made available by that time, access shall be deemed denied.  If the requestor does not pick up the records within fourteen business days of the records being available, the request shall be considered fulfilled.  If the requestor will not be available to pick up the records within that time, the requestor shall notify the custodian when the records will be picked up, but at not time, shall the custodian be required to maintain the records beyond thirty calendar days. j.     A custodian shall post prominently in public view in the part or parts of the office or offices of the custodian that are open to or frequented by the public a statement that sets forth in clear, concise and specific terms the right to appeal a denial of, or failure to provide, access to a government record by any person for inspection, examination, or copying or for purchase of copies thereof and the procedure by which an appeal may be filed. The custodian of a public agency that has a website shall, at a minimum, prominently post on the website the name, electronic mail address, phone number, and facsimile number for the custodian of records. k.    The files maintained by the Office of the Public Defender that relate to the handling of any case shall be considered confidential and shall not be open to inspection by any person unless authorized by law, court order, or the State Public Defender. (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.6) 3.    Section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6) is amended to read as follows: 7.    A person who is denied access to a government record by the custodian of the record, at the option of the requestor, may: institute a proceeding to challenge the custodian's decision by filing an action in Superior Court which shall be heard in the vicinage where it is filed by a Superior Court Judge who has been designated to hear such cases because of that judge's knowledge and expertise in matters relating to access to government records; or in lieu of filing an action in Superior Court, file a complaint with the Government Records Council established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7). The right to institute any proceeding under this section shall be solely that of the requestor.  Any such proceeding shall proceed in a summary or expedited manner. The public agency shall have the burden of proving that the denial of access is authorized by law.  If it is determined that access has been improperly denied, the court or agency head shall order that access be allowed.  A requestor who prevails in any proceeding shall be entitled to a reasonable attorney's fee. When the award of attorneys fees is being considered, the award shall only be made in the case of a knowing and willful violation. (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.7) 4.    Section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7) is amended to read as follows: 8.    a.  There is established in the Department of Community Affairs a Government Records Council.  The council shall consist of the Commissioner of Community Affairs or the commissioner's designee, the Commissioner of Education or the commissioner's designee, and three public members appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, not more than two of whom shall be of the same political party.  The three public members shall serve during the term of the Governor making the appointment and until the appointment of a successor.  A public member shall not hold any other State or local elected or appointed office or employment while serving as a member of the council.  A public member shall not receive a salary for service on the council but shall be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary expenses associated with serving on the council and may receive such per diem payment as may be provided in the annual appropriations act.  A member may be removed by the Governor for cause. Vacancies among the public members shall be filled in the same manner in which the original appointment was made.  The members of the council shall choose one of the public members to serve as the council's chair.  The council may employ an executive director and such professional and clerical staff as it deems necessary and may call upon the Department of Community Affairs for such assistance as it deems necessary and may be available to it. b.    The Government Records Council shall: establish an informal mediation program to facilitate the resolution of disputes regarding access to government records; receive, hear, review and adjudicate a complaint filed by any person concerning a denial of access to a government record by a records custodian; issue advisory opinions, on its own initiative, as to whether a particular type of record is a government record which is accessible to the public; prepare guidelines and an informational pamphlet for use by records custodians in complying with the law governing access to public records; prepare a form for use by records custodians that allows residents of the custodians municipality the option to opt-out of having their address disclosed as a public record; prepare an informational pamphlet explaining the public's right of access to government records and the methods for resolving disputes regarding access, which records custodians shall make available to persons requesting access to a government record; prepare lists for use by records custodians of the types of records in the possession of public agencies which are government records; make training opportunities available for records custodians and other public officers and employees which explain the law governing access to public records; and operate an informational website and a toll-free helpline staffed by knowledgeable employees of the council during regular business hours which shall enable any person, including records custodians, to call for information regarding the law governing access to public records and allow any person to request mediation or to file a complaint with the council when access has been denied; In implementing the provisions of subsections d. and e. of this section, the council shall: act, to the maximum extent possible, at the convenience of the parties; utilize teleconferencing, faxing of documents, e-mail and similar forms of modern communication; and when in-person meetings are necessary, send representatives to meet with the parties at a location convenient to the parties. c.     At the request of the council, a public agency shall produce documents and ensure the attendance of witnesses with respect to the council's investigation of any complaint or the holding of any hearing. d.    Upon receipt of a written complaint signed by any person alleging that a custodian of a government record has improperly denied that person access to a government record, the council shall [offer] require the parties [the opportunity] to attempt to resolve the dispute through mediation.  Mediation shall enable a person who has been denied access to a government record and the custodian who denied or failed to provide access thereto to attempt to mediate the dispute through a process whereby a neutral mediator, who shall be trained in mediation selected by the council, acts to encourage and facilitate the resolution of the dispute.  Mediation shall be an informal, nonadversarial process having the objective of helping the parties reach a mutually acceptable, voluntary agreement.  The mediator shall assist the parties in identifying issues, foster joint problem solving, and explore settlement alternatives. e.     If [any party declines mediation or if] mediation fails to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of all parties, the council shall initiate an investigation concerning the facts and circumstances set forth in the complaint.  The council shall make a determination as to whether the complaint is within its jurisdiction or frivolous or without any reasonable factual basis.  If the council shall conclude that the complaint is outside its jurisdiction, frivolous or without factual basis, it shall reduce that conclusion to writing and transmit a copy thereof to the complainant and to the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed.  Otherwise, the council shall notify the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed of the nature of the complaint and the facts and circumstances set forth therein. The custodian shall have the opportunity to present the board with any statement or information concerning the complaint which the custodian wishes. If the council is able to make a determination as to a record's accessibility based upon the complaint and the custodian's response thereto, it shall reduce that conclusion to writing and transmit a copy thereof to the complainant and to the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed. If the council is unable to make a determination as to a record's accessibility based upon the complaint and the custodian's response thereto, the council shall conduct a hearing on the matter in conformity with the rules and regulations provided for hearings by a State agency in contested cases under the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), insofar as they may be applicable and practicable.  The council shall, by a majority vote of its members, render a decision as to whether the record which is the subject of the complaint is a government record which must be made available for public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented.  If the council determines, by a majority vote of its members, that a custodian has knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), as amended and supplemented, and is found to have unreasonably denied access under the totality of the circumstances, the council may impose the penalties provided for in section 12 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-11).  A decision of the council may be appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.  A decision of the council shall not have value as a precedent for any case initiated in Superior Court pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6). All proceedings of the council pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible. f.     The council shall not charge any party a fee in regard to actions filed with the council.  The council shall be subject to the provisions of the "Open Public Meetings Act," P.L.1975, c.231 (C.10:4-6), except that the council may go into closed session during that portion of any proceeding during which the contents of a contested record would be disclosed.  A requestor who prevails in any proceeding shall be entitled to a reasonable attorney's fee. g.    The council shall not have jurisdiction over the Judicial or Legislative Branches of State Government or any agency, officer, or employee of those branches. (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.8) 5.    (New section)  a.  Notwithstanding any other law or rule or regulation to the contrary, whenever it is made to appear by verified petition to the Superior Court of the county in which a requestor for government records under P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) resides or has a primary place of business, the court may issue a protective order limiting the number and scope of requests a requestor may make.  The court may issue the protective order if it determines that the requestor has sought records under P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) for an improper purpose, which includes, but is not limited to, the harassment of a public agency or its employees.  The petition shall be accompanied by a declaration of facts by the public agency withholding the records demonstrating that it has complied with P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) and has made a good faith effort to reach an informal resolution of the issues relating to the records request. b.    The order specified in subsection a. of this section may limit, or in appropriate circumstances, eliminate, the public agencys duty to respond to government records requests from the requestor in the future. c.     Upon entry of an order pursuant to this section, the order of the court shall be immediately reviewable by petition to the appellate court.  A party shall, in order to obtain review of the order, file a petition within 20 days after service upon him or her of a written notice of entry of the order, or within further time not exceeding an additional 20 days as the court may for good cause allow.  If the notice is served by mail, the period within which to file the petition shall be increased by five days.  A stay of an order or judgment shall not be granted unless the petitioning party demonstrates that it will otherwise sustain irreparable damage and probable success on the merits.  Any person who fails to obey the order of the court shall be cited to show cause why he or she is not in contempt of court. d.    For the purposes of this section, the county of residence shall include any address listed on the request for the government records. 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill makes certain changes to the publics access to government records.  Specifically the bill:  exempts from disclosure e-mail addresses, home telephone numbers, unlisted or otherwise and cell phone numbers;   provides for a uniform per page rate for copying government records;   requires the Government Records Council to develop a form to be used by records custodians that will allow persons to opt-out of having their address made public;  permits a records custodian to require the requester to obtain the record from the agency website when the information requested is readily available on the website;  clarifies special service charges includes costs of labor;   requires the record custodian to accept a record request made on a document other than the adopted form if it contains a notice that it is an OPRA request and contains the information required on the adopted form;  provides records custodians a seven day extension to comply with large or complicated requests;  requires the requestor to pick up the requested documents within fourteen business days of the records being available;  requires contact information for the custodian of a public agency to be included on the agency website;  requires mediation for all complaints; and  requires that attorneys fees be awarded only when a knowing and willful violation is found. Also, this bill will permit a Superior Court to issue a protective order limiting the number and scope of requests a requestor may make under the open public records act, N.J.S.A.47:1A-1 et seq.  In appropriate circumstances, the court may eliminate a public agencys duty to respond to requests from the requestor in the future.  The bill will require the court, in issuing the order, to determine that the requestor has sought records under the act for an improper purpose, including, but not limited to, the harassment of a public agency or its employees.
