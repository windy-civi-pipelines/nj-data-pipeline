and amending R.S.43:21-6.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.43:21-6 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43:21-6. (a) Filing. (1)
Claims for benefits shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the
Director of the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of
the Department of Labor and Workforce Development of the State of New Jersey
may approve.  Each employer shall post and maintain on his premises printed
notices of his subject status, of such design, in such numbers and at such
places as the director of the division may determine to be necessary to give
notice thereof to persons in the employer's service.  Each employer shall give
to each individual at the time he becomes unemployed, for any reason, whether
the unemployment is permanent or temporary, a printed copy of benefit
instructions.  The benefit instructions given to the individual shall include,
but not be limited to, the following information:  (A) the date upon which the
individual becomes unemployed, and, in the case that the unemployment is
temporary, to the extent possible, the date upon which the individual is
expected to be recalled to work; and (B) that the individual may lose some or
all of the benefits to which he is entitled if he fails to file a claim in a
timely manner. Both the aforesaid notices and instructions, including information
detailing the time sensitivity of filing a claim, shall be supplied by the
division to employers without cost to them.  Nothing in this section shall be
construed so as to require an employer to re-hire an individual formerly in the
employer's service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Any claimant may choose
to certify, cancel or close his claim for unemployment insurance benefits at
any time, 24 hours a day and seven days a week, via the Internet on a website
developed by the division; however, any claim that is certified, cancelled or
closed after 7:00 PM will not be processed by the division until the next
scheduled posting date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) (1) Procedure for making
initial determinations with respect to benefit years commencing on or after
January 1, 1953.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A representative or representatives
designated by the director of the division and hereafter referred to as a
&quot;deputy&quot; shall promptly examine the claim, and shall notify the most
recent employing unit and, successively as necessary, each employer in inverse
chronological order during the base year.  Such notification shall require said
employing unit and employer to furnish such information to the deputy as may be
necessary to determine the claimant's eligibility and his benefit rights with
respect to the employer in question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In his discretion, the
director may appoint special deputies to make initial or subsequent
determinations under subsection (f) of R.S.43:21-4 and subsection (d) of
R.S.43:21-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If any employer or employing
unit fails to respond to the request for information within 10 days after the
mailing, or communicating by electronic means, of such request, the deputy
shall rely entirely on information from other sources, including an affidavit
to the best of the knowledge and belief of the claimant with respect to his
wages and time worked.  Except in the event of fraud, if it is determined that
any information in such affidavit is erroneous, no penalty shall be imposed on
the claimant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The deputy shall make an
initial determination contingent upon the receipt of all necessary information
and notify the claimant no later than <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>three<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>two</u> weeks
from the date on which the division received the claim for benefits.  If an
initial determination cannot be made due to the lack of documentation,
notification will be sent to the claimant providing a status of the claim.  The
division will then have an additional two weeks to obtain the missing
information in order to make the initial determination and advise the claimant
accordingly.  The initial determination shall show the weekly benefit amount
payable, the maximum duration of benefits with respect to the employer to whom
the determination relates, and the ratio of benefits chargeable to the
employer's account for benefit years commencing on or after July 1, 1986, and
also shall show whether the claimant is ineligible or disqualified for benefits
under the initial determination.  The employer whose account may be charged for
benefits payable pursuant to said determination shall be promptly notified
thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever an initial
determination is based upon information other than that supplied by an employer
because such employer failed to respond to the deputy's request for
information, such initial determination and any subsequent determination
thereunder shall be incontestable by the noncomplying employer, as to any
charges to his employer's account because of benefits paid prior to the close
of the calendar week following the receipt of his reply.  Such initial
determination shall be altered if necessary upon receipt of information from
the employer, and any benefits paid or payable with respect to weeks occurring
subsequent to the close of the calendar week following the receipt of the
employer's reply shall be paid in accordance with such altered initial
determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The deputy shall issue a
separate initial benefit determination with respect to each of the claimant's
base year employers, starting with the most recent employer and continuing as
necessary in the inverse chronological order of the claimant's last date of employment
with each such employer.  If an appeal is taken from an initial determination,
as hereinafter provided, by any employer other than the first chargeable base
year employer or for benefit years commencing on or after July 1, 1986, that
employer from whom the individual was most recently separated, then such appeal
shall be limited in scope to include only one or more of the following matters:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (A)  The correctness of the
benefit payments authorized to be made under the determination;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B)  Fraud in connection with
the claim pursuant to which the initial determination is issued;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (C)  The refusal of suitable
work offered by the chargeable employer filing the appeal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (D)  Gross misconduct as
provided in subsection (b) of R.S.43:21-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The amount of benefits payable
under an initial determination may be reduced or canceled if necessary to avoid
payment of benefits for a number of weeks in excess of the maximum specified in
subsection (d) of R.S.43:21-3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Unless the claimant or any
interested party, within seven calendar days after delivery of notification of
an initial determination or within 10 calendar days after such notification was
mailed to his or their last-known address and addresses, files an appeal from
such decision, such decision shall be final and benefits shall be paid or
denied in accordance therewith, except for such determinations as may be
altered in benefit amounts or duration as provided in this paragraph.  Benefits
payable for periods pending an appeal and not in dispute shall be paid as such
benefits accrue; provided that insofar as any such appeal is or may be an
appeal from a determination to the effect that the claimant is disqualified
under the provisions of R.S.43:21-5 or any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, benefits pending determination of the appeal shall be withheld only
for the period of disqualification as provided for in said section, and
notwithstanding such appeal, the benefits otherwise provided by this act shall
be paid for the period subsequent to such period of disqualification; and
provided, also, that if there are two determinations of entitlement, benefits
for the period covered by such determinations shall be paid regardless of any
appeal which may thereafter be taken, but no employer's account shall be charged
with benefits so paid, if the decision is finally reversed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Procedure for making
initial determinations in certain cases of concurrent employment, with respect
to benefit years commencing on or after January 1, 1953 and prior to benefit
years commencing on or after July 1, 1986.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Title, if an individual shows to the satisfaction of the
deputy that there were at least 13 weeks in his base period in each of which he
earned wages from two or more employers totaling $30.00 or more but in each of
which there was no single employer from whom he earned as much as $100.00, then
such individual's claim shall be determined in accordance with the special
provisions of this paragraph.  In such case, the deputy shall determine the
individual's eligibility for benefits, his average weekly wage, weekly benefit
rate and maximum total benefits as if all his base year employers were a single
employer.  Such determination shall apportion the liability for benefit charges
thereunder to the individual's several base year employers so that each
employer's maximum liability for charges thereunder bears approximately the
same relation to the maximum total benefits allowed as the wages earned by the
individual from each employer during the base year bears to his total wages
earned from all employers during the base year.  Such initial determination
shall also specify the individual's last date of employment within the base
year with respect to each base year employer, and such employers shall be
charged for benefits paid under said initial determination in the inverse
chronological order of such last date of employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Procedure for making
subsequent determinations with respect to benefit years commencing on or after
January 1, 1953. The deputy shall make determinations with respect to claims
for benefits thereafter in the course of the benefit year, in accordance with
any initial determination allowing benefits, and under which benefits have not
been exhausted, and each notification of a benefit payment shall be a
notification of an affirmative subsequent determination.  The allowance of
benefits by the deputy on any such determination, or the denial of benefits by
the deputy on any such determination, shall be appealable in the same manner
and under the same limitations as is provided in the case of initial
determinations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Appeals. Unless such
appeal is withdrawn, an appeal tribunal, after affording the parties reasonable
opportunity for fair hearing, shall affirm or modify the findings of fact and
the determination.  The parties shall be duly notified of such tribunal's
decision, together with its reasons therefor, which shall be deemed to be the
final decision of the board of review, unless further appeal is initiated pursuant
to subsection (e) of this section within 10 days after the date of notification
or mailing of the decision for any decision made on or before December 1, 2010,
or within 20 days after the date of notification or mailing of such decision
for any decision made after December 1, 2010.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Appeal tribunals. To
hear and decide disputed benefit claims, including appeals from determinations
with respect to demands for refunds of benefits under subsection (d) of
R.S.43:21-16, the director with the approval of the Commissioner of Labor and
Workforce Development shall establish impartial appeal tribunals consisting of
a salaried body of examiners under the supervision of a Chief Appeals Examiner,
all of whom shall be appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 11A of the
New Jersey Statutes, Civil Service and other applicable statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   Board of review. The
board of review may on its own motion affirm, modify, or set aside any decision
of an appeal tribunal on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in such
case, or direct the taking of additional evidence, or may permit any of the
parties to such decision to initiate further appeals before it. The board of
review shall permit such further appeal by any of the parties interested in a
decision of an appeal tribunal which is not unanimous and from any
determination which has been overruled or modified by any appeal tribunal.  The
board of review may remove to itself or transfer to another appeal tribunal the
proceedings on any claim pending before an appeal tribunal.  Any proceedings so
removed to the board of review shall be heard by a quorum thereof in accordance
with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.  The board of review
shall promptly notify the interested parties of its findings and decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   Procedure. The manner in
which disputed benefit claims, and appeals from determinations with respect to
(1) claims for benefits and (2) demands for refunds of benefits under
subsection (d) of R.S.43:21-16 shall be presented, the reports thereon required
from the claimant and from employers, and the conduct of hearings and appeals
shall be in accordance with rules prescribed by the board of review for
determining the rights of the parties, whether or not such rules conform to
common law or statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of
procedure.  A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in
connection with a disputed claim.  All testimony at any hearing upon a disputed
claim shall be recorded, but need not be transcribed unless the disputed claim
is further appealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   Witness fees. Witnesses
subpoenaed pursuant to this section shall be allowed fees at a rate fixed by
the director. Such fees and all expenses of proceedings involving disputed
claims shall be deemed a part of the expense of administering this chapter
(R.S.43:21-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)   Court review. Any
decision of the board of review shall become final as to any party upon the
mailing of a copy thereof to such party or to his attorney, or upon the mailing
of a copy thereof to such party at his last-known address.  The Division of
Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance and any party to a proceeding
before the board of review may secure judicial review of the final decision of
the board of review.  Any party not joining in the appeal shall be made a
defendant; the board of review shall be deemed to be a party to any judicial
action involving the review of, or appeal from, any of its decisions, and may
be represented in any such judicial action by any qualified attorney, who may
be a regular salaried employee of the board of review or has been designated by
it for that purpose, or, at the board of review's request, by the Attorney
General.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    Failure to give notice.
The failure of any public officer or employee at any time heretofore or
hereafter to give notice of determination or decision required in subsections
(b), (c) and (e) of this section, as originally passed or amended, shall not
relieve any employer's account of any charge by reason of any benefits paid,
unless and until that employer can show to the satisfaction of the director of
the division that the said benefits, in whole or in part, would not have been
charged or chargeable to his account had such notice been given.  Any
determination hereunder by the director shall be subject to court review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (j)    With respect to benefit
payments made on or after October 22, 2013, an employer's account shall not be
relieved of charges related to a benefit payment that was made erroneously from
the division if it is determined that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The erroneous benefit
payment was made because the employer, or an agent of the employer, failed to
respond in a timely or adequate manner to a request from the division for
information related to the claim for benefits; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The employer, or an
agent of the employer, has established a pattern of failing to respond in a
timely or adequate manner to requests from the division for information related
to claims for benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Determinations of the division
prohibiting the relief of charges pursuant to this subsection shall be subject
to appeal in the same manner as other determinations of the division related to
the charging of employer accounts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For purposes of subsection (j)
of this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Erroneous benefit
payment&quot; means a benefit payment that, except for the failure by the
employer, or an agent of the employer, to respond in a timely or adequate
manner to a request from the division for information with respect to the claim
for benefits, would not have been made; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Pattern of failing&quot;
means repeated documented failure on the part of the employer, or an agent of
the employer, to respond to requests from the division to the employer or
employer's agent for information related to a claim for benefits, except that
an employer, or an agent of an employer, shall not be determined to have
engaged in a &quot;pattern of failing&quot; if the number of failures to
respond to requests from the division for information related to claims for
benefits during the previous 365 calendar days is less than three, or if the
number of failures is less than two percent of the number of requests from the
division, whichever is greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (k)   The Department of Labor
and Workforce Development shall establish and maintain a procedure by which
personnel access rights to the department's primary system for unemployment
claims receipt and processing are comprehensively reviewed every calendar
quarter.  The procedure shall include an evaluation of access needs to the
primary unemployment claims receipt and processing system for all department
personnel and the adjustment, addition, or deletion of access rights for
department personnel based on the quarterly review.</p>
