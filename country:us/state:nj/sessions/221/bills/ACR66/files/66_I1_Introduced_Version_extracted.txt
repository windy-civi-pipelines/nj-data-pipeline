CARTER District 22 (Somerset and Union) Assemblyman  JAMES J. KENNEDY District 22 (Somerset and Union) SYNOPSIS Memorializes Congress and President to enact legislation establishing certain gun control measures. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Concurrent Resolution respectfully memorializing Congress and the President to enact legislation establishing certain gun control measures. Whereas, The United States has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world and there are more guns than people in this country; and Whereas, More Americans have been killed by guns since 1968 than have died in all the United States wars combined, beginning with the Revolutionary War, and weaknesses in this nations gun laws have resulted in a clear and imminent danger to its citizens; and Whereas, In recent years, the United States has been witness to  numerous horrific and preventable firearms-related mass tragedies which have heightened awareness of the danger that exists when adequate protections are not utilized to ensure that only responsible gun owners have access to firearms; and Whereas, United States citizens are dying each year due to gun violence in public schools, movie theaters, workplaces, houses of  worship, nightclubs, college campuses, athletic events, and concerts; and Whereas, Gun violence costs the United States an estimated $229 billion annually; and Whereas, The guns purchased to commit 63 of the 79 mass shootings since 1982 were purchased legally; and Whereas, The American Medical Association adopted a policy in  2016 calling gun violence in the United States a public health  crisis requiring a comprehensive public health response and solution; and Whereas, In 2004, Congress allowed the 1994 federal ban on the sale of semi-automatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices to expire, even though these  weapons cause devastating wounds and penetrate body armor, and are the "weapon of choice" for mass shooters, drug traffickers, weapons traffickers, gangs, and paramilitary extremist groups; and Whereas, Since 1996, Congress has included language in every Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Bill, known as the Dickey Amendment, which prohibits the Center for Disease Controls appropriations dedicated for injury prevention and control from being used to advocate or promote firearm control; and Whereas, Assault firearms are banned in New Jersey and six other states, as well as in the District of Columbia, but are legal in the overwhelming majority of states; and Whereas, Several municipalities in New Jersey have instituted gun buyback programs, which allow citizens to turn in handguns and other firearms, usually for a reward and without fear of prosecution and have proven to be successful in reducing the number of weapons on the street being used to commit crimes; and Whereas, The Governor of New Jersey recently signed into law P.L.2018, c.36, which requires a National Instant Criminal Background Check (NICS) prior to transactions involving private person-to-person sales of a firearm; and Whereas, New Jersey has some of the most stringent firearm restrictions in the nation and is listed among states that have the lowest rates of firearm related deaths; and Whereas, It is clear that Congress and the President should follow the example set by the State of New Jersey and establish gun control measures to enhance public safety and prevent further deaths by firearms; and Whereas, It is, therefore, fitting and proper that the United States Congress and President enact legislation to require criminal background checks for all gun sales, including gun show sales; reinstate and strengthen the assault weapons ban; appropriate funding to research smart gun technology and establish a federal gun buy-back program focused on reducing the number of assault firearms in circulation across the country; and repeal the Dickey Amendment and fully fund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research to study firearm violence; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey (the Senate concurring): 1.    This House respectfully memorializes Congress and the President of the United States to enact legislation to require criminal background checks for all gun sales, including gun show sales; reinstate and strengthen the assault weapons ban; appropriate funding to research smart gun technology and establish a federal gun buy-back program focused on reducing the number of assault firearms in circulation across the country; and repeal the Dickey Amendment and fully fund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research to study firearm violence. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the President and Vice President of the United States and every member of the New Jersey Congressional delegation. STATEMENT This resolution memorializes Congress and the President of the United States to enact legislation establishing certain gun control measures. In recent years, the United States has been witness to numerous horrific and preventable firearms-related mass tragedies which have heightened awareness of the danger that exists when adequate protections are not utilized to ensure that only responsible gun owners have access to firearms. This resolution memorializes Congress and the President of the United States to enact legislation to require criminal background checks for all gun sales, including gun show sales; reinstate and strengthen the assault weapons ban; appropriate funding to research smart gun technology and establish a federal gun buy-back program focused on reducing the number of assault firearms in circulation across the country; and repeal the Dickey Amendment and fully fund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research to study firearm violence.
