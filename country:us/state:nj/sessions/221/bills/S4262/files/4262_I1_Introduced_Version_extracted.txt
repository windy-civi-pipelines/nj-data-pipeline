(e) at the next board of education meeting following its receipt of the report pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph (6) of this subsection, the board shall issue a decision, in writing, to affirm, reject, or modify the superintendent's decision.   The board's decision may be appealed to the Commissioner of Education, in accordance with the procedures set forth in law and regulation, no later than 90 days after the issuance of the board's decision;

A school district may apply to the Department of Education for a grant to be used for programs, approaches, or personnel established pursuant to this act, to the extent funds are appropriated for these purposes or funds are made available through the "Bullying Prevention Fund" established pursuant to section 25 of P.L.2010, c.122 (C.18A:37-28).  A school district may make an application for a grant only after exploring bullying prevention programs and approaches that are available at no cost, and making an affirmative demonstration of that exploration in its grant application. b.    A school district shall: (1) provide training on the school district's harassment, intimidation, or bullying policies to school employees and volunteers who have significant contact with students; (2) ensure that the training includes instruction on preventing bullying on the basis of the protected categories enumerated in section 2 of P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-14) and other distinguishing characteristics that may incite incidents of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying; including information on how to identify and address antisemitic incidents of harassments, intimidation or bullying; and (3) develop a process for discussing the district's harassment, intimidation or bullying policy with students. A school district may satisfy the training required pursuant to this subsection by utilizing training that may be provided at no cost by the Department of Education, the New Jersey State Bar Foundation, or any other entity.  A school district may, at its own discretion, implement a training program which imposes a cost on the district. c.     Information regarding the school district policy against harassment, intimidation or bullying shall be incorporated into a school's employee training program and shall be provided to full-time and part-time staff, volunteers who have significant contact with students, and those persons contracted by the district to provide services to students.

The bill directs a public institution of higher education to include within its student conduct policy information on lawful acts of campus activism that maintain students rights to protest, petition, and assemble.  The guidelines are to clearly identify impermissible acts of campus activism that may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to: (1) damage to school and public property; (2) disruption of the institutions educational or business interests; (3) obstruction of the movement of others through the organization of encampments or blockades that interfere with other students ability to enter or exit institution property; (4) protests on private property without consent; (5) acts of violence; (6) organizational affiliation with Foreign Terrorist Organizations as designated by the United States Secretary of State; such as Hamas; and (7) student behavior that constitutes a violation of the institutions HIB policy.  The policy is to include information on disciplinary action that may result if a student violates this student conduct policy governing campus protests, including academic probation, suspension, expulsion, and referral to law enforcement. The bill also makes the following updates to the ABR for school districts: (1) provides that consequences and remedial action imposed for a first act of HIB may include suspension and expulsion when the basis for the complaint is antisemitic behavior; and (2) requires training on a school districts HIB policies that is provided to applicable school employees and volunteers to include information on how to identify and address antisemitic incidents of HIB.

A school district may apply to the Department of Education for a grant to be used for programs, approaches, or personnel established pursuant to this act, to the extent funds are appropriated for these purposes or funds are made available through the "Bullying Prevention Fund" established pursuant to section 25 of P.L.2010, c.122 (C.18A:37-28).  A school district may make an application for a grant only after exploring bullying prevention programs and approaches that are available at no cost, and making an affirmative demonstration of that exploration in its grant application. b.    A school district shall: (1) provide training on the school district's harassment, intimidation, or bullying policies to school employees and volunteers who have significant contact with students; (2) ensure that the training includes instruction on preventing bullying on the basis of the protected categories enumerated in section 2 of P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-14) and other distinguishing characteristics that may incite incidents of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying; including information on how to identify and address antisemitic incidents of harassments, intimidation or bullying; and (3) develop a process for discussing the district's harassment, intimidation or bullying policy with students. A school district may satisfy the training required pursuant to this subsection by utilizing training that may be provided at no cost by the Department of Education, the New Jersey State Bar Foundation, or any other entity.  A school district may, at its own discretion, implement a training program which imposes a cost on the district. c.     Information regarding the school district policy against harassment, intimidation or bullying shall be incorporated into a school's employee training program and shall be provided to full-time and part-time staff, volunteers who have significant contact with students, and those persons contracted by the district to provide services to students.

STATEMENT This bill establishes The CAMPUS Act: Combating Antisemitism to Mitigate Prejudice in Universities and Schools, directs public institutions of higher education to include within its student conduct policy information on lawful acts of campus activism that maintain students right to protest, petition, and assemble, and makes updates to various provisions of the Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights Act (ABR). Under the bill, a public institution of higher educations HIB policy is to include a procedure for reporting an act of HIB and a procedure for prompt investigations of HIB reports.  The bill also permits a public institution of higher education to impose disciplinary action on a student found to have committed an antisemitic act of HIB that includes academic probation, suspension, and expulsion. The bill directs a public institution of higher education to include within its student conduct policy information on lawful acts of campus activism that maintain students rights to protest, petition, and assemble.  The guidelines are to clearly identify impermissible acts of campus activism that may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to: (1) damage to school and public property; (2) disruption of the institutions educational or business interests; (3) obstruction of the movement of others through the organization of encampments or blockades that interfere with other students ability to enter or exit institution property; (4) protests on private property without consent; (5) acts of violence; (6) organizational affiliation with Foreign Terrorist Organizations as designated by the United States Secretary of State; such as Hamas; and (7) student behavior that constitutes a violation of the institutions HIB policy.  The policy is to include information on disciplinary action that may result if a student violates this student conduct policy governing campus protests, including academic probation, suspension, expulsion, and referral to law enforcement. The bill also makes the following updates to the ABR for school districts: (1) provides that consequences and remedial action imposed for a first act of HIB may include suspension and expulsion when the basis for the complaint is antisemitic behavior; and (2) requires training on a school districts HIB policies that is provided to applicable school employees and volunteers to include information on how to identify and address antisemitic incidents of HIB. Finally, the bill requires instruction provided to students on the Holocaust and genocides to also include information on antisemitism and recent acts of terror and intimidation against the Jewish community.
