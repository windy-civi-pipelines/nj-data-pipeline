Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  Sections
1, 2, and 4 of this act shall be known and may be cited as The CAMPUS Act:
Combating Antisemitism to Mitigate Prejudice in Universities and Schools. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     A Hillel International
Study tracking antisemitism on college campuses reported that as of January 30,
2025 a total of 2,912 antisemitic incidents had been reported on college
campuses during the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic year, and that since the
terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, antisemitic incidents against
Jewish students on college campuses increased by 700 percent from the 2022-2023
academic year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Given the alarming rise
of antisemitism on college campuses and in schools, it is critical to address
discrimination against Jewish students in these educational spaces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Jewish students
increasingly report feeling unsafe and harassed on campus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The purpose of this bill
is to combat antisemitism in public schools and public institutions of higher
education throughout New Jersey and to ensure schools are safe and inclusive
spaces for all students, regardless of their religious, ethnic, or national
background.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Section 28 of P.L.2010,
c.122 (C.18A:3B-68) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     28.  a.  A public institution
of higher education shall adopt a policy to be included in its student code of conduct
prohibiting harassment, intimidation, or bullying.  The policy shall contain,
at a minimum:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A statement prohibiting
harassment, intimidation, or bullying;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Disciplinary actions
which may result if a student commits an act of harassment, intimidation, or
bullying<u>.  Disciplinary actions imposed for antisemitic incidents that
constitute harassment, intimidation, or bullying may include, but not be
limited to, academic probation, suspension, and expulsion</u>; <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   A definition of
harassment, intimidation, or bullying that at a minimum includes any gesture,
any written, verbal or physical act, or any electronic communication, whether
it be a single incident or a series of incidents, that is reasonably perceived
as being motivated either by any actual or perceived characteristic, such as
race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation,
gender identity and expression, or a mental, physical or sensory disability, or
by any other distinguishing characteristic, that takes place on the property of
the institution of higher education or at any function sponsored by the
institution of higher education, that substantially disrupts or interferes with
the orderly operation of the institution or the rights of other students and that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   a reasonable person
should know, under the circumstances, will have the effect of physically or
emotionally harming a student or damaging the student's property, or placing a
student in reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm to his person or
damage to his property; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   has the effect of
insulting or demeaning any student or group of students; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   creates a hostile
educational environment for the student by interfering with a student's
education or by severely or pervasively causing physical or emotional harm to
the student<u>;</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(4)   a procedure for
reporting an act of harassment, intimidation or bullying, including a provision
that permits a person to report the act anonymously; however, this shall not be
construed to permit formal disciplinary action solely on the basis of an
anonymous report; and</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(5)   a procedure for
prompt investigation of reports of harassment, intimidation, or bullying</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The institution shall
distribute the policy by email to each student within seven days of the start
of each semester and shall post the policy on its website.</p>

maintain students right to protest, petition, and assemble, and makes updates
to various provisions of the Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights Act (ABR).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a public
institution of higher educations HIB policy is to include a procedure for

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs a public
institution of higher education to include within its student conduct policy information
on lawful acts of campus activism that maintain students rights to protest,
petition, and assemble.  The guidelines are to clearly identify impermissible
acts of campus activism that may result in disciplinary action including, but
not limited to: (1) damage to school and public property; (2) disruption of the
institutions educational or business interests; (3) obstruction of the
movement of others through the organization of encampments or blockades that
interfere with other students ability to enter or exit institution property;
(4) protests on private property without consent; (5) acts of violence; (6) organizational
affiliation with Foreign Terrorist Organizations as designated by the United
States Secretary of State; such as Hamas; and (7) student behavior that
constitutes a violation of the institutions HIB policy.  The policy is to
include information on disciplinary action that may result if a student
violates this student conduct policy governing campus protests, including
academic probation, suspension, expulsion, and referral to law enforcement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also makes the
following updates to the ABR for school districts: (1) provides that
consequences and remedial action imposed for a first act of HIB may include
suspension and expulsion when the basis for the complaint is antisemitic
behavior; and (2) requires training on a school districts HIB policies that is
provided to applicable school employees and volunteers to include information
on how to identify and address antisemitic incidents of HIB.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires
instruction provided to students on the Holocaust and genocides to also include
information on antisemitism and recent acts of terror and intimidation against
the Jewish community. </p>
