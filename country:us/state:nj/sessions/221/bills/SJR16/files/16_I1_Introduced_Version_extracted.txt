CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Joint Resolution designating October of each year as Eczema Awareness Month in New Jersey. Whereas, Eczema is the name for a group of conditions that cause the skin to become red, itchy, and inflamed; and Whereas, Although the symptoms of eczema are typically mild, nearly half of those with the condition experience more severe symptoms, including dry, sensitive, rough, leathery, or scaly patches of skin; severe itching; and blistering, weeping, peeling, oozing, or crusting; and Whereas, Eczema can appear anywhere on the body.  The triggers for an eczema flare up can vary from person to person, and may include stress, sweat, obesity, soaps, detergents, and allergies to dust, pollen, or food; and Whereas, People with eczema may develop other conditions, including hay fever and asthma, chronic itchy or scaly skin, infections, other forms of dermatitis, sleep loss, depression, and hypertension; and Whereas, Eczema frequently first appears in childhood, but can also appear at any other time of life, and childhood symptoms may persist into adolescence and adulthood.  The condition is often characterized by long asymptomatic periods punctuated by periodic flare ups; and Whereas, The exact causes of eczema are not known, although research suggests that the condition is linked to a combination of genetic and environmental triggers; and Whereas, Eczema affects over 32 million Americans, with a national prevalence rate of approximately 10 percent and a prevalence rate in New Jersey of over 13 percent; and Whereas, Although eczema can be treated to alleviate its symptoms and prevent new outbreaks, there is currently no cure for the condition.  Treatments include daily bathing and moisturizing routines, over-the-counter remedies, prescription topical medications, phototherapy, immunosuppressants, and biologic drugs, as well as various natural and alternative treatments; and Whereas, The American Academy of Dermatology estimates that the costs for treating eczema and coexisting conditions may be as high as $3.8 billion per year. Moreover, people living with eczema frequently experience an emotional and social toll, particularly when others avoid contact with them out of a misconception that eczema is contagious; and Whereas, Additional research, educational outreach, and public awareness  efforts may help identify the causes of eczema, improve current treatments, identify new treatments, improve access to care, reduce the financial and social costs associated with eczema, and alleviate the stigma felt by many who live with eczema; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    October of each year is designated as Eczema Awareness Month in New Jersey in order to increase public awareness about eczema, generate a greater understanding of the condition, and foster a greater sense of community and shared purpose among individuals living with eczema and the general public. 2.    The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation designating October as Eczema Awareness Month in New Jersey, and calling upon public officials and the citizens of the State to observe the month with appropriate activities and programs. 3.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the National Eczema Association. 4.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution designates October of each year as Eczema Awareness Month in New Jersey and calls upon the Governor to issue an annual proclamation and call upon public officials and the citizens of the State to observe the month with appropriate activities and programs. Eczema describes a group of skin conditions that is estimated to affect more than 32 million people nationwide.  The goal in declaring October of each year to be Eczema Awareness Month is to increase public awareness about eczema, generate a greater understanding of the condition, and foster a greater sense of community and shared purpose among individuals living with eczema and the general public.
