<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  a.  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  Accessory dwelling units
are a valuable form of housing and present a way to expand the States housing
supply that is both cost-effective and consistent with sound planning and
environmental principles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Accessory dwelling units
provide housing for family members, the elderly, in-home health care providers,
individuals with disabilities, households of low and moderate income, and
others, often at below-market prices within existing neighborhoods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Homeowners who develop
accessory dwelling units can benefit from added income and an increased sense
of security.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  Allowing accessory
dwelling units in single-family and two-family residential zones will make it
possible to expand the state of New Jerseys rental housing stock, and meet
current and future housing demand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  Accessory dwelling units
offer lower-cost housing within existing neighborhoods while maintaining the
architectural character of a neighborhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  Accessory dwelling units
should therefore be considered an essential component of New Jerseys housing
supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    It is the intent of the
Legislature that municipal land use regulations shall provide for the creation
of accessory dwelling units consistent with the provisions of P.L.      ,
c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and that no
provision of any such regulation shall restrict the ability of a property owner
to develop accessory dwelling units consistent with the provisions of P.L.     
, c.      (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  As used
in sections 1 through 7 of P.L.     , c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.     
through C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Accessory dwelling unit
means a residential dwelling unit that provides complete independent living
facilities for one or more persons, including provisions for living, sleeping,
eating, cooking, and sanitation, and is located within a proposed or existing
primary dwelling, within an existing or proposed accessory structure,
constructed in whole or part as an extension to a proposed or existing primary
dwelling, or constructed as a separate detached structure on the same lot as
the existing or proposed primary dwelling.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Accessory structure means a

housing element shall contain an analysis demonstrating that it will provide
such a realistic opportunity, and the municipality shall establish that its
land use and other relevant ordinances have been revised to incorporate the
provisions for low and moderate income housing.  In preparing the housing
element, the municipality shall consider the following techniques for providing
low and moderate income housing within the municipality, as well as such other
techniques as may be published by the council or proposed by the municipality:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  Rezoning for densities

remain affordable to low and moderate income households for an appropriate
period of not less than six years;</p>

veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as referenced in this
subsection, and who apply within 90 days of the initial marketing period shall
receive preference for the rental of the agreed-upon percentage of affordable
units.  After the first 90 days of the initial 120-day marketing period, if any
of those units subject to the preference remain available, then applicants from
the general public shall be considered for occupancy.  Following the initial
120-day marketing period, previously qualified applicants and future qualified
applicants who are veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as
referenced in this subsection, shall be placed on a special waiting list as
well as the general waiting list.  The veterans on the special waiting list
shall be given preference for affordable units, as the units become available,
whenever the percentage of preference-occupied units falls below the agreed
upon percentage.  Any agreement to provide affordable housing preferences for
veterans pursuant to this subsection shall not affect a municipality's ability
to receive credit for the unit from the council, or its successor.</p>

minimum sideyard or rearyard setback requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would allow a

primary dwelling to that square footage that is not in excess of 60 percent of
the lots buildable area, as defined in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that an
application to develop an ADU is to be considered and approved ministerially,
without public hearing, and without review beyond that necessary to determine
compliance with the provisions of the bill or municipal land use regulations
adopted consistent with the bill.  The bill would allow a municipal agency to
charge a reasonable fee to cover the costs associated with reviewing and
approving an application to develop an accessory dwelling unit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a municipal
agency to provide an applicant with its decision on an application to develop
an ADU within 60 days of the date the applicant submits a complete
application.  Unless the applicant agrees to toll this 60-day time period, if
the municipal agency does not act upon the application within the 60-day time
period, the application is to be deemed approved.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If an application to develop
an ADU is submitted together with an application to develop a new single-family
dwelling on the same lot, upon the applicants request, the appropriate municipal
agency is to consider and act upon both applications as a single application. 
The bill would prohibit a municipal agency from imposing conditions, beyond
those necessary to comply with the provisions of the bill, upon the approval of
an application to develop an ADU, if the application is submitted together with
an application to develop a new single-family dwelling on the same lot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill would
prohibit a municipality from:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span>requiring, for an application to develop an ADU within an
existing primary dwelling or as an extension onto an existing primary dwelling,
the installation of a new or separate utility connection directly between the
ADU and the utility, or imposition of a related connection fee or capacity
charge, unless the ADU is being constructed together with a new single-family
dwelling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If an application is submitted
to develop an ADU as a separate structure, not part of an existing primary
dwelling, a municipal agency may require the applicant to install a new or
separate utility connection directly between the ADU and the utility, subject
to a connection fee or capacity charge of no more than half the fee charged for
a new primary dwelling, which fee shall not exceed the reasonable cost of
providing this service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would not supersede
provisions of the State Uniform Construction Code applicable to the
construction of ADUs, however, the bill specifies that the provisions of the
Rehabilitation Subcode of the State Uniform Construction Code is to apply to
the construction of an ADU within an existing primary dwelling.  Additionally,
the bill would prohibit issuance of a certificate of occupancy for an ADU under
the State Uniform Construction Code prior to issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for the primary dwelling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require a
municipality to submit land use regulations it adopts concerning ADUs to the
Department of Community Affairs within 60 days of the date of adoption of the
municipal land use regulations.  The department would review the municipal land
use regulations concerning ADUs and notify the municipality within 60 days of
the date the department receives a municipalitys regulations of any provision
in the regulations that does not comply with the bills provisions.  Under the
bill, if the department does not notify a municipality, within 60 days of the
date the department receives a municipalitys land use regulations concerning
ADUs, that a provision of the municipal land use regulations does not comply
with the bills provisions, the regulations are to be deemed approved. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 90 days of the date a
municipality receives notice of the departments determination that a provision
of the municipalitys land use regulations does not comply with the provisions
of this bill, the municipality shall either: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     amend its regulations to conform
them with the provisions and intent of the bill; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     respond to the department by:
asking it to approve the municipal regulations, and explaining the
municipalitys reasons why its regulations do not comply with the provisions
and intent of this bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of the latter, the
department would review the municipalitys response, consider the specific
conditions affecting that municipality, as well as the intent of this bill, and
notify the municipality either:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     that the municipality may
retain all or some part of its land use regulations; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     that the municipality is
required to amend provisions of its land use regulations to be consistent with
the provisions and intent of the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 60 days of the date of
receipt of the departments notice requiring it to amend its land use
regulations to be consistent with the provisions and intent of the bill, the
municipality is required to amend its regulations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a municipality does not
approve an application to develop an ADU, or imposes conditions on an approval
of an application to develop an ADU, the applicant may appeal the decision to
the Commissioner of Community Affairs.  If the commissioner determines that the
municipalitys reasons for withholding approval or imposing conditions are inconsistent
with the bills provisions, the commissioner is required to approve the
application, and levy the cost of the proceedings, including the applicants
legal expenses, if any, against the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends the law
governing associations formed for the management of common elements and
facilities of a planned real  estate development to prohibit the adoption or enforcement
of a restriction, covenant, bylaw, rule, regulation, master deed provision, or governing
document provision that prohibits or unreasonably restricts the development or
use of an ADU on a lot zoned for single-family residential use if the proposed ADU
is consistent with the bills requirements.  Under the bill, any provisions of a
planned real  estate developments governing documents that either prohibit or
unreasonably restrict the development or use of an ADU on a lot zoned for
single-family or two-family residential use is void and unenforceable if the
proposed ADU is consistent with the requirements of the bill.  However, the
bill specifically authorizes an association to impose design or landscaping
conditions on the development of an ADU if the conditions: are not in excess of
conditions generally imposed within the planned real estate development; do not
unreasonably increase the cost to construct, effectively prohibit the
construction of, or extinguish the ability to otherwise construct, an ADU
consistent with the provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also amend the
&quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
N.J.S.A.52:27D-301 et al., to require a municipality's master plan housing
element to include a plan to promote the creation of ADUs that will be offered
at affordable rent for low- and moderate-income households, and to clarify that
amounts deposited in the &quot;New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund&quot;
may be applied for the purpose of creating ADUs to be occupied by low- and
moderate-income households. </p>
