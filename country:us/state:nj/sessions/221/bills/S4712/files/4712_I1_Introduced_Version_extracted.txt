Commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026, there shall be annually appropriated an amount equal to the revenues derived from the tax imposed on the receipts from the sale of aviation fuels used by airlines under the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax Act, P.L.1990, c.42 (C.54:15B-1 et seq.) to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in support of the capital and operating costs of extending the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation rail service to Newark Liberty International Airport. c.

(cf: P.L.2010, c.38, s.5) 4.  This act shall take effect 90 days following enactment. STATEMENT This bill eliminates a tax exemption that airlines receive on their use of aviation fuel and provides funding needed to complete the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH) rail service extension to Newark Liberty International Airport and other airport capital projects that qualify as federally permitted uses of revenue from the taxation of aviation fuel used by airlines. Currently, common carriers are exempt from taxation on interstate and foreign flights except for that portion of aviation fuel that is used in burnout, during taxiing and take-off. This bill taxes the entire receipts from the sale of aviation fuels used by all airlines, except for certain circumstances.
