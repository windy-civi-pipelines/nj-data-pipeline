Resolved </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate of the State of New

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The following proposed
amendment to the Constitution of the State of New Jersey is herby agreed to:</p>

AMENDMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Amend Article I,
paragraph 2, as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  All political power
is inherent in the people.  Government is instituted for the protection,
security, and benefit of the people, and they have the right at all times to
alter or reform the same, whenever the public good may require it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The people reserve unto
themselves the power to recall, after at least one year of service, any elected
official in this State or representing this State in the United States
Congress.  The Legislature shall enact laws to provide for such recall
elections. Any such laws shall include a provision that a recall election shall
be held upon petition of at least 25% of the registered voters in the electoral
district of the official sought to be recalled.  If legislation to implement
this constitutional amendment is not enacted within one year of the adoption of
the amendment, the Secretary of State shall, by regulation, implement the
constitutional amendment, except that regulations adopted by the Secretary of
State shall be superseded by any subsequent legislation consistent with this
constitutional amendment governing recall elections.  The sufficiency of any
statement of reasons or grounds procedurally required shall be a political
rather than a judicial question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>c.     The people reserve
unto themselves:  the power of initiative to propose to the Legislature
amendments to the Constitution and to approve or reject the same at the polls
in a general election if the Legislature does not, within a period to be
established by law but not exceeding two months from the date of submission to
the Legislature of the initiative petition proposing that amendment, complete
action to provide for the submission of the proposed amendment or a
substantially similar amendment to the people not later than the first general
election occurring after the 120th day following the expiration of that period;
and the power of initiative to propose to the Legislature laws which are not
only for the purpose of repeal and to approve or reject the same at the polls
in a general election if substantially similar legislation is not enacted by
the Legislature and the Governor, within a period to be established by law but
not exceeding two months from the date of submission to the Legislature of the
initiative petition proposing that law.  The determination of whether a
constitutional amendment proposed by the Legislature or legislation enacted by
the Legislature and the Governor is substantially similar to a constitutional
amendment or a law proposed by an initiative petition hereunder shall be made
by sponsors of the petition in accordance with such procedure as the
Legislature shall provide by general law.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The people also reserve
unto themselves the power of referendum to propose to the Legislature the
repeal of any law, or any section or part thereof, and to approve or reject
such repeal at the polls in a general election if such repeal is not enacted by
the Legislature and the Governor, within a period to be established by law but
not exceeding two months from the date of submission to the Legislature of the
referendum petition proposing that repeal.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>There shall be no power of
initiative or referendum to propose to the Legislature, and to approve or
reject at the polls, a law or constitutional amendment to require or prohibit
the siting of a public or private facility in a specific county or class of
counties, or in a specific municipality or class of municipalities, or a law or
constitutional amendment to repeal a law requiring or prohibiting such siting.</u></p>

Legislature the question of the continuance in force of any existing law.  The
Legislature (and the Governor, in the case of a proposal to enact or repeal a
law) are to respond to such a proposal within two months; otherwise, the people
are to have the power to adopt or enact the proposed constitutional amendment
or new law, or to reject the existing law, at the polls.  The power of
initiative and referendum is not to include the power to propose constitutional
amendments or laws to require or prohibit the siting of any facility in a
specific county or class of counties, or in a specific municipality or class of
municipalities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>To qualify a
constitutional amendment for submission to the Legislature, the petition which
proposes it must contain a number of signatures equal to at least 10% of the
number of votes cast for the office of Governor in the State in the
gubernatorial election preceding certification of the petition for
circulation.  To qualify a law of enactment or repeal, proposed by an initiative
petition or referendum petition, respectively, for submission to the
Legislature, the petition which proposes it must contain a number of signatures
equal to at least 6% of the number of votes cast for the office of Governor in
the State in the gubernatorial election preceding certification of the petition
for circulation.  These signature requirements would apply regionally as well
as Statewide:  the petition must include signatures from five counties in the
northeastern region of the State (the counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson,
Passaic, and Union), five counties in the northwestern region of the State (the
counties of Hunterdon, Morris, Somerset, Sussex, and Warren), five counties in
the central region of the State (the counties of Burlington, Mercer, Middlesex,
Monmouth, and Ocean), and six counties in the southern region of the State (the
counties of Atlantic, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, and Salem),
equal in number to at least 10% or 6%, as appropriate, of the votes cast for
the office of Governor in that preceding gubernatorial election within those
regions.  A limit on the time allowed for collecting the required number of
signatures may be established by law but shall not be less than one year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>Before a petition
could be submitted to the Legislature, it is to be filed with the Secretary of
State, who is to have 60 days to determine whether the petition was signed by
sufficient numbers of registered voters.  The Secretary of State is authorized
to make this determination on the basis of a sample of the signatures to the
petition chosen in accordance with appropriate random sampling techniques.  If
not found within the 60&#8209;day period to have been signed by insufficient
numbers of registered voters, the petition could be submitted to the
Legislature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>Once a
constitutional amendment or law of enactment proposed <br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
by initiative petition or a law of repeal proposed by referendum petition is
submitted to the Legislature, the Legislature (and the Governor, in the case of
a proposal to enact or repeal a law) would have such period of time as shall be
established by law, but not exceeding two months, in which to propose a
substantially similar constitutional amendment, enact a substantially similar
law of enactment, or enact the repeal, as appropriate.  In the absence of such
timely response, the proposed constitutional amendment or law of enactment or
repeal is to be submitted to the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>The constitutional
amendment provides that, prior to the submission to the voters of a proposed
law or repealer, any party may seek a declaratory judgment from the New Jersey
Supreme Court that the law or repealer violates the federal Constitution or law
or would be invalid under the State Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>If a
constitutional amendment or law proposed by initiative petition and submitted
to the people is not approved, or a law whose continuance is the subject of a
public question submitted to the people in a referendum is not rejected, then
neither that amendment, law or public question, nor one to effect the same or
substantially the same change, may be submitted to the people for approval or
rejection, as appropriate, before the second general election thereafter.  If a
law proposed by initiative petition is enacted by the people or a law in
response to such a petition is enacted by the Legislature and the Governor, or
if an existing law which is the subject of a referendum petition is repealed by
the people or the Legislature and the Governor, any revision or repeal of the
law so enacted, or reenactment of the law so repealed, would require a three&#8209;fourths
vote in each House of the Legislature during the first two years following that
enactment or repeal or a three&#8209;fifths vote in each House during the three
years following that two&#8209;year period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>The constitutional
amendment provides that no law proposed by an initiative or referendum petition
and approved by the people shall be subject to the veto power of the Governor. 
It also states that if conflicting constitutional amendments or laws proposed
by the initiative process are approved by the people at the same election, the
one receiving the highest number of affirmative votes is to be deemed approved.
