has a substantial interest in promoting quality care and improving the delivery
of health care services; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Evidenced-based studies

share a mutual interest in patient safety initiatives that create a healthy
environment for nurses and appropriate care for patients; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In order to protect
patients, support greater retention of registered nurses, and promote adequate
nurse staffing, it is in the States interest to establish a mechanism whereby
nurses and hospital management shall participate in a joint process regarding
decisions about nurse staffing.</p>
