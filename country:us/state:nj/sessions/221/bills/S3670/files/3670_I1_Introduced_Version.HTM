<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would provide
mortgage payment relief and foreclosure protection for certain homeowners

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Hurricane Ida initially
approached the Gulf Coast as a category 4 hurricane, and caused severe damage
to a large area of the south and northeast regions of the country.  In New
Jersey, thousands of families have been displaced and unable to return to their
homes as a result of this storm.  This bill would offer certain homeowners
impacted by the remnants of Hurricane Ida temporary protections against
foreclosure, and would require mortgage servicers to provide a temporary pause
in the mortgage payment obligations of the storm-impacted homeowners.  </p>

&quot;storm-impacted homeowner&quot; as a mortgagor who, as of August 31, 2021,

application publicly available.  The department would be required to review
each application to determine whether the applicant meets eligibility criteria
demonstrating their need for assistance, and if they do, issue a Certification
of Eligibility for Forbearance to the applicant, which would entitle the
applicant to receive a one-year mortgage forbearance from their mortgage
servicer.  Any homeowner who is denied a Certification of Eligibility for
Forbearance may appeal that decision, and any homeowner who obtains a
Certification of Eligibility for Forbearance but is denied a forbearance from a
mortgage servicer licensed by the Department of Banking and Insurance may file
a complaint with that agency, which must investigate, and if appropriate, order
the mortgage servicer to grant a forbearance.  </p>

extension of the mortgage, all terms and conditions of the original mortgage,
except with regard to default and delinquency during forbearance, are to
continue without modification, fees assessed, late penalties, or penalties for
early repayment.  The bill also requires a mortgage servicer to: submit certain
information, as specified in the bill, related to any pending actions involving
property granted a forbearance to the Superior Court Clerks Office; and, on a
monthly basis, submit certain information on all forbearances that the mortgage
servicer has provided within the State to the Department of Banking and Insurance,
except as provided in the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, a storm-impacted
homeowner who is the subject of a foreclosure proceeding would be awarded, by

the sixth month following the effective date of the bill, unless the courts in
their discretion permit application submission for a longer period.  The award
of a stay pursuant to the bill would conclude upon the earlier of:</p>
