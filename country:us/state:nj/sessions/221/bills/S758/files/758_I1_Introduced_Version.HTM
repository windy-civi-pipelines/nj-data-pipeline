<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> permanently re-establishing an arthritis initiative in
the Department of Human Services and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised
Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known,
and may be cited as, the Arthritis Quality of Life Initiative Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Arthritis is the most
common cause of disability, and one of the most costly chronic diseases, in the
United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    According to the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between 2013 and 2015, an
estimated 54.4 million U.S. adults (22.7 percent of the U.S. population) were
annually diagnosed with some form of arthritis, and 23.7 million (or 43.5
percent) of those adults reported experiencing limitations in their daily
activities as a result of the disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     As of 2015,
approximately 1.6 million people in New Jersey, or about 18 percent of the
States population, suffered from arthritis, and 675,000 (or 42 percent) of
those people reported experiencing limitations in their daily activities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    By the year 2040, the
CDC estimates that approximately 78 million U.S. adults (or 26 percent of the
U.S. population) will be annually diagnosed with arthritis, and 35 million of
those adults will be subject to arthritis-attributable activity limitations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Arthritis has a
profound economic impact, and in 2013, the most recent year for which CDC cost
data is available, the total nationwide arthritis-attributable medical care
costs and earnings losses among adults with arthritis totaled $303.5 billion,
or 1 percent of the total U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     On an individual level,
an adult with arthritis will spend approximately $2,117 more in medical costs
per year, and will take home $4,040 less in annual wages (due to lost
productivity), than an adult who does not have the disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Osteoarthritis, which is
the most common form of arthritis, affects more than 30 million adults in the
U.S. and was the second most costly health condition treated in U.S. hospitals
during 2013, accounting for $16.5 billion, or 4.3 percent, of the combined
costs for all hospitalizations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    There is no cure for
arthritis; however, there are varying treatment options, which may include
physical therapy, lifestyle changes, orthopedic bracing, medications, or joint
replacement surgery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     There are also programs
and services available that can allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment of
arthritis, and improve the quality of life of people who have this disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     In 1999, the New Jersey
Legislature enacted the Arthritis Quality of Life Initiative Act, P.L.1999,
c.72 (C.26:2V-1 et seq.), which required the Department of Health to establish
an arthritis-focused public education initiative and two regionally-based pilot
arthritis centers, and which further established an Advisory Council on
Arthritis to advise the department on the development and implementation of the
initiative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    In 2012, the initiative
and advisory council were transferred to the Department of Human Services;
however, only a year after this transfer occurred, the Legislature enacted
P.L.2013, c.253, which repealed the Arthritis Quality of Life Initiative Act
on the basis that the advisory council was no longer active.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     As evidenced by the
statistics described in this section, there is still a significant need for
arthritis-related public education and arthritis-focused care in this State and
nation, and it is, therefore, reasonable and necessary for the Legislature to
reinstate the previously existing Arthritis Quality of Life Initiative and the
Advisory Council on Arthritis in the Department of Human Services, in order to
ensure that there is a permanent mechanism pursuant to which the State can: 
(1) continuously increase public awareness of arthritis and available
advancements in care; (2) provide necessary information to reduce the physical
and emotional impact of arthritis, and to decrease the health care and economic
costs associated therewith; and (3) facilitate improved access to arthritis
care in the State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Council means the Advisory
Council on Arthritis that is established pursuant to this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commissioner means the
Commissioner of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Department means the
Department of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would re-establish
the Arthritis Quality of Life Initiative and the Advisory Council on Arthritis
in the Department of Human Services (DHS).  The initiative and the advisory
council were initially established in the Department of Health, through the
enactment of the Arthritis Quality of Life Initiative Act, at P.L.1999, c.72
(C.26:2V-1 et seq.).  In 2012, the Legislature transferred the initiative and
the advisory council to the DHS; but only a year later, in 2013, the
Legislature repealed the Arthritis Quality of Life Initiative Act, on the
basis that the advisory council was inactive.  This bill would permanently
reinstitute the initiative and the council in the DHS, in order to ensure that
arthritis continues to be sufficiently addressed in the State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
