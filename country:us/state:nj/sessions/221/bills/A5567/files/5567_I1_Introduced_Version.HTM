P.L.1991, c.261.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 12 of P.L.1991,
c.261 (C.2C:25-28) is amended to read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12. a. A victim may file a
complaint alleging the commission of an act of domestic violence with the
Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court in conformity with the
Rules of Court.  The court shall not dismiss any complaint or delay disposition
of a case because the victim has left the residence to avoid further incidents
of domestic violence.  Filing a complaint pursuant to this section shall not
prevent the filing of a criminal complaint for the same act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     On weekends, holidays and
other times when the court is closed, a victim may file a complaint before a
judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court or a
municipal court judge who shall be assigned to accept complaints and issue
emergency, ex parte relief in the form of temporary restraining orders pursuant
to this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A plaintiff may apply for
relief under this section in a court having jurisdiction over the place where
the alleged act of domestic violence occurred, where the defendant resides, or
where the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and the court shall follow the
same procedures applicable to other emergency applications.  Criminal
complaints filed pursuant to this act shall be investigated and prosecuted in
the jurisdiction where the offense is alleged to have occurred.  Contempt
complaints filed pursuant to N.J.S.2C:29-9 shall be prosecuted in the county
where the contempt is alleged to have been committed and a copy of the contempt
complaint shall be forwarded to the court that issued the order alleged to have
been violated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The court shall waive
any requirement that the petitioner's place of residence appear on the
complaint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  (1)  The clerk of the
court, or other person designated by the court, shall assist the parties in
completing any forms necessary for the filing of a summons, complaint, answer
or other pleading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The plaintiff may provide
information concerning firearms to which the defendant has access, including
the location of these firearms, if known, on a form to be prescribed by the
Administrative Director of the Courts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Information provided by
the plaintiff concerning firearms to which the defendant has access shall be
kept confidential and shall not be disseminated or disclosed, provided that
nothing in this subsection shall prohibit dissemination or disclosure of this
information in a manner consistent with and in furtherance of the purpose for
which the information was provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Summons and complaint
forms shall be readily available at the clerk's office, at the municipal courts
and at municipal and State police stations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     As soon as the domestic
violence complaint is filed, both the victim and the abuser shall be advised of
any programs or services available for advice and counseling<u>, as well as any
programs or services available for counseling for any minor children of either
party to the complaint</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A plaintiff may seek
emergency, ex parte relief in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A
municipal court judge or a judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of
the Superior Court may enter an ex parte order when necessary to protect the
life, health or well-being of a victim on whose behalf the relief is sought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    If it appears that the
plaintiff is in danger of domestic violence, the judge shall, upon
consideration of the plaintiff's domestic violence complaint, order emergency
ex parte relief, in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A decision
shall be made by the judge regarding the emergency relief forthwith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  (1)  A judge may issue a
temporary restraining order upon sworn testimony or complaint of an applicant
who is not physically present, pursuant to court rules, or by a person who
represents a person who is physically or mentally incapable of filing
personally.  A temporary restraining order may be issued if the judge is
satisfied that exigent circumstances exist sufficient to excuse the failure of
the applicant to appear personally and that sufficient grounds for granting the
application have been shown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The Administrative Office
of the Court shall prepare standard templates for temporary restraining orders
in English, Spanish, and the other high-demand languages identified in its
Language Access Plan as approved by the Supreme Court.  These templates shall
be available for law enforcement, judges of the Municipal Court, and judges and
staff of the Superior Court to provide to the victim and defendant when issuing
temporary restraining orders pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     An order for emergency,
ex parte relief shall be granted upon good cause shown and shall remain in
effect until a judge of the Family Part issues a further order.  Any temporary
order hereunder is immediately appealable for a plenary hearing de novo not on
the record before any judge of the Family Part of the county in which the
plaintiff resides or is sheltered if that judge issued the temporary order or
has access to the reasons for the issuance of the temporary order and sets
forth in the record the reasons for the modification or dissolution.  The
denial of a temporary restraining order by a municipal court judge and
subsequent administrative dismissal of the complaint shall not bar the victim
from refiling a complaint in the Family Part based on the same incident and
receiving an emergency, ex parte hearing de novo not on the record before a
Family Part judge, and every denial of relief by a municipal court judge shall
so state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     Emergency relief may
include forbidding the defendant from returning to the scene of the domestic
violence, forbidding the defendant from possessing any firearm or other weapon

Chancery Division of the Superior Court within 10 days of the filing of a
complaint pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-28) in the county
where the ex parte restraints were ordered, unless good cause is shown for the
hearing to be held elsewhere.  A copy of the complaint shall be served on the
defendant in conformity with the Rules of Court. If a criminal complaint
arising out of the same incident which is the subject matter of a complaint
brought under P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et seq.) or P.L.1991, c.261
(C.2C:25-17 et seq.) has been filed, testimony given by the plaintiff or
defendant in the domestic violence matter shall not be used in the simultaneous

violence contempt matters and where it would otherwise be admissible hearsay
under the rules of evidence that govern where a party is unavailable.  If there
are law enforcement records related to an incident which is the subject of a
complaint or the domestic violence history described in the complaint, and the
plaintiff has requested the records, the court shall grant plaintiff's request
for an adjournment if reasonably needed to collect evidence contained in the
law enforcement records.  If the plaintiff has requested records from a law
enforcement agency pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.322 (C.2C:25-23.1), but
has not received the records as of the date of the original or rescheduled
hearing, the law enforcement agency's failure to provide the requested records
shall be noted on the record prior to the court making a final determination on
the request for restraints.  The absence of law enforcement records shall not
be a basis to deny relief pursuant to this section.  At the hearing the
standard for proving the allegations in the complaint shall be by a
preponderance of the evidence.</p>

domestic violence between the plaintiff and defendant, including threats,
harassment and physical abuse; </p>

immediate danger to person or property; </p>

control against a person that in purpose or effect unreasonably interferes
with, threatens, or exploits a person's liberty, freedom, bodily integrity, or
human rights with the court specifically considering evidence of the need for
protection from immediate danger or the prevention of further abuse.  If the
court finds that one or more factors of coercive control are more or less
relevant than others, the court shall make specific written findings of fact
and conclusions of law on the reasons why the court reached that conclusion. 
Coercive control may include, but shall not be limited to:</p>

force, threat, or intimidation, including, but not limited to, threats based on
actual or suspected immigration status;</p>

making baseless reports to the police, courts, the Division of Child Protection

Revised Statutes; or</p>

of contempt under this act, shall not be subject to mediation or negotiation in
any form.  In addition, where a temporary or final order has been issued

or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a
handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3 during the period in which the restraining

jointly.  If it is not possible for the victim to remain in the residence, the
court may order the defendant to pay the victim's rent at a residence other

plaintiff and defendant.  Orders for parenting time may include a designation
of a place of parenting time away from the plaintiff, the participation of a
third party, or supervised parenting time.</p>

suspension of the parenting time order and hold an emergency hearing upon an
application made by the plaintiff certifying under oath that the defendant's

defendant to receive professional domestic violence counseling from either a
private source or a source appointed by the court and, in that event, requiring

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill permits the court to
order counseling for a child in a proceeding involving domestic violence.  The
bill also permits the court to order legal and physical custody of a minor
child to the plaintiff in certain circumstances involving domestic violence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law provides that
pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-28), once a domestic violence
complaint is filed, the victim and the abuser should be advised of any programs
or services available for advice and counseling.  The statute does not require
that the victim and the abuser be advised of specific services available for
counseling for any minor children of either party to the complaint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill permits a court to
order counseling in appropriate cases, including when a child witnesses or
experiences domestic violence while residing in the household with the abuser
and the victim.  Additionally, the bill permits the court to order the abusive
party, to pay for the domestic violence counseling provided to the child.  A
defendant ordered to pay for domestic violence counseling is required to show
proof of payment of the services to the court.  The bill permits the court to
order a defendant to provide reimbursement for costs incurred in providing
counseling for a child.  The court may enter this order upon evaluating and
determining the defendants ability to pay for such services.  The defendant
may be required to pay the victim directly, reimburse the Victims of Crime
Compensation Office for compensation paid to the victim from the Victims of
Crime Compensation Office, or reimburse any party that may have compensated the
victim.  The bill clarifies that any direct payment to the plaintiff is not
permitted to be made in person, but may be made electronically or in any other
manner that does not require contact between the victim and the defendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes
that, upon the issuance of a final restraining order, there is a presumption
that legal and physical custody be awarded to the non-abusive parent.  Nothing
in the bill precludes the non-custodial parent from making an application to
the court to modify custody after an award of custody to the non-abusive
parent.  The bill establishes that the absent good cause to the contrary, and
upon request of the victim, the court is required to order in any subsequent
child support proceeding following the entry of a final restraining order, the
victim is not required to be in the same room as the person found by the court
to have committed domestic violence.  Further the victims and childs
whereabouts are required to be kept confidential.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill clarifies that the
court consider a request by a custodial parent who has been subjected to
domestic violence by a person with parenting time rights to a child in the
parents custody for an investigation or evaluation to assess the risk of harm
to the child prior to entering a parenting time order.  Currently, the
provisions of section N.J.S.A.2C:25-29 specify that the investigation or
evaluation would be conducted by an appropriate agency.</p>
