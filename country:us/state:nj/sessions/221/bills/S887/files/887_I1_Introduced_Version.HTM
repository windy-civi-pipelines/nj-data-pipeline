The bill supplements Title 26 of the Revised Statutes to provide that no information of a child is to be reported by a health care provider to, or otherwise shared with, the Department of Health, or any other local or State governmental employee or entity, without first obtaining the express, informed, and written consent of the childs parent or legal guardian.  However, the bills provisions do not prohibit reporting or sharing a childs information if a health care provider has reasonable cause to believe that a child has been subjected to child abuse, including sexual abuse. Further, the bill amends various statutes within Title 26 of the Revised Statues regarding registries for autism, lead screening, birth defects, hearing loss, severe neonatal jaundice, sudden cardiac events, and vaccines, to provide that no information is to be reported to the Department of Health without first obtaining the express, informed, and written consent of the childs parent or legal guardian.
