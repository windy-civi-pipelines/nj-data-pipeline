(cf: P.L.2023, c.282, s.2) 6.    (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 7 and 21 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-66 and C.52:27H-80), for an enterprise zone designated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (10) of subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.1995, c.382 (C.52:27H-66.1), the receipts of all retail sales of goods not exempted from the provisions of section 21 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-80) from a seller who is certified by the director pursuant to that section, shall be exempt to the extent of 50 percent of the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) but shall be collected in a manner consistent with that act.  The revenues derived from the sales tax collected from those retail sales shall be deposited into the dedicated public safety services trust fund established pursuant to subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.2021, c.497 (C.5:12-152.1) and shall be used by the municipality solely and exclusively to fund appropriations for public safety services. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, designated as the Atlantic City Urban Enterprise Zone and Property Tax Relief Act, authorizes the creation of an urban enterprise zone (zone or UEZ) in the city of Atlantic City for a one-time term of 10 years.  The bill requires designation of the Atlantic City UEZ within 90 days of the date Atlantic City submits a UEZ application and zone development plan. Qualifying retail businesses located within the new zone to be designated under the bill would be able to charge and collect a reduced sales and use tax , set at 50 percent of the sales and use tax (SUT) rate.  A business operating as a casino does not qualify as an eligible business under the UEZ program, however, a business operating on casino property which is not owned by a casino business may be eligible if it otherwise meets the criteria for business eligibility. Under the bill, all of the SUT revenues collected within the Atlantic City UEZ are to be appropriated for use by Atlantic City for public safety purposes.  The revenues derived from the receipts of all retail sales of non-exempt goods are to be deposited into the dedicated public safety services trust fund established pursuant to subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.2021, c.497 (C.5:12-152.1) and are to be used by the municipality solely and exclusively to fund appropriations for public safety services. This bill is meant to address the negative economic conditions experienced by Atlantic City over the past several years as the city transitions from a casino gaming destination to a general-interest tourist destination.

As used in this section, "project" means an activity that satisfies the requirements of a qualified assistance fund expense, as that term is defined in subsection m. of section 3 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-62), and which will lead to the creation of new jobs and increased economic activity within the zone. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) g.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) h.    At the end of a State fiscal year, if a municipality has not encumbered a portion of its allocation, such amount may be carried forward to the next State fiscal year and the State fiscal year thereafter.  If at the end of the third State fiscal year any of those unencumbered funds remain, then the funds shall be transferred to the UEZ Authority's account in the enterprise zone assistance fund. i.     At the end of a State fiscal year, if a municipality has not expended or otherwise committed a portion of its encumbered funds, then such amount may be carried forward to the next three succeeding State fiscal years.  If at the end of the third State fiscal year any unexpended funds remain, then the funds shall be transferred to the UEZ Authority's account in the enterprise zone assistance fund. j.     At the end of a State fiscal year, the Department of Community Affairs shall review an enterprise zone's expenditures of funds received from the zone assistance fund.  If the department finds that an enterprise zone expended such funds in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.) and P.L.2021, c.197, then the enterprise zone shall repay such funds to the department through the forfeiture of future zone assistance fund disbursements.  The department shall withhold future funding from the enterprise zone until the enterprise zone enters into and complies with a corrective action plan developed by the department. k.    If in a State fiscal year the amount allocated to the enterprise zone assistance fund is less than the amount required to be allocated to fulfill the purposes of this section pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2021, c.197 (C.52:27H-98) and paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section, the Legislature shall appropriate to the enterprise zone assistance fund the amount that was not allocated in such State fiscal year in a succeeding State fiscal year along with the funds required to be allocated in that State fiscal year. (cf: P.L.2023, c.282, s.2) 6.    (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 7 and 21 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-66 and C.52:27H-80), for an enterprise zone designated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (10) of subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.1995, c.382 (C.52:27H-66.1), the receipts of all retail sales of goods not exempted from the provisions of section 21 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-80) from a seller who is certified by the director pursuant to that section, shall be exempt to the extent of 50 percent of the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) but shall be collected in a manner consistent with that act.  The revenues derived from the sales tax collected from those retail sales shall be deposited into the dedicated public safety services trust fund established pursuant to subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.2021, c.497 (C.5:12-152.1) and shall be used by the municipality solely and exclusively to fund appropriations for public safety services. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, designated as the Atlantic City Urban Enterprise Zone and Property Tax Relief Act, authorizes the creation of an urban enterprise zone (zone or UEZ) in the city of Atlantic City for a one-time term of 10 years.  The bill requires designation of the Atlantic City UEZ within 90 days of the date Atlantic City submits a UEZ application and zone development plan. Qualifying retail businesses located within the new zone to be designated under the bill would be able to charge and collect a reduced sales and use tax , set at 50 percent of the sales and use tax (SUT) rate.  A business operating as a casino does not qualify as an eligible business under the UEZ program, however, a business operating on casino property which is not owned by a casino business may be eligible if it otherwise meets the criteria for business eligibility. Under the bill, all of the SUT revenues collected within the Atlantic City UEZ are to be appropriated for use by Atlantic City for public safety purposes.  The revenues derived from the receipts of all retail sales of non-exempt goods are to be deposited into the dedicated public safety services trust fund established pursuant to subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.2021, c.497 (C.5:12-152.1) and are to be used by the municipality solely and exclusively to fund appropriations for public safety services. This bill is meant to address the negative economic conditions experienced by Atlantic City over the past several years as the city transitions from a casino gaming destination to a general-interest tourist destination.
