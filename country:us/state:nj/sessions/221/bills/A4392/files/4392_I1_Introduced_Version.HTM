City Urban Enterprise Zone and Property Tax Relief Act, authorizes the
creation of an urban enterprise zone (zone or UEZ) in the city of Atlantic City for a one-time term of 10 years.  The bill requires designation of the
Atlantic City UEZ within 90 days of the date Atlantic City submits a UEZ

eligible business under the UEZ program, however, a business operating on
casino property which is not owned by a casino business may be eligible if it
otherwise meets the criteria for business eligibility.  </p>
