OPTION TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO ASSIST WITH APPLYING FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE LONG-TERM CARE BENEFITS: Relying on a non-attorney service might expose you and your family to unnecessary financial risk.  There are non-attorney agencies and companies which may offer to prepare and submit a Medicaid application.  These entities are not permitted to give legal advice or to implement legal strategies that may best protect your interests, and they are not obligated to advise you of your rights.  Moreover, these entities may have conflicts of interest, such as a financial relationship with the long-term care facility.  Federal law restricts these non-attorney services from charging a fee in connecting with a Medicaid application. New Jersey does not mandate that a Medicaid applicant obtain the assistance of an attorney when completing an application. You may, however, seek the assistance of an attorney who is knowledgeable about elder law and Medicaid eligibility rules.  If you wish to identify such an attorney, you may contact the State or local bar association attorney referral service. b.  A resident of a long-term care facility, or the residents representative, shall acknowledge receipt of the notice provided pursuant to subsection a. of this section by signing the bottom of the notice at the time of admission to the facility.  A copy of the signed notice shall be furnished to the resident or the residents representative, and a copy of the signed notice shall be retained by the long-term care facility for the duration of the residents stay at the facility. c.  The operator of a long-term facility shall prominently display the notice described in subsection a. of this section at the entrance to the facility and in such other locations as the department may require. d.  A person providing Medicaid application assistance to a resident or prospective resident of a long-term care facility shall, prior to providing any application assistance services to the resident or prospective resident, disclose any financial relationship between the application assistance provider and any long-term care facility, including financial relationships with any parent companies or subsidiaries of the long-term care facility.  The person providing Medicaid application assistance shall additionally advise that the resident or prospective resident has the right to seek the advice of an attorney prior to signing any legal documents. 5.  a.  The Commissioner of Health may adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to implement the provisions of this act. b.  The Commissioner of Human Services shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), establishing uniform standards of care for non-attorney individuals providing Medicaid application assistance, including, but not limited to: (1) defining who is permitted to act as a Medicaid application assistor before Medicaid agencies and the Office of Administrative Law; (2) outlining the scope and nature of the services that non-attorney Medicaid application assistors are authorized to provide; 1and1 (3) requiring Medicaid application assistors to complete training on:  Medicaid program rules; handling confidential financial and medical information; conflicts of interest; and what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law1[; and (4) prohibiting non-attorney Medicaid application assistors from charging any fee for providing Medicaid application assistance services]1. 6.  This act shall take effect immediately.
