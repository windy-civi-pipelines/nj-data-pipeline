of college. The commissioner may allow an applicant who does not meet the
two-year college requirement to substitute, on a year for year basis, full-time
experience or the equivalent part-time experience in a position involving
municipal land use, planning, and zoning.  The commissioner, by rule and
regulation, may establish additional requirements for certification that the
commissioner determines to be reasonable and appropriate to further the
professionalism of the position of zoning officer and land use board
administrator.  Each completed application shall be accompanied by a fee in the
amount of $50 payable to the State Treasurer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would
professionalize the positions of zoning officer and land use board
administrator by establishing a certification program for the positions. A zoning
officer is defined in the bill as the designated administrative officer in the
Municipal Land Use Law authorized to issue permits, certificates, or
authorizations under that statute. The land-use development process in New
Jersey is extremely complicated as governed by the Municipal Land Use Law and a
myriad of other local laws and State statutes. However, currently, an
individual may assume the position of zoning officer or land use board
administrator in a municipality without any background or experience.  This
absence of threshold requirements for these important municipal positions
stands in stark contrast to other essential municipal positions, such as
municipal clerk, municipal finance officer, tax assessor, tax collector,
construction code official and subcode officials, registrar, and public works
manager, where State certifications are required. In addition, in some
circumstances, individuals assume responsibilities in more than one
municipality, resulting in potential conflicts that make it difficult or
impossible for the individual to satisfactorily perform duties in multiple
employments. By establishing minimum qualifications for employment as a zoning
officer or land use board administrator and by subjecting those seeking
multiple employments to independent scrutiny and control, the municipalities
and residents of this State will be better served. The bill will benefit both
an applicant and the municipality by ensuring that the officers responsible for
managing land-use development have the skills, knowledge and time necessary to
effectively implement local zoning and development ordinances.  The end result
will be a more predictable and reliable process Statewide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, after a
transition period of at least two years, a person would not be appointed,
reappointed, or continue to serve as a zoning officer, or land use board
administrator, unless that person has been issued a zoning officer or land use
board administrator certificate by the Department of Community Affairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Commissioner of Community
Affairs would be required to establish a certification program for zoning
officers and land use board administrators within six months of the effective
date of the bill.  The bill would establish minimum standards for applicants
seeking certification, including: at least 21 years of age, United States
Citizenship, good moral character, and a high school diploma or its
equivalent.  An application for certification would also have to demonstrate
completion of at least two years of education at a college of recognized
standing, or in lieu thereof, relevant work experience, as well as completion
of a course of study in planning and zoning administration and enforcement.  
The bill would also allow the commissioner to establish additional requirements
for certification that the commissioner determines to be reasonable and
appropriate to further the professionalism of the positions of zoning officer
and land use board administrator.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
commissioner would establish standards for curriculum and administration of the
course of study in planning and zoning administration and in conjunction with
the New Jersey Association of Planning and Zoning Administrators, the New
Jersey Planning Officials, the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, and
the Center for Government Services at Rutgers, the State University of New
Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Certification would require at
least 40 hours of instruction designed to prepare an individual to perform the
duties of a zoning officer and at least 30 hours of instruction designed to
prepare an individual to perform the duties of land use board administrator,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would prohibit a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would empower the
commissioner to revoke or suspend a zoning officer or land use board
administrator certificate, after due notice and a proper hearing, if the holder
thereof engaged in dishonest practices, or willful or intentional failure,
neglect, or refusal to comply with the Constitution of the State of New Jersey
or laws relating to the duties of the zoning officer or land use board
administrator, or for other good cause.  If a zoning officer certificate or

removed from office by the commissioner, the office would be declared vacant,
and the person would not be eligible to hold that office, nor make application
for recertification, for a period of five years from the date of revocation.</p>
