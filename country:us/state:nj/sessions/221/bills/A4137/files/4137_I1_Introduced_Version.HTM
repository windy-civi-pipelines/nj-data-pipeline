<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would prohibit the
sale, offering for sale, distribution, importation, exportation, or other
propagation of certain invasive plant species in the State, except under a
valid permit issued by the Department of Agriculture (DOA), and it would
require the DOA to adopt rules and regulations establishing and implementing a
permitting program to facilitate the safe sale, import, export, introduction,
distribution, and propagation of regulated invasive species in the State.  The bill
would also establish, in the statutory law, with certain modifications, the New
Jersey Invasive Species Council (council) that was originally created by
Governor Corzines Executive Order No. 97 of 2004.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines
&quot;regulated invasive species&quot; to mean an invasive plant species, and
any non-hybrid sub-species, variety, cultivar, or other subcategory thereof,
which is included in a list of invasive species to be developed by the DOA
under the bill.  The bill would expressly exempt, from its prohibitions and
permitting requirements, certain plant cultivars and varieties of Chinese
Silvergrass, which have been deemed to be non-invasive, and it would further
authorize the department's rules and regulations to establish criteria for the
exemption, from the bill, of other cultivars, subspecies, and varieties of
ordinarily invasive plant species which are proven to be non-invasive, by
virtue of sterility factors or other unique and stable genetic traits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the DOA,
within one year after the bills effective date, to develop a list of the
regulated invasive species that are subject to the bills permitting
requirements.  Each year thereafter, the DOA would be required to update the
departmental list, as necessary to designate new species as regulated invasive
species for the bills purposes.  In order to designate a new plant species as
a regulated invasive species, the DOA would be required to find that the
species threatens, or has the potential to threaten, the ecological, cultural,
historical, or infrastructure resources of, or human health in, the State.  The
departments would not be authorized to designate a species as a regulated
invasive species solely on the basis that it is non-native to New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the
DOA's rules and regulations to incorporate labeling requirements for regulated
invasive species, permit application requirements, criteria for permit
approval, and a fee schedule.  The DOA would further be required, in
consultation with the Invasive Species Council and other relevant entities, as
deemed appropriate, to develop or provide physical and digital educational
materials, for distribution to consumers at the point of sale.  These materials
are to identify the States regulated invasive species, as well as the best
propagation, cultivation, and management practices to be used in order to
prevent the spread of a regulated invasive species, and, where applicable,
alternative species that can be more safely propagated in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person who violates the
bills provisions would be subject to a warning for a first offense and a civil
penalty of up to $1,000 for a second offense, up to $2,000 for a third offense,
and up to $5,000 for a fourth or subsequent offense.  Any violator would be
provided with a three-month period in which to remediate any violation before
being subjected to an enhanced penalty for a subsequent offense under the
bills provisions.  The DOA would also be authorized to seek injunctive relief,
as necessary to prevent an ongoing violation, and to seize and destroy any
invasive plant species that forms a basis of a violation.  The DOA would be
required to conduct nursery inspections, in a manner and form similar to
inspections for nursery stock conducted pursuant to law, to evaluate compliance
with the bills provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The New Jersey Invasive
Species Council, as established under the bill, would consist of a combination
of ex-officio members from State agencies and pubic members appointed by the
Governor.  The council would be charged with examining and revising the 2009
New Jersey Strategic Management Plan for Invasive Species, prepared by the New
Jersey Invasive Species Council pursuant to Executive Order No. 97 of 2004. 
The council would be required to submit the revised plan to the Governor and
the Legislature no later than two years after the effective date of the bill. 
The council would also be charged with the following duties:  (1) reviewing
comprehensive lists of invasive species and likely invasive species present in
New Jersey and the nearby states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut,
Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia for possible inclusion on the list; (2)
developing procedures for the addition of new species to the departmental list maintained
under the bill; (3) providing recommendations to the DOA regarding their
addition of new species to the list of regulated invasive species; and (4)
performing various other tasks related to the management of invasive species. 
The bill would exclude, from the councils responsibilities, the requirement 
present in Executive Order No. 97  to plan, design, and implement two invasive
species eradication and native plant restoration pilot projects.</p>
