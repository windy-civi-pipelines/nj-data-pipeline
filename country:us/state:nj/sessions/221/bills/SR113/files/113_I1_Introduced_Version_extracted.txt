SR113 SENATE RESOLUTION No. 113 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED OCTOBER 7, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  RAJ MUKHERJI District 32 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS Urges DEP to cease funding synthetic turf field projects and prioritize investing in natural grass playing fields. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Senate Resolution urging the Department of Environmental Protection to cease funding synthetic turf field projects and to prioritize investing in safe, non-toxic, natural grass playing fields for recreational development projects. Whereas, The Green Acres Program (Green Acres), housed under New Jerseys Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), was established in 1961 to meet the States growing recreation and conservation needs; and Whereas, Through grants and low interest loans, Green Acres has helped protect over 80,000 acres and has financed hundreds of recreational development projects throughout the State; and Whereas, Recreational development projects play a vital role in supporting the economic health of the State and creating and maintaining safe spaces for New Jersey residents to gather, play, and exercise; and Whereas, Reports that Green Acres invested approximately $10 million in projects installing or replacing synthetic turf playing fields in 2023, however, have raised serious concerns as synthetic turf is associated with environmental hazards and health and safety risks; and Whereas, Synthetic turf, also referred to as artificial turf, contains small, rubberized pellets typically made from used tires, which can break down into microplastics that may run off into streams during heavy rains, causing environmental contamination; and Whereas, Environmental pollution from microplastics can harm aquatic life and disrupt the States delicate ecosystem; and Whereas, Synthetic turf components are not only destructive to the environment but also contain a myriad of chemicals known to be harmful to humans, including carcinogens, neurotoxicants, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals; and Whereas, When exposed to direct sunlight, a synthetic turf fields surface temperature can become up to 72 degrees hotter than natural grass, increasing the surrounding air temperature and placing athletes at risk of dehydration, heat stress, burns, and heatstroke; and Whereas, In a 2022 technical memorandum, the DEP cautioned athletes to avoid extended strenuous exercise on synthetic turf fields in the summer months due to the risk of heat-illnesses; and Whereas, In addition to heat-related health risks, the rough surface of synthetic turf can cause abrasions, known as turf burn, and athletes are more likely to suffer noncontact lower-body injuries when playing on synthetic turf because of the lack of shock absorption; and Whereas, Public health experts, epidemiologists, and pediatricians, including the team at the Mount Sinai Childrens Environmental Health Center, recommend against installing synthetic turf fields, citing the potential safety hazards and risk of dangerous heat and chemical exposures; and Whereas, Natural grass is free of the health and environmental hazards associated with synthetic turf, and organic maintenance practices, including frequent aeration and mowing, soil testing, and use of organic fertilizers, can further mitigate environmental and health risks by eliminating the need for toxic pesticides; and Whereas, While synthetic turf is often touted as cost-effective, low-maintenance, and water-saving, this House believes the environmental, health, and safety risks greatly outweigh the intended benefits; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This House urges the Department of Environmental Protection to cease funding synthetic turf field projects and to prioritize investing in safe, non-toxic, natural grass playing fields for recreational development projects. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the Governor, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, and the Director of the Green Acres Program. STATEMENT This resolution urges the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to cease investing in synthetic turf field projects and to prioritize investing in safe, non-toxic, natural grass playing fields for recreational development projects. The Green Acres Program (Green Acres) was established to meet the States growing recreation and conservation needs.  Through grants and low interest loans, Green Acres has financed hundreds of recreation development projects throughout the State.  Recreational development projects play a vital role in the States economy and create and maintain safe spaces for New Jerseyans to gather, play, and exercise. However, reports that Green Acres invested nearly $10 million in synthetic turf playing field projects in 2023 have raised serious environmental and public health concerns.  Synthetic turf components contain hazardous chemicals and can break down into microplastics that contribute to environmental pollution.  Synthetic turf also presents health and safety risks as the surface of synthetic turf can become much hotter than natural grass, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses and injuries, and the lack of shock absorption in synthetic turf places athletes at greater risk of suffering lower-body injuries.  Due to the safety hazards and risks of dangerous heat and chemical exposures, experts recommend against installing synthetic turf playing fields. This House believes the environmental, health, and safety risks greatly outweigh the intended benefits of synthetic turf and urges DEP to prioritize funding recreational development projects that use safe, natural, and eco-conscious materials.
