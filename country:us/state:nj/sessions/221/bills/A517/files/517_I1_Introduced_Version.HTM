<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  (1)   For the
taxpayers privilege period beginning in calendar year 2014, a taxpayer shall
be allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945,
c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for the amount paid during the privilege period to purchase
and install an electric vehicle charging station which is used directly and exclusively
by the taxpayer in the taxpayers business, trade, or occupation.&nbsp; The
credit allowed pursuant to this paragraph shall be 25 percent of the amount
paid to purchase and install an electric vehicle charging station, up to $500
per station.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   For the taxpayers
privilege period beginning in calendar year 2015, a taxpayer shall be allowed a
credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162
(C.54:10A-5) for the amount paid during the privilege period to purchase and

per station.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1) To qualify for the
tax credit allowed pursuant to this section, the taxpayer shall file an
application for a certification from the Commissioner of Environmental
Protection that the charging station purchased by the taxpayer qualifies as an
electric vehicle charging station.  The application for certification shall
specifically indicate the date of purchase of the electric vehicle charging
station, a description of the vehicles to use the electric vehicle charging
station, the amount paid for the electric vehicle charging station, and proof
of completed installation of the charging station.  The commissioner shall
prescribe the form for the application and certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The Commissioner of
Environmental Protection shall have 90 days from the date of receipt of a
complete application to make a determination as to the issuance of a
certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Upon certification, the Commissioner
of Environmental Protection shall submit a copy thereof to the taxpayer and the
director.  In filing a tax return that includes a claim for the credit allowed
pursuant to this section, the taxpayer shall include a copy of the
certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The amount of the
credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5
of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), for a privilege period, when taken together
with any other credits allowed against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of
P.L.1945, c.162, shall not exceed 50% of the tax liability otherwise due and
shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum
provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162.  The priority in
which credits allowed pursuant to this section and any other credits shall be
taken shall be as determined by the Director of the Division of Taxation.  The
amount of the credit otherwise allowable under this section which cannot be
applied for the privilege period due to the limitations of this subsection or
under other provisions of P.L.1945, c.162 may be carried over, if necessary, to
the seven privilege periods following the privilege period for which the credit
was allowed.</p>
