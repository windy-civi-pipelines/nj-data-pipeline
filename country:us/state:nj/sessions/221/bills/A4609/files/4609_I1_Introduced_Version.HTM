Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Protecting Students from Obscene Material in School Libraries Act." 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     It is well established that boards of education possess significant discretion to determine the content of their school libraries. b.    School libraries, as centers for voluntary inquiry, provide students with the vital opportunity to engage in self-education and individual enrichment by providing students with access to a wide range of library material. c.     Obscene material, however, has no place in a school library. In fact, it is a criminal offense in the State for a person to knowingly distribute or exhibit obscene material to a child. d.    Boards of education are obligated to provide a safe learning environment for students.

STATEMENT This bill, entitled the "Protecting Students from Obscene Material in School Libraries Act," requires boards of education to safeguard students from obscene material in school libraries and against school employees who provide obscene materials to students in school libraries. This bill requires boards of education to adopt a policy regarding obscene material in school libraries.

The commissioner, in consultation with the State Librarian, is to develop and distribute to school districts guidance and resources regarding: (1)   examples of obscene material that are not to be included in a school library; (2)   information concerning when a board of education should refer an allegation of a violation of Obscenity For Persons Under 18 to law enforcement; (3)   recommended disciplinary actions against a school employee, which include termination of employment for a criminal conviction under Obscenity For Persons Under 18; and (4)   any other information the commissioner deems necessary.
