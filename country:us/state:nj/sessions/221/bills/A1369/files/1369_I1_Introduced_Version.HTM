A petition as provided in this section may be filed by any person or any association or agency, interested in such child in the circumstances set forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this section.  The division shall seek to be joined as a party to a petition filed to terminate the parental rights of a child in the care and custody of the division unless the division has established an exception to the requirement to seek termination of parental rights in accordance with section 31 of P.L.1999, c.53 (C.30:4C-15.3). Prior to filing or seeking to be joined as a party to a petition to terminate the parental rights of the parent of a child who has been found to have committed murder, aggravated manslaughter, or manslaughter of the other parent of the child, or to have aided or abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit such murder, aggravated manslaughter, or manslaughter, or to have committed, or attempted to commit, an assault or similarly serious act which resulted, or could have resulted, in the death or significant bodily injury to the other parent of the child pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the division may take into account whether the parent, at the time the offenses were committed, was a victim of domestic violence or reasonably believed that the parent was protecting himself or herself or the parents children against the use of unlawful force by the other parent. (cf: P.L. 2004, c.130, s.55) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, designated Addis Law, amends section 15 of P.L.1951, c.138 (C.30:4C-15) to make a parents conviction for the murder of a childs other parent grounds for termination of parental rights. Specifically, if the parent of a child has been found by a criminal court to have committed murder, aggravated manslaughter, or manslaughter of the childs other parent, to have aided or abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit the murder, aggravated manslaughter, or manslaughter, or to have committed, or attempted to commit, an assault or similarly serious act which resulted, or could have resulted, in the death or significant bodily injury to the childs other parent, the bill would require the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP) in the Department of Children and Families to file a petition to terminate the parents parental rights. Currently, the law requires DCPP to file a petition to terminate the parental rights of a parent who has been found by a criminal court to have committed murder, aggravated manslaughter, or manslaughter of another child of the parent, to have aided or abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit the murder, aggravated manslaughter, or manslaughter of the child or another child of the parent, or to have committed, or attempted to commit, an assault or similarly serious act which resulted, or could have resulted, in the death or significant bodily injury to the child or another child of the parent, but not if the offenses were committed against the childs other parent. Under the provisions of the bill, prior to filing or seeking to join as a party to a petition for the termination of parental rights of the parent of a child who has been found to have committed murder, aggravated manslaughter, or manslaughter of the childs other parent, or to have aided and abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit the murder, aggravated manslaughter, or manslaughter, or to have committed, or attempted to commit, an assault or similarly serious act which resulted, or could have resulted, in the death or significant bodily injury of the childs other parent, DCPP would be permitted to take into account whether the parent, at the time the offenses were committed, was a victim of domestic violence or reasonably believed that the parent was protecting himself or herself or the parents children against the use of unlawful force by the other parent. Current law requires DCPP to file or to seek to be joined as a party to a petition for termination of parental rights as soon as any of the circumstances set forth in the law are established, unless DCPP establishes an exception to the requirement to seek termination of parental rights in accordance with section 31 of P.L.1999, c.53 (C.30:4C-15.3).  The law does not require DCPP, at any time during the filing of a petition for termination of parental rights, to take into account whether the parent was a victim of domestic violence or believed that the parent was acting in self-defense or in defense of the parents children. This bill is named Addis Law, in honor of Merry Abernathy, a mother who was murdered by her partner. After the murder, Merrys partner tried to claim custody of their child, Addison. Addis Law is modeled after a North Carolina statute that allows the court to terminate the parental rights of a childs parent who has committed certain offenses (murder, manslaughter, conspiracy to commit murder or manslaughter, or assault resulting in death or significant bodily injury) against the childs other parent.
