(b)   This subsection e. shall apply to gain from the sale or exchange of stock treated as qualified small business stock by reason of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph only to the extent of the gain that would have been recognized at the time of the transfer described in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph if section 351 or 368 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.351 or s.368) had not applied at that time. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the stock that is treated as qualified small business stock by reason of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph is issued by a corporation that (as of the time of the transfer described in that subparagraph (a)) is a qualified small business. (c)   For purposes of this paragraph (4), stock treated as qualified small business stock under subparagraph (a) shall be so treated for subsequent transactions or reorganizations, except that the limitation of subparagraph (b) shall be applied as of the time of the first transfer to which the limitation applied (determined after the application of the second sentence of subparagraph (b)). (d)   In the case of a transaction described in section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.351), this paragraph shall apply only if immediately after the transaction the corporation issuing the stock owns directly or indirectly stock representing control (within the meaning of section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.368)) of the corporation whose stock was exchanged. h.    For purposes of this section: (1)   In the case in which the taxpayer transfers property (other than money or stock) to a corporation in exchange for stock in the corporation, the stock shall be treated as having been acquired by the taxpayer on the date of the exchange and the basis of the stock in the hands of the taxpayer shall in no event be less than the fair market value of the property exchanged. (2)   If the adjusted basis of any qualified small business stock is adjusted by reason of any contribution to capital after the date on which the stock was originally issued, in determining the amount of the adjustment by reason of the contribution, the basis of the contributed property shall in no event be treated as less than its fair market value on the date of the contribution. i.     (1) If the taxpayer has an offsetting short position with respect to any qualified small business stock, subsection a. shall not apply to any gain from the sale or exchange of the stock unless the stock was held by the taxpayer for more than five years as of the first day on which there was such a short position and the taxpayer elects to recognize gain as if the stock was sold on that first day for its fair market value. (2)   For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the taxpayer shall be treated as having an offsetting short position with respect to any qualified small business stock if any of the following apply: (a)   The taxpayer has made a short sale of substantially identical property. (b)   The taxpayer has acquired an option to sell substantially identical property at a fixed price. (c)   To the extent provided in regulations, the taxpayer has entered into any other transaction that substantially reduces the risk of loss from holding the qualified small business stock. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any reference to the taxpayer shall be treated as including a reference to any person who is related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.267(b) or s.707(b))) to the taxpayer. j.     A corporation that issues qualified small business stock agrees to submit reports to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury and to its shareholders as the director may require to carry out the purposes of this section. 2.    The Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury shall prescribe regulations pursuant to the provision of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act, including any regulations that may conform to those regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 1202(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.1202(k)) that shall apply to the extent that those regulations do not conflict with this act, and such further regulation that shall include but be not limited to regulations to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this act through splitups, shell corporations, partnerships, or otherwise. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows for a deduction from New Jersey gross income of capital gains from the sale or exchange of New Jersey qualified small business stock held for more than five years.  The deduction for these capital gains is modeled on the federal Internal Revenue Code capital gains exclusion for owners of Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) under section 1202 of the federal Internal Revenue Code.  The deduction under this bill will help promote investment in New Jersey based small and medium size companies that find it difficult to attract initial capital investors because these companies are usually not profitable for their first few years.  Generally, QSBS stock is originally issued C corporation stock held for at least 5 years in a corporation with no more than $50 million in assets at issuance.  This deduction will apply to C corporations established on and after the enactment of the bill.  No New Jersey gross income taxpayer will receive any capital gains benefit without holding the QSBS stock for at least 5 years. For individual taxpayer/investors to qualify for the special capital gains treatment under section 1202 and this New Jersey gross income tax deduction, the stock must be in a domestic C corporation (not an S corporation or LLC), and it must be a C corporation during substantially all the time the individual holds the stock. The C corporation may not have more than $50 million in assets as of the date the stock was issued and immediately thereafter.  The individual taxpayer/investor must acquire the stock at its original issue and not from a secondary market.  Moreover, during substantially all the time the stock is held, at least 80% of the value of the corporations assets must be used in the active conduct of one or more qualified businesses.  Active conduct of one or more qualified businesses cannot be an investment vehicle or inactive business.  As under section 1202, the New Jersey gross income tax deduction of capital gains of the sale or exchange of QSBS cannot be stock in a business that is: a service business in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, or brokerage services; a banking, insurance, financing, leasing, investing, or similar business; a farming business; a business of operating a hotel, motel, restaurant, or similar business. If the individual taxpayer/investor holds qualifying stock for at least five years, then the individual taxpayer/investor would be able to exclude the capital gains made on the disposition of the stock, and thus pay no gross income on the capital gains.  The special exclusion of capital gains for qualified stock that is held by pass through entities, that include a partnership, an S corporation, a regulated investment company, or a common trust fund, that otherwise meet the requirements of this bill, is available to the individual gross income taxpayers who hold interests in those pass-through entities.  The bill limits the aggregate amount of excludable capital gains for a taxable year, in the case of one or more dispositions of QSBS by a taxpayer, to the greater of $10 million, reduced by the aggregate amount of eligible gain taken into account by the taxpayer for prior taxable years and attributable to dispositions of QSBS, or ten times the aggregate adjusted basis of QSBS issued by the corporation and disposed of by the taxpayer during the taxable year.  The QSBS must have been acquired in exchange for money or property, or as compensation for services provided to the corporation.  At least 80% of the corporation's payroll, as measured by total dollar value, must be attributable to employment located within New Jersey.

(2)   If the adjusted basis of any qualified small business stock is adjusted by reason of any contribution to capital after the date on which the stock was originally issued, in determining the amount of the adjustment by reason of the contribution, the basis of the contributed property shall in no event be treated as less than its fair market value on the date of the contribution. i.     (1) If the taxpayer has an offsetting short position with respect to any qualified small business stock, subsection a. shall not apply to any gain from the sale or exchange of the stock unless the stock was held by the taxpayer for more than five years as of the first day on which there was such a short position and the taxpayer elects to recognize gain as if the stock was sold on that first day for its fair market value.

STATEMENT This bill allows for a deduction from New Jersey gross income of capital gains from the sale or exchange of New Jersey qualified small business stock held for more than five years.  The deduction for these capital gains is modeled on the federal Internal Revenue Code capital gains exclusion for owners of Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) under section 1202 of the federal Internal Revenue Code.  The deduction under this bill will help promote investment in New Jersey based small and medium size companies that find it difficult to attract initial capital investors because these companies are usually not profitable for their first few years.  Generally, QSBS stock is originally issued C corporation stock held for at least 5 years in a corporation with no more than $50 million in assets at issuance.  This deduction will apply to C corporations established on and after the enactment of the bill.  No New Jersey gross income taxpayer will receive any capital gains benefit without holding the QSBS stock for at least 5 years. For individual taxpayer/investors to qualify for the special capital gains treatment under section 1202 and this New Jersey gross income tax deduction, the stock must be in a domestic C corporation (not an S corporation or LLC), and it must be a C corporation during substantially all the time the individual holds the stock. The C corporation may not have more than $50 million in assets as of the date the stock was issued and immediately thereafter.  The individual taxpayer/investor must acquire the stock at its original issue and not from a secondary market.  Moreover, during substantially all the time the stock is held, at least 80% of the value of the corporations assets must be used in the active conduct of one or more qualified businesses.  Active conduct of one or more qualified businesses cannot be an investment vehicle or inactive business.  As under section 1202, the New Jersey gross income tax deduction of capital gains of the sale or exchange of QSBS cannot be stock in a business that is: a service business in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, or brokerage services; a banking, insurance, financing, leasing, investing, or similar business; a farming business; a business of operating a hotel, motel, restaurant, or similar business. If the individual taxpayer/investor holds qualifying stock for at least five years, then the individual taxpayer/investor would be able to exclude the capital gains made on the disposition of the stock, and thus pay no gross income on the capital gains.  The special exclusion of capital gains for qualified stock that is held by pass through entities, that include a partnership, an S corporation, a regulated investment company, or a common trust fund, that otherwise meet the requirements of this bill, is available to the individual gross income taxpayers who hold interests in those pass-through entities.  The bill limits the aggregate amount of excludable capital gains for a taxable year, in the case of one or more dispositions of QSBS by a taxpayer, to the greater of $10 million, reduced by the aggregate amount of eligible gain taken into account by the taxpayer for prior taxable years and attributable to dispositions of QSBS, or ten times the aggregate adjusted basis of QSBS issued by the corporation and disposed of by the taxpayer during the taxable year.  The QSBS must have been acquired in exchange for money or property, or as compensation for services provided to the corporation.  At least 80% of the corporation's payroll, as measured by total dollar value, must be attributable to employment located within New Jersey.
