New Jersey Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of N.J.S.54A:5-1, a taxpayer who is an individual shall be allowed
to deduct from the taxpayer's gross income in a taxable year the eligible gain
from the sale or exchange of New Jersey qualified small business stock held for
more than five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1) If the taxpayer has
eligible gain for the taxable year from one or more dispositions of stock
issued by any corporation, the aggregate amount of the gain from dispositions
of stock issued by the corporation which may be taken into account under
subsection a. for the taxable year shall not exceed the greater of either of
the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   Ten million dollars
($10,000,000) reduced by the aggregate amount of eligible gain taken into
account by the taxpayer under subsection a. for prior taxable years and
attributable to dispositions of stock issued by the corporation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Ten times the aggregate
adjusted bases of qualified small business stock issued by the corporation and
disposed of by the taxpayer during the taxable year.  For purposes of this
subparagraph (b), the adjusted basis of any stock shall be determined without
regard to any addition to basis after the date on which the stock was
originally issued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   For purposes of this
subsection b., the term eligible gain means any gain from the sale or
exchange of qualified small business stock held for more than five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   (a)  In the case of a
married individual filing a separate return, subparagraph (a) of paragraph (1)
of this subsection shall be five million dollars ($5,000,000).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   In the case of a married
taxpayer filing a joint return, the amount of gain taken into account under
subsection a. shall be allocated equally between the spouses for purposes of applying
this subsection to subsequent taxable years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     As used in this
section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Qualified small
business stock means any stock in a C corporation which is originally issued
after the effective date of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill), if both of the following apply:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   As of the date of
issuance, the corporation is a qualified small business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Except as provided in
subsections e. and g., the stock is acquired by the taxpayer at its original
issue (directly or through an underwriter) in either of the following manners:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    In exchange for money
or other property (not including stock).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   As compensation for
services provided to the corporation (other than services performed as an
underwriter of the stock).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   (a) Stock in a
corporation shall not be treated as qualified small business stock unless,
during substantially all of the taxpayers holding period for the stock, the
corporation meets the active business requirements of subsection d. of this section
and the corporation is a C corporation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   (i) Notwithstanding
subsection d. of this section, a corporation shall be treated as meeting the
active business requirements of subsection d. for any period during which the
corporation qualifies as a specialized small business investment company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   For purposes of
subsubparagraph (i) of this subparagraph, the term specialized small business
investment company means any eligible corporation (as defined in paragraph (4)
of subsection d. of this section) that is licensed to operate under Section
301(d) of the federal Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (as in effect on
May 13, 1993).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   (a) Stock acquired by
the taxpayer shall not be treated as qualified small business stock if, at any
time during the four-year period beginning on the date two years before the
issuance of the stock, the corporation issuing the stock purchased (directly or
indirectly) any of its stock from the taxpayer or from a related person to the
taxpayer.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, &quot;related person&quot;
means a corporation, partnership, association or trust controlled by the
taxpayer; an individual, corporation, partnership, association or trust that is
in the control of the taxpayer; a corporation, partnership, association or
trust controlled by an individual, corporation, partnership, association or
trust that is in the control of the taxpayer; or a member of the same
controlled group as the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Stock issued by a
corporation shall not be treated as qualified small business stock if, during
the two-year period beginning on the date one year before the issuance of the
stock, the corporation made one or more purchases of its stock with an
aggregate value (as of the time of the respective purchases) exceeding five percent
of the aggregate value of all of its stock as of the beginning of the two-year
period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   If any transaction is
treated under section 304(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.304(a))
as a distribution in redemption of the stock of any corporation, for purposes
of subparagraphs (a) and (b), the corporation shall be treated as purchasing an

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill allows for a deduction
from New Jersey gross income of capital gains from the sale or exchange of New
Jersey qualified small business stock held for more than five years.  The
deduction for these capital gains is modeled on the federal Internal Revenue
Code capital gains exclusion for owners of Qualified Small Business Stock
(QSBS) under section 1202 of the federal Internal Revenue Code.  The deduction
under this bill will help promote investment in New Jersey based small and
medium size companies that find it difficult to attract initial capital
investors because these companies are usually not profitable for their first
few years.  Generally, QSBS stock is originally issued C corporation stock held
for at least 5 years in a corporation with no more than $50 million in assets
at issuance.  This deduction will apply to C corporations established on and
after the enactment of the bill.  No New Jersey gross income taxpayer will
receive any capital gains benefit without holding the QSBS stock for at least 5
years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For individual
taxpayer/investors to qualify for the special capital gains treatment under
section 1202 and this New Jersey gross income tax deduction, the stock must be
in a domestic C corporation (not an S corporation or LLC), and it must be a C
corporation during substantially all the time the individual holds the stock. 
The C corporation may not have more than $50 million in assets as of the date
the stock was issued and immediately thereafter.  The individual
taxpayer/investor must acquire the stock at its original issue and not from a
secondary market.  Moreover, during substantially all the time the stock is
held, at least 80% of the value of the corporations assets must be used in the
active conduct of one or more qualified businesses.  Active conduct of one or
more qualified businesses cannot be an investment vehicle or inactive
business.  As under section 1202, the New Jersey gross income tax deduction of
capital gains of the sale or exchange of QSBS cannot be stock in a business
that is: a service business in the fields of health, law, engineering,
architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting,
athletics, financial services, or brokerage services; a banking, insurance,
financing, leasing, investing, or similar business; a farming business; a
business of operating a hotel, motel, restaurant, or similar business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the individual
taxpayer/investor holds qualifying stock for at least five years, then the
individual taxpayer/investor would be able to exclude the capital gains made on
the disposition of the stock, and thus pay no gross income on the capital
gains.  The special exclusion of capital gains for qualified stock that is held
by pass through entities, that include a partnership, an S corporation, a
regulated investment company, or a common trust fund, that otherwise meet the
requirements of this bill, is available to the individual gross income
taxpayers who hold interests in those pass-through entities.  The bill limits
the aggregate amount of excludable capital gains for a taxable year, in the
case of one or more dispositions of QSBS by a taxpayer, to the greater of $10
million, reduced by the aggregate amount of eligible gain taken into account by
the taxpayer for prior taxable years and attributable to dispositions of QSBS,
or ten times the aggregate adjusted basis of QSBS issued by the corporation and
disposed of by the taxpayer during the taxable year.  The QSBS must have been
acquired in exchange for money or property, or as compensation for services
provided to the corporation.  At least 80% of the corporation's payroll, as
measured by total dollar value, must be attributable to employment located
within New Jersey.</p>
