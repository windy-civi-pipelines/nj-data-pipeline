<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    This act shall take
effect on the 90th day next following the date of enactment, except that the
State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners shall take anticipatory
administrative action in advance thereof as may be necessary for the
implementation of section 1 of this act, and the Director of the Division of
Consumer Affairs shall take anticipatory administrative action in advance
thereof as may be necessary for the implementation of sections 2 through 4 of
this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would impose certain
requirements to better ensure that prescription drugs issued by a veterinarian,
for the treatment of an animal, are not misused, abused, or subject to
diversion by the humans who have control over those drugs.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would amend the
States veterinarian practice laws to specify that, whenever a veterinarian
prescribes a medication for use by an animal:  (1) the prescription is to be
issued in the name of the animal owner; and (2) the prescription blank must
identify both the name of the animal owner and the name of the animal that is
to be administered the prescribed medication.  Only the person who is named on
the prescription blank will be authorized to possess the drug for the purposes
of administering it to the identified animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event that an animal is
jointly owned by multiple owners, and more than one of the owners wishes to
engage in administration of the drug to the animal, the bill would require the
prescribing veterinarian, upon request, to list the names of each such owner on
the prescription blank.  In such a case, the bill would authorize the
dispensation of the drug to any of the owners listed on the prescription blank,
and it would further authorize any of those identified owners to possess the
drugs for the purposes of administering it to the animal.  Except in the case
of authorized prescription refills, nothing in the bills provisions would authorize
an animal owner to fill a prescription, if the prescription has already been
filled by a co-owner on a previous occasion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Owner is defined by the
bill, in a manner consistent with the States animal laws, to mean an
individual who has a right of property in an animal, or who has an animal in
their keeping, at the time when veterinary care is sought for the animal.  The
term includes any private citizen, such as a pet owner, animal foster care
parent, or private animal rescuer, who is providing a temporary or permanent
home for the animal at the time when veterinary care is sought; or the owner,
operator, or designated employee of a pet shop, pound, kennel, animal shelter,
animal boarding facility, or animal rescue facility where the animal is being temporarily
housed at the time when veterinary care is sought. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require a
veterinarian to review relevant prescription monitoring information under the
States Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) before prescribing any controlled
dangerous substance for use in the treatment of an animal.  The bill would
amend the States PMP law to expressly clarify that veterinarians are
authorized to access PMP information for the purposes of providing care or
treatment to an animal, and for the purposes of verifying information related
to a veterinary client.  The bill would also expressly authorize a veterinarian
to provide any certified veterinary aides employed thereby with delegated
authority to access PMP information for these purposes.  Certified veterinary
aide is defined to include certified veterinary technicians and Approved
Veterinary Assistants.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever a veterinarian
prescribes a controlled dangerous substance for use by an animal, the pharmacy
permit holder dispensing the prescription drug will be required under the bill
to submit certain information about the veterinary client (i.e., the animal
owner) to the Prescription Monitoring Program.  In particular, the pharmacy
permit holder is required to submit the surname, first name, date of birth,
street address, and telephone number of the veterinary client/animal owner
identified on the prescription blank, as well as the name and approximate age
of the animal for whom the controlled dangerous substance was prescribed.  The
pharmacy permit holder is also required to submit identifying information about
any other individual who attempts to pick up an animals prescription, if the
pharmacist has a reasonable belief that that person may be seeking the drug for
any reason other than delivering the substance to the animal for the treatment
of an existing medical condition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill further amends the
PMP law to authorize:  (1) a veterinary client to request the clients own
prescription monitoring information from a veterinarian; (2) a veterinarian, or
a certified veterinary aide employed thereby, to provide such requested
information to the client; and (3) a veterinary client to ask a pharmacy permit
holder to correct any information that was inaccurately entered into the
system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also amend the
PMP law to authorize the division to allow a law enforcement officer or an
authorized representative of a state program to access PMP information when
engaged in a bona fide investigation of a veterinary client.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would make
minor technical corrections to the PMP law.</p>
