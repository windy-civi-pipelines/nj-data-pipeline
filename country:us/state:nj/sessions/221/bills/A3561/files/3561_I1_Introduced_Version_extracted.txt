Doxxing is a crime of the fourth degree unless the disclosure results in any serious bodily injury, physical harm, or stalking, at which time it becomes a crime of the third degree.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  A crime of the third degree is punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.
