Section 1:
S3278 SENATE, No. 3278 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 16, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  TROY SINGLETON District 7 (Burlington) SYNOPSIS Extends permission to administer glucagon and blood glucose tests to EMTs. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning EMTs, glucagon administration, and blood glucose testing, and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  As used in this act: "Commissioner" means the Commissioner of Health. Emergency glucagon means a medication used when a person with diabetes is experiencing severe hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, and cannot take sugar orally.  Once injected the medication raises the injected persons blood sugar. "Emergency medical technician" means a person trained in basic life support services as defined in section 1 of P.L.1985, c.351 (C.26:2K-21) and who is certified by the Department of Health to provide that level of care. Glucagon means a hormone that the human body produces to prevent low blood sugar, which comes in several forms including a nasal spray, auto-injectors, prefilled syringes, or a powder that must be mixed with a liquid before injecting. 2.    a.  The commissioner shall establish written standards and application procedures which an emergency medical technician shall meet in order to obtain certification to administer glucagon and blood glucose tests.  The commissioner shall certify a candidate who: (1)  provides evidence of satisfactory completion of an educational program which is approved by the commissioner and includes training in the administration of blood glucose tests and emergency glucagon using an auto-injector device; and (2)  passes an examination in the administration of a blood glucose test and emergency glucagon using an auto-injector device, as approved by the commissioner. b.  An emergency medical technician who has been certified by the commissioner pursuant to subsection a. of this section to administer emergency glucagon using an auto-injector device shall administer, maintain, and dispose of the device in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner. c.     The commissioner shall maintain a registry of all persons certified pursuant to this section, which shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   the person's name and residence; and (2)   the date that certification was granted. d.    The commissioner shall annually compile a list of emergency medical technicians who have obtained certification to administer blood glucose tests and emergency glucagon using an auto-injector device pursuant to this section, which shall be available to the public. e.     A fee may be charged to a person enrolled in an educational program approved by the department which includes training in the administration of blood glucose tests and emergency glucagon using an auto-injector device in order to cover the cost of training and testing for certification pursuant to this section, if the entity that provides the educational program is not reimbursed for the cost of that training and testing from the "Emergency Medical Technician Training Fund" established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1992, c.143 (C.26:2K-56). 3.  The Commissioner of Health may adopt rules and regulations, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), if necessary to effectuate the provisions of this act. 4.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the sixth month after enactment. STATEMENT This bill extends permission to emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to administer glucagon and blood glucose tests.  Glucagon is a hormone that the human body produces to prevent low blood sugar.  In people with diabetes, this natural production is not enough during severe hypoglycemia.  Emergency glucagon is a medication used when a person with diabetes is experiencing severe hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, and cannot take sugar orally.  Once injected, glucagon raises the blood sugar.  Glucagon comes in several forms including a nasal spray, auto-injectors, prefilled syringes, or a powder that must be mixed with a liquid before injecting. Mobile intensive care paramedics, persons trained in advanced life support services, who are licensed by the Commissioner of Health to render such services as part of a mobile intensive care unit, are permitted to administer glucagon and blood glucose tests, while emergency medical technicians, persons trained in basic life support services, who are certified by the Department of Health to perform these services, do not have similar permission.  Allowing EMTs to administer glucagon and blood glucose tests would help to mitigate potentially life threatening complications in patients needing emergency glucagon intervention.
