AR57 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 57 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  GERRY SCHARFENBERGER District 13 (Monmouth) Assemblywoman  VICTORIA A. FLYNN District 13 (Monmouth) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblymen McClellan, Simonsen, Assemblywomen Dunn, Matsikoudis, Assemblymen Sauickie, Clifton, DiMaio, Bergen, Torrissi, DePhillips, Auth, Peterson, McGuckin, Inganamort, Assemblywoman Fantasia, Assemblymen Kanitra, Azzariti Jr., Myhre, Rumpf and Barlas SYNOPSIS Urges immediate moratorium on sonar testing and wind turbine mapping due to recent unexplained deaths of marine life off the coast of New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Assembly Resolution urging an immediate moratorium on sonar testing and wind turbine mapping off the coast of New Jersey. Whereas, There are multiple offshore wind energy projects under development off the coast of New Jersey; and Whereas, On March 6, 2023, the Board of Public Utilities decided to solicit applications for even more offshore wind energy projects; and Whereas, Development of these offshore wind energy projects has resulted in the increased use of sonar and other underwater mapping technologies; and Whereas, The increased use of sonar and other underwater mapping technologies has the significant risk of interfering with marine mammals ability to hear, communicate, and navigate underwater; and Whereas, At the same time, there has been an unusual and significant increase in the number of deaths of whales and dolphins off the coast of New Jersey; and Whereas, Since December 1, 2022, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has recorded at least twelve deaths of whales off the coast of New Jersey, eight of which have been humpback whales; and Whereas, In addition to whales, there were at least five recorded deaths of dolphins in February 2023 alone; and Whereas, The deaths of these whales and dolphins are largely unexplained and remain under investigation; and Whereas, Nevertheless, these whale and dolphin deaths occurred in or near areas of offshore wind energy development; and Whereas, The multiple and unprecedented occurrence of whale and dolphin deaths in or near areas of offshore wind energy development may be more than coincidental and warrants investigation by the State and federal governments; and Whereas, Numerous residents, businesses, environmental groups, and elected officials along the coast of New Jersey have expressed strong concern regarding the connection between this States offshore wind energy projects and the recent unexplained deaths of whales and dolphins; and Whereas, Notwithstanding the salutary benefits offered by renewable offshore wind energy, the development of these projects should not come at the expense of marine life; and Whereas, The development of offshore wind energy projects off the coast of New Jersey should therefore be paused while further scientific study of these projects impact on marine life is conducted; and Whereas, The Department of Environmental Protection and the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management within the U.S. Department of the Interior are the agencies primarily charged with regulating these offshore wind energy projects; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. The General Assembly of the State of New Jersey urges the Department of Environmental Protection and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management within the U.S. Department of the Interior to impose an immediate moratorium on sonar testing and wind turbine mapping off the coast of New Jersey, due to the recent unexplained deaths of whales and dolphins off the coast of New Jersey. 2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Governor, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, the President of the United States, and the U.S. Secretary of the Interior. STATEMENT This resolution urges the State and federal governments to impose an immediate moratorium on sonar testing and wind turbine mapping due to recent unexplained deaths of whales and dolphins off the coast of New Jersey. Since December 2022, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has recorded at least twelve whale deaths off the coast of New Jersey, eight of which have been humpback whales.  In addition, there were also five deaths of dolphins recorded in February 2023 alone. Most of these deaths remain unexplained, but have occurred in or near areas of offshore wind energy development.  Given the unprecedented number of these recent deaths, their occurrence in or near areas of offshore wind energy development may be more than coincidental and warrants State and federal investigation. A possible cause of these deaths is the increased use of sonar and other underwater mapping technologies for the development of offshore wind energy projects, which may interfere with marine mammals ability to hear, communicate, and navigate underwater. Therefore, an immediate moratorium on sonar testing and wind turbine mapping for these offshore wind energy projects is urged, so that further scientific study of these projects impact on marine life can be conducted.
