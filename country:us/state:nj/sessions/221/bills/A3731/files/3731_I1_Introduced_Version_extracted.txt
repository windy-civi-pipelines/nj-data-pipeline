Whenever a contracting unit shall determine that a bid was not arrived at independently in open competition pursuant to subsection (3) of this section it shall thereupon notify the county prosecutor of the county in which the contracting unit is located and the Attorney General of the facts upon which its determination is based, and when appropriate, it may institute appropriate proceedings in any State or federal court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of any State or federal antitrust law or laws relating to the unlawful restraint of trade.

(5)  Notwithstanding any provision of law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, the subject matter consists of the combined collection and marketing, or the cooperative combined collection and marketing of recycled material recovered through a recycling program, or any product intentionally produced or derived from solid waste received at a resource recovery facility or recovered through a resource recovery program including, but not limited to, refuse-derived fuel, compost materials, methane gas, and other similar products, provided that in lieu of engaging in public advertising for bids and the bidding therefor, the contracting unit shall, prior to commencing the procurement process, submit for approval to the Director of the Division of Local Government Services, a written detailed description of the process to be followed in securing the services.  Within 30 days after receipt of the written description the director shall, if the director finds that the process provides for fair competition and integrity in the negotiation process, approve, in writing, the description submitted by the contracting unit.  If the director finds that the process does not provide for fair competition and integrity in the negotiation process, the director shall advise the contracting unit of the deficiencies that must be remedied.  If the director fails to respond in writing to the contracting unit within 30 days, the procurement process as described shall be deemed approved. As used in this section, "collection" means the physical removal of recyclable materials from curbside or any other location selected by the contracting unit. (6)  Notwithstanding any provision of law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, the contract is for the provision of electricity by a contracting unit engaged in the distribution of electricity for retail sale, for the provision of wholesale electricity by a municipal shared services energy authority as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2015, c.129 (C.40A:66-3), or for the provision of administrative or dispatching services related to the transmission of electricity, provided that in lieu of engaging in public advertising for bids and the bidding therefor, the contracting unit shall, prior to commencing the procurement process, submit for approval to the Director of the Division of Local Government Services, a written detailed description of the process to be followed in securing these services.  The process shall be designed in a way that is appropriate to and commensurate with industry practices, and the integrity of the government contracting process.  Within 30 days after receipt of the written description, the director shall, if the director finds that the process provides for fair competition and integrity in the negotiation process, approve, in writing, the description submitted by the contracting unit.  If the director finds that the process does not provide for fair competition and integrity in the negotiation process, the director shall advise the contracting unit of the deficiencies that must be remedied.  If the director fails to respond in writing to the contracting unit within 30 days, the procurement process, as submitted to the director pursuant to this section, shall be deemed approved. (cf: P.L.2017, c.131, s.174) 10.  (New section)    There is appropriated from the General Fund $2.5 million to the Domestic Violence Victim Notification Fund created by section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Following the expiration of the four-year pilot program established by P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), any unexpended funds shall be returned to the General Fund. 11.  (New section)    Not later than one year following the implementation of the pilot program, and annually thereafter for a total of four years, the Attorney General shall submit to the Governor and to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), a report containing an evaluation of the pilot program. The report shall recommend whether the pilot program should be continued as a Statewide program. 12.  (New section)    The Attorney General, in conjunction with the Administrative Office of the Courts, Division of Probation Services, and the State Parole Board, and in consultation with the Ocean County Prosecutor and Ocean County Sheriff and any other entities that the Attorney General deems necessary, shall promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of  P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 13.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire upon submission of the fourth annual report to the Governor and Legislature pursuant to section 11 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). STATEMENT This bill establishes a four-year pilot program in Ocean County for electronic monitoring of certain domestic violence offenders and notification to victims. The pilot program would be designated as Lisas Law in remembrance of Letizia Zindell of Toms River, a domestic violence victim murdered by her former fiancée. The pilot program would be ordered only with the victims informed consent and would apply to defendants convicted of contempt of a domestic violence order entered pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et al.) or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.). The bill provides that the court may, in making the determination whether to place the defendant on electronic monitoring, hold a hearing to consider the likelihood that the defendant's participation in electronic monitoring would deter the defendant from injuring the victim. The court would consider the following factors: the gravity and seriousness of harm that the defendant inflicted on the victim; the defendants previous history of domestic violence and other criminal acts, if any; whether the defendant has access to a weapon; and whether the defendant has threatened suicide or homicide or has a history of mental illness or substance abuse. This bill requires that any electronic monitoring device and tracking system worn or utilized by a defendant be in compliance with Offender Tracking Systems NIJ Standard 1004.00, issued by the National Institute of Justice in July 2016, and any successor standards adopted by the National Institute of Justice.  The NIJ Standard encompasses protocols for performance, safety, software requirements, and testing of electronic monitoring devices. The National Institute of Justice is the research, development, and evaluation agency of the United States Department of Justice. Under the bill, a defendant ordered by the court to be placed on electronic monitoring may be ordered to pay the costs and expenses related to electronic monitoring and victim notification or a portion of the costs and expenses, based on the defendants ability to pay. In addition, the defendant would be assessed a monitoring fee of $250. The court could waive the fee in cases of extreme financial hardship. The fee would be forwarded to the Domestic Violence Victim Notification Fund established under the bill. This fund, a dedicated, non-lapsing fund within the General Fund, would be administered by the Attorney General. The fund is to be the depository of the costs and expenses imposed on the defendant and any other monies that may be available to the fund through appropriation by the Legislature or any public or private source. All moneys deposited in the fund would be used to defray the costs of the pilot program. The bill provides that when a defendant is convicted of contempt of a domestic violence order the court may, in addition to or in lieu of any other disposition: (1)   sentence the defendant to electronic monitoring with victim notification; or (2)   sentence the defendant to probation or a suspension of sentence and, as a condition of such probation or suspension, order electronic monitoring with victim notification. The bill would also make it a crime of the third degree to tamper with, remove, or vandalize an electronic monitoring device. A crime of the third degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of three to five years or a fine of up to $15,000 or both. The bill requires the victim to be given the following information before providing informed consent: (1) information concerning the victim's right to refuse to participate in electronic monitoring and the process for requesting the court to terminate the victim's participation after it has been ordered; (2) the manner in which the electronic monitoring technology functions and the risks and limitations of that technology, the operational procedures of the device and the applicable instructions regarding the device, and the extent to which the system will track and record the victim's location and movements; (3) the boundaries imposed on the defendant during the electronic monitoring; (4) the sanctions that the court may impose on the defendant for violating a court order; (5) the procedure that the victim is to follow if the defendant violates an order or if the electronic monitoring equipment fails; (6) identification of support services available to assist the victim in developing a safety plan; (7) identification of community services available to assist the victim in obtaining shelter, counseling, child care, legal representation and other assistance; and (8) the non-confidential nature of the victims communications with the court concerning electronic monitoring and the restrictions to be imposed upon the defendants movements. The bill also provides for the following civil penalties which would expire at the end of the fifth year following implementation of the pilot program: (1) any person found by the court in a final domestic violence hearing to have committed an act of domestic violence is to be required to pay a civil penalty of $200, similar to the monitoring fee this penalty may be waived in cases of extreme financial hardship; and (2) in addition to any other disposition, the court would impose a civil penalty of $250 on any person convicted of a crime or offense involving domestic violence, or convicted of contempt of a domestic violence order, unless the person was previously assessed the $250 monitoring fee. The bill further provides that no supplier of a product, system, or service used for electronic monitoring with victim notification in the pilot program would be liable, directly or indirectly, for damages arising from any injury or death associated with the use of the product, system or service unless, and only to the extent that, such action is based on a claim that the injury or death was proximately caused by a manufacturing defect in the product or system. The bill also amends the Local Public Contracts Law, P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.), to provide that services and equipment necessary for the implementation of the pilot program could be negotiated and awarded by a governing body without public advertising for bids and bidding, and be awarded by resolution of the governing body. The bill appropriates $2.5 million from the General Fund to the Domestic Violence Victim Notification Fund, and provides that following the expiration of the four-year pilot program, any unexpended funds are to be returned to the General Fund. The bill provides that not later than one year following the implementation of the pilot program and annually thereafter for four years, the Attorney General is to submit a report to the Governor and Legislature containing an evaluation of the pilot program with a recommendation as to whether it should be continued as a Statewide program. In addition, the bill requires the Attorney General, in consultation with the Administrative Office of the Courts, to develop procedures to determine, investigate, and report on a 24-hour-per-day basis a defendant's noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the electronic monitoring program.  All reports of noncompliance would be investigated by a law enforcement officer within a reasonable period of time.

Whenever a contracting unit shall determine that a bid was not arrived at independently in open competition pursuant to subsection (3) of this section it shall thereupon notify the county prosecutor of the county in which the contracting unit is located and the Attorney General of the facts upon which its determination is based, and when appropriate, it may institute appropriate proceedings in any State or federal court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of any State or federal antitrust law or laws relating to the unlawful restraint of trade.

(5)  Notwithstanding any provision of law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, the subject matter consists of the combined collection and marketing, or the cooperative combined collection and marketing of recycled material recovered through a recycling program, or any product intentionally produced or derived from solid waste received at a resource recovery facility or recovered through a resource recovery program including, but not limited to, refuse-derived fuel, compost materials, methane gas, and other similar products, provided that in lieu of engaging in public advertising for bids and the bidding therefor, the contracting unit shall, prior to commencing the procurement process, submit for approval to the Director of the Division of Local Government Services, a written detailed description of the process to be followed in securing the services.  Within 30 days after receipt of the written description the director shall, if the director finds that the process provides for fair competition and integrity in the negotiation process, approve, in writing, the description submitted by the contracting unit.  If the director finds that the process does not provide for fair competition and integrity in the negotiation process, the director shall advise the contracting unit of the deficiencies that must be remedied.  If the director fails to respond in writing to the contracting unit within 30 days, the procurement process as described shall be deemed approved. As used in this section, "collection" means the physical removal of recyclable materials from curbside or any other location selected by the contracting unit. (6)  Notwithstanding any provision of law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, the contract is for the provision of electricity by a contracting unit engaged in the distribution of electricity for retail sale, for the provision of wholesale electricity by a municipal shared services energy authority as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2015, c.129 (C.40A:66-3), or for the provision of administrative or dispatching services related to the transmission of electricity, provided that in lieu of engaging in public advertising for bids and the bidding therefor, the contracting unit shall, prior to commencing the procurement process, submit for approval to the Director of the Division of Local Government Services, a written detailed description of the process to be followed in securing these services.  The process shall be designed in a way that is appropriate to and commensurate with industry practices, and the integrity of the government contracting process.  Within 30 days after receipt of the written description, the director shall, if the director finds that the process provides for fair competition and integrity in the negotiation process, approve, in writing, the description submitted by the contracting unit.  If the director finds that the process does not provide for fair competition and integrity in the negotiation process, the director shall advise the contracting unit of the deficiencies that must be remedied.  If the director fails to respond in writing to the contracting unit within 30 days, the procurement process, as submitted to the director pursuant to this section, shall be deemed approved. (cf: P.L.2017, c.131, s.174) 10.  (New section)    There is appropriated from the General Fund $2.5 million to the Domestic Violence Victim Notification Fund created by section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Following the expiration of the four-year pilot program established by P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), any unexpended funds shall be returned to the General Fund. 11.  (New section)    Not later than one year following the implementation of the pilot program, and annually thereafter for a total of four years, the Attorney General shall submit to the Governor and to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), a report containing an evaluation of the pilot program. The report shall recommend whether the pilot program should be continued as a Statewide program. 12.  (New section)    The Attorney General, in conjunction with the Administrative Office of the Courts, Division of Probation Services, and the State Parole Board, and in consultation with the Ocean County Prosecutor and Ocean County Sheriff and any other entities that the Attorney General deems necessary, shall promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of  P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 13.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire upon submission of the fourth annual report to the Governor and Legislature pursuant to section 11 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). STATEMENT This bill establishes a four-year pilot program in Ocean County for electronic monitoring of certain domestic violence offenders and notification to victims. The pilot program would be designated as Lisas Law in remembrance of Letizia Zindell of Toms River, a domestic violence victim murdered by her former fiancée. The pilot program would be ordered only with the victims informed consent and would apply to defendants convicted of contempt of a domestic violence order entered pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et al.) or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.). The bill provides that the court may, in making the determination whether to place the defendant on electronic monitoring, hold a hearing to consider the likelihood that the defendant's participation in electronic monitoring would deter the defendant from injuring the victim. The court would consider the following factors: the gravity and seriousness of harm that the defendant inflicted on the victim; the defendants previous history of domestic violence and other criminal acts, if any; whether the defendant has access to a weapon; and whether the defendant has threatened suicide or homicide or has a history of mental illness or substance abuse. This bill requires that any electronic monitoring device and tracking system worn or utilized by a defendant be in compliance with Offender Tracking Systems NIJ Standard 1004.00, issued by the National Institute of Justice in July 2016, and any successor standards adopted by the National Institute of Justice.  The NIJ Standard encompasses protocols for performance, safety, software requirements, and testing of electronic monitoring devices. The National Institute of Justice is the research, development, and evaluation agency of the United States Department of Justice. Under the bill, a defendant ordered by the court to be placed on electronic monitoring may be ordered to pay the costs and expenses related to electronic monitoring and victim notification or a portion of the costs and expenses, based on the defendants ability to pay. In addition, the defendant would be assessed a monitoring fee of $250. The court could waive the fee in cases of extreme financial hardship. The fee would be forwarded to the Domestic Violence Victim Notification Fund established under the bill. This fund, a dedicated, non-lapsing fund within the General Fund, would be administered by the Attorney General. The fund is to be the depository of the costs and expenses imposed on the defendant and any other monies that may be available to the fund through appropriation by the Legislature or any public or private source. All moneys deposited in the fund would be used to defray the costs of the pilot program. The bill provides that when a defendant is convicted of contempt of a domestic violence order the court may, in addition to or in lieu of any other disposition: (1)   sentence the defendant to electronic monitoring with victim notification; or (2)   sentence the defendant to probation or a suspension of sentence and, as a condition of such probation or suspension, order electronic monitoring with victim notification. The bill would also make it a crime of the third degree to tamper with, remove, or vandalize an electronic monitoring device. A crime of the third degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of three to five years or a fine of up to $15,000 or both. The bill requires the victim to be given the following information before providing informed consent: (1) information concerning the victim's right to refuse to participate in electronic monitoring and the process for requesting the court to terminate the victim's participation after it has been ordered; (2) the manner in which the electronic monitoring technology functions and the risks and limitations of that technology, the operational procedures of the device and the applicable instructions regarding the device, and the extent to which the system will track and record the victim's location and movements; (3) the boundaries imposed on the defendant during the electronic monitoring; (4) the sanctions that the court may impose on the defendant for violating a court order; (5) the procedure that the victim is to follow if the defendant violates an order or if the electronic monitoring equipment fails; (6) identification of support services available to assist the victim in developing a safety plan; (7) identification of community services available to assist the victim in obtaining shelter, counseling, child care, legal representation and other assistance; and (8) the non-confidential nature of the victims communications with the court concerning electronic monitoring and the restrictions to be imposed upon the defendants movements. The bill also provides for the following civil penalties which would expire at the end of the fifth year following implementation of the pilot program: (1) any person found by the court in a final domestic violence hearing to have committed an act of domestic violence is to be required to pay a civil penalty of $200, similar to the monitoring fee this penalty may be waived in cases of extreme financial hardship; and (2) in addition to any other disposition, the court would impose a civil penalty of $250 on any person convicted of a crime or offense involving domestic violence, or convicted of contempt of a domestic violence order, unless the person was previously assessed the $250 monitoring fee. The bill further provides that no supplier of a product, system, or service used for electronic monitoring with victim notification in the pilot program would be liable, directly or indirectly, for damages arising from any injury or death associated with the use of the product, system or service unless, and only to the extent that, such action is based on a claim that the injury or death was proximately caused by a manufacturing defect in the product or system. The bill also amends the Local Public Contracts Law, P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.), to provide that services and equipment necessary for the implementation of the pilot program could be negotiated and awarded by a governing body without public advertising for bids and bidding, and be awarded by resolution of the governing body. The bill appropriates $2.5 million from the General Fund to the Domestic Violence Victim Notification Fund, and provides that following the expiration of the four-year pilot program, any unexpended funds are to be returned to the General Fund. The bill provides that not later than one year following the implementation of the pilot program and annually thereafter for four years, the Attorney General is to submit a report to the Governor and Legislature containing an evaluation of the pilot program with a recommendation as to whether it should be continued as a Statewide program. In addition, the bill requires the Attorney General, in consultation with the Administrative Office of the Courts, to develop procedures to determine, investigate, and report on a 24-hour-per-day basis a defendant's noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the electronic monitoring program.  All reports of noncompliance would be investigated by a law enforcement officer within a reasonable period of time.
