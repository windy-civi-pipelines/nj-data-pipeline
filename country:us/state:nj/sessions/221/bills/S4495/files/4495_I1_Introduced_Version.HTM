P.L.1938, c.366 (C.17:48-1 et seq.), or approved for issuance or renewal in
this State by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance on or after the
effective date of this act, shall provide coverage for expenses incurred for
the treatment of lipedema.  The expenses for which coverage shall be provided
shall include compression garments for all of the subscribers affected
extremities, manual lymphatic drainage, medical nutrition therapy, mental
health care, lipectomy that is determined to be medically necessary by the
subscribers surgeon, and pre-and post-lipectomy appointments with the
subscribers physician and surgeon.</p>

expenses incurred for the treatment of lipedema, a hospital service corporation
shall only require a subscriber to provide documentation from the subscribers physician
diagnosing the subscriber with lipedema and, if applicable, documentation from
the subscribers surgeon that includes photographs of the subscriber that
support the diagnosis and information on the number of lipectomies the
subscribers surgeon deems medically necessary.    If a hospital service
corporation denies coverage for expenses incurred for the treatment of lipedema,
the hospital service corporation shall provide the subscriber with a detailed
explanation of the reason for the denial.  A hospital service corporation shall

medically necessary by the subscribers surgeon and shall not require a

necessary to be removed from the subscriber during a lipectomy in order to
receive coverage. </p>

provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, prior authorization
for a lipectomy shall be valid for a period of one year from the date the

authorization within that period if (1) the subscriber continues to be eligible
for coverage; (2) the clinical information provided at the time the prior
authorization request was made has not been misrepresented by the surgeon or subscriber;
and (3) there has not been a material change in the clinical circumstances or
condition of the subscriber.  On receipt of information documenting a prior
authorization from the subscriber or the subscribers surgeon, a hospital

a lipectomy by the subscribers previous carrier for the remainder of the
duration of the prior authorization.</p>

provided include compression garments for all of the covered persons affected
extremities, manual lymphatic drainage, medical nutrition therapy, mental
health care, lipectomy that is determined to be medically necessary by the
covered persons surgeon, and pre-and post-lipectomies appointments with the
covered persons physician and surgeon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a covered
person to provide a carrier with documentation from the covered persons
physician diagnosing the covered person with lipedema and, if applicable,
documentation from the covered persons surgeon that includes photographs of
the covered person that support the diagnosis and information on the number of lipectomies
the covered persons surgeon deems medically necessary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a carrier is
to provide coverage for the total number of lipectomies deemed medically
necessary by the covered persons surgeon and shall not require a covered
persons surgeon to remove less fat than the surgeon deems medically necessary
to be removed from the covered person during lipectomy in order to receive
coverage. If a carrier denies coverage for expenses incurred for the treatment
of lipedema, the carrier is to provide the covered person with a detailed
explanation of the reason for the denial.  A carrier cannot deny coverage for
expenses incurred for the treatment of lipedema solely based on photographs of
the covered person submitted pursuant to the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
provides that prior authorization granted by a carrier for a lipectomy is valid
for a period of one year from the date the covered persons surgeon receives
the prior authorization. A carrier is required to honor a prior authorization
granted to a covered person for a lipectomy by the covered persons previous
carrier for the remainder of the duration of the prior authorization.  Coverage
is to be provided consistent with the current standard of care for lipedema.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lipedema is a chronic,
progressive condition characterized by abnormal and often painful fat
accumulation in specific areas of the body.  The condition does not have a
cure, but lipectomy can help remove fat and reduce the pain associated with the
condition. </p>
