(cf: P.L.2007, c.232, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT At present, the sale, manufacture, use, or possession of a false public utility employee identification badge constitutes criminal conduct.  In order to increase public confidence in authorized public utility workers, and enhance security, public utility workers are required by law to prominently wear a public utility-issued identification badge at service calls.  Since this fact may not be commonly known to public utility customers, an actor who verbally misrepresents his status as a public utility employee, but does not use a badge to gain access to a residence, may still deceive public utility customers and expose them to danger. This bill provides that a person who, for the purpose of gaining access to a residence, purports to be a public utility employee and is admitted to a residence based on the claimed status, but (1) does not possess any documents or writing as required under the provisions of P.L.1977, c.35 (C.48:3-42 et seq.), and (2) does not have authority to access property furnished to the residence by any public utility, is guilty of a disorderly persons offense. A recent incident in New Jersey involved an actor, not a public utility employee, who simply declared to a homeowner that he was a public utility worker sent to perform an inspection. Based upon that representation, he was admitted to the residence, became aggressive towards the homeowner and demanded access to every room of the premises.
