percent of this amount shall be used to provide funding for Class I renewable
energy projects in the State.  In each of the following fifth through eighth
years, the Statewide funding for such programs shall be no less than 50 percent
of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public
utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of

commitments, the minimum amount of funding for such programs shall increase by
an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the additional funds made
available, until the minimum amount of funding dedicated to such programs
reaches $140,000,000 total.  After the eighth year the board shall make a
determination as to the appropriate level of funding for these programs.  Such
programs shall include a program to provide financial incentives for the
installation of Class I renewable energy projects in the State, and the board,
in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall
determine the level and total amount of such incentives as well as the
renewable technologies eligible for such incentives which shall include, at a

be funded by the societal benefits charge, the level of cost recovery and
performance incentives for old and new programs and whether the recovery of
demand side management programs' costs currently approved by the board may be
reduced or extended over a longer period of time.  The board shall make these
determinations taking into consideration existing market barriers and
environmental benefits, with the objective of transforming markets, capturing
lost opportunities, making energy services more affordable for low income
customers and eliminating subsidies for programs that can be delivered in the
marketplace without electric public utility and gas public utility customer
