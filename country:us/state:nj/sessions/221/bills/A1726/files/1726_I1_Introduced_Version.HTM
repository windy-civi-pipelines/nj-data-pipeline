after the visitation, which may include the sentencing judge or the judge who
coordinates the program for the court, the defendant, defendant's counsel, and,
if available, the defendant's parents to discuss the visitation and its effect
on the defendant's future conduct.  If a personal conference is not practicable
because of the defendant's absence from the jurisdiction, conflicting time
schedules, or any other reason, the court shall require the defendant to submit
a written report concerning the visitation experience and its impact on the
defendant.  The county, a court, any facility visited pursuant to the program,

drug recognition expert is an individual specially trained to make this
determination.  The Drug Recognition Expert program and procedures were
initially developed in the 1970's by the Los Angeles Police Department.  This
procedure trains officers to use a standardized twelve-step evaluation process
that allows the officer to determine whether the suspect is under the influence
of drugs, and to determine the category of drug that is causing the observable
impairment.  The twelve-step procedure also allows the officer to rule in or
out many medical conditions, such as illness or injury, which may be
contributing to the subject's impairment.  There are approximately 400 of these
trained officers in New Jersey, and 50 certified instructors.  </p>

a person who refuses to submit to an evaluation after being arrested for a
violation of R.S.39:4-50 would be subject to the same penalties currently faced
by a person who refuses to submit to a test to determine the content of alcohol
in the person's blood.  Those penalties include revoking the right to operate a
motor vehicle for seven months, in the case of a first offender.  For a second
refusal, the person's license would be revoked for two years and for a third or
subsequent offense, 10 years. </p>
