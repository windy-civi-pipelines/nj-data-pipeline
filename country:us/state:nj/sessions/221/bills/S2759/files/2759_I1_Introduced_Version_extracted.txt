Lymphedema is caused by an abnormality of the lymphatic system leading to excessive build-up of tissue fluid that forms lymph, known as interstitial fluid. Interstitial fluid can build up in any area of the body that has inadequate lymph drainage and cause lymphedema.  Left untreated, lymphedema leads to chronic inflammation, infection and hardening of the skin that, in turn results in further lymph vessel damage and distortion of the shape of affected body parts.  Lymphedema is a condition that develops slowly and once present is usually progressive. Although some people are born with abnormalities in the lymphatic system, a condition known as Primary Lymphedema, most lymphedema in the United States is Secondary Lymphedema.  This type of lymphedema occurs from damage to the lymphatic system, commonly from cancer and its treatment, but also from trauma to the skin such as from burns or infections.  Lymphedema can occur as a result of breast cancer, melanoma, gynecologic cancer, head and neck cancer, and sarcoma. Early diagnosis of lymphedema is important since treatment is most effective when commenced at the earliest stage of the disease.  Lymphedema has no cure, but can be successfully managed when properly diagnosed and treated.  Every patient diagnosed with lymphedema should have access to established effective treatment.
