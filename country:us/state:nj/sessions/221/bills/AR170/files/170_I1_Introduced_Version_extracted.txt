AR170 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 170 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED DECEMBER 12, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  AL BARLAS District 40 (Bergen, Essex and Passaic) Assemblywoman  SHAMA A. HAIDER District 37 (Bergen) Assemblywoman  ELLEN J. PARK District 37 (Bergen) SYNOPSIS Opposes New Yorks congestion pricing plan. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Assembly Resolution opposing New Yorks congestion pricing plan. Whereas, The State of New York has approved several measures designed to generate additional revenue streams to fix various fiscal needs in the state, including a congestion pricing plan to generate revenue to fund the operations of and improvements to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) subway system, rail transit lines, and bus service; and Whereas, The current congestion pricing plan, approved by the Federal Highway Administration in November 2024, would include the establishment of a toll that increases over the next six years and will be charged to motor vehicle drivers that enter Manhattans central business district, which consists of the area of Manhattan south of and inclusive of 60th Street, with certain limited exceptions and credits; and Whereas, The congestion pricing plan is set to begin on January 5, 2025 with most drivers paying $9 to enter Manhattans central business district, with such toll increasing to $12 in 2028 and to $15 in 2031; and Whereas, Like those in New York, the residents of New Jersey and its public officials understand the importance of reducing traffic congestion, adequately funding transportation, and strengthening the economic vitality of the region; and Whereas, In prior years, officials from both states have collaborated in areas of common interest, particularly regarding transportation and infrastructure needs, which ultimately led to the creation of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority), the construction of most of the major trans-Hudson crossings for motor vehicles, and the operation of a trans-Hudson transit system that serves Manhattans central business district; and Whereas, For over a century, the two states have jointly made decisions through the Port Authority with the ultimate goal of doing what is best for the two states and the region, which is what makes it surprising that New York City, in conjunction with the State of New York and the Federal Highway Administration, has been authorized to implement a congestion pricing plan that has the potential to significantly impact New Jersey residents and to undermine the long history of collaborative efforts on transportation, infrastructure, and economic development by the two states; and Whereas, The impact that the congestion pricing plan will have on New Jersey residents, with no benefit to transit services such as the New Jersey Transit Corporation or the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH), combined with the fact that no New Jersey lawmakers and business owners have any input or decision-making power over the plan makes it clear that the State of New Jersey must oppose New Yorks congestion pricing plan; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House opposes New Yorks plan to implement a central business district tolling program, commonly referred to as New Yorks congestion pricing plan. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, the Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation, the Mayor of the City of New York, the Governor of the State of New York, the Governor of the State of New Jersey, and each member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution expresses opposition to New Yorks plan to implement a central business district tolling program, which is commonly referred to as New Yorks congestion pricing plan.  The plan establishes a toll to charge motor vehicle drivers that enter Manhattans central business district, which consists of the area of Manhattan south of and inclusive of 60th Street.  Under the current plan, most drivers will pay a toll of $9 to enter Manhattans central business district starting on January 5, 2025, which toll will then increase to $12 in 2028 and $15 in 2031.  While the residents of New Jersey and its public officials understand the importance of reducing traffic congestion, adequately funding transportation, and strengthening the economic vitality of the region, the fact that no New Jersey lawmakers or business owners have any input or decision-making power over the plan makes it clear that the State of New Jersey must oppose New Yorks congestion pricing plan.
