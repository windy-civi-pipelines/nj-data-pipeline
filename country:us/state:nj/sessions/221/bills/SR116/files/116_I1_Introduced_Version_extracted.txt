SR116 SENATE RESOLUTION No. 116 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED OCTOBER 28, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  VIN GOPAL District 11 (Monmouth) SYNOPSIS Requests that federal government offer legal remedies to victims exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and incentivize research into effects of those substances. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Senate Resolution requesting that the federal government offer legal remedies to victims exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and incentivize research into the effects of exposure to those substances. Whereas, Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemical compounds that persist and bioaccumulate in the environment; and Whereas, PFAS have been identified in countless consumer products, including clothing, wall paint, personal care products, cookware, and insulation; and Whereas, Peer-reviewed studies have detected PFAS in the drinking water of at least 200 million individuals in the United States; and Whereas, PFAS exposure, even at low levels, has been linked to several diseases, including cancer, reproductive and developmental damage, and harms to the immune system; and Whereas, The State of New Jersey has made efforts to address and mitigate the harmful effects that the chemicals present to citizens through law; and Whereas, Currently, no federal statutory cause of action exists for individuals damaged by the long-term effects of PFAS; and Whereas, The proposed federal PFAS Accountability Act of 2024, S.3725, introduced in the United States Senate, would ensure there are legal remedies for those exposed to PFAS by PFAS manufacturers and would incentivize funding for PFAS research; and Whereas, By expressing support of this bill, New Jersey could catalyze Congressional action to indemnify PFAS harms; and Whereas, In this context, it is fitting, proper, and in the public interest of this State to request that the federal government protect victims of exposure to PFAS and incentivize research into the impacts of those substances; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The Senate of the State of New Jersey requests that the United States Congress pass legislation to offer legal remedies for victims of PFAS exposure against manufacturers and to incentivize research into the effects of exposure to those substances. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the Speaker and Minority leader of the House of Representatives, the Majority and Minority leaders of the United States Senate, and every member of Congress from this State. STATEMENT This resolution respectfully requests that the United States Congress pass legislation to support and incentivize research into the effects of exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and offer legal remedies for victims of PFAS exposure against manufacturers. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemical compounds that persist and bioaccumulate in the environment.  PFAS have been identified in countless consumer products, including clothing, wall paint, personal care products, cookware, and insulation.  The chemicals have also been traced to drinking water supplies.  Residues are absorbed through human skin and tear ducts, and often ingested.  These forever chemicals then persist in the body and environment without breaking down. Research has associated PFAS exposure with multiple types of cancer, liver damage, reproductive issues, suppressed vaccine response, childhood developmental delays, and other health challenges. Nearly all individuals carry some trace of PFAS in their bodies.  Some occupations experience long-term exposure that makes employees especially vulnerable to the associated health risks.  Police officers, transit workers, firefighters, and manual laborers often work with materials containing the chemicals. The workplace is not the only site of potential PFAS exposure.  Over twenty drinking water systems across New Jersey exceeded State PFAS limits in 2022, placing a wider network of New Jersey residents and workers at risk of health effects. In February 2024, the PFAS Accountability Act of 2024 was introduced in the United States Senate.  Under this bill, PFAS damages would be classified as a lawful injury and the bill would shift the costs of medical monitoring from those individuals to the parties responsible for exposure.  The bill would also express Congress's desire to incentivize funding for PFAS safety research.  By expressing support of this bill, New Jersey could catalyze congressional action to address PFAS harms. The fragmented state-level response to PFAS exposure warrants and necessitates a unified federal cause of action to address the concerns that the chemical presents.  In this light, it is necessary that New Jersey requests that the federal government offer legal avenues to protect victims of PFAS manufacturing and incentivize research into the prevention of harm from those substances, through the PFAS Accountability Act of 2024 or corresponding legislation.
