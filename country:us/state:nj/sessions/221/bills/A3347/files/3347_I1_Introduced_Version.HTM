(cf: P.L.2019, c.225, s.2) 2.    (New section)  The Commissioner of Community Affairs shall develop the content and materials for the basic courses module on warehouse development and high-density development, required pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2005, c.133 (C.40:55D-23.3), within 120 days of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the Commissioner of Community Affairs to prepare and offer a module on warehouse development and high-density development as a part of the commissioners basic course in land use law and planning.  The basic course is offered to current and prospective members, and alternate members, of: local planning boards; zoning boards of adjustment; supplemental zoning boards of adjustment; and combined boards. Innovation within the warehousing sector of the economy has led to the development of very large warehousing facilities on sites that were zoned for smaller, traditional types of warehouses.  While these types of developments are of Statewide economic importance, the unanticipated development of large-scale regional warehousing facilities has, at times, resulted in significant negative regional impacts.  In order to better inform municipal governments and local planning officials of this problem and possible solutions, the State Planning Commission prepared a warehouse guidance document in September 2022.  By including a module on warehouse development and high-density development as a part of the basic course in land use law and planning, local officials will be better prepared to consider and address these important issues.
