An Act concerning motor vehicle surcharges and amending P.L.2009, c.224. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.2009, c.224 (C.39:2A-42) is amended to read as follows: 2. a. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, no later than six months [from the date of enactment of this act] following the effective date of P.L.    , c.      (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and [periodically] every three years thereafter, the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission shall establish promotional payment incentives and shall offer such incentives to any driver who has failed to pay any motor vehicle surcharges levied pursuant to paragraph (1) or paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.1983, c.65 (C.17:29A-35) or who has been authorized by the chief administrator to pay a surcharge levied pursuant to paragraph (1) or paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.1983, c.65 (C.17:29A-35) on an installment basis.  The promotional payment incentives afforded under this subsection shall not apply to surcharges levied pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.1983, c.65 (C.17:29A-35) nor shall any driver who has any outstanding surcharges levied pursuant to that paragraph be eligible to participate in any promotional payment incentives established by the chief administrator. Promotional payment incentives may include, but need not be limited to, waivers of down payments necessary to satisfy any surcharge suspension, waivers of interest for the payment of the full principal amount of any surcharges owed to the chief administrator, or any other incentive that the chief administrator establishes. b.    All monies collected pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be remitted to the "Motor Vehicle Surcharges Revenue Fund," established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.2004, c.70 (C.34:1B-21.28).

STATEMENT This bill requires the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission to offer promotional payment incentives every three years to drivers who have failed to pay motor vehicle surcharges levied for accumulated motor vehicle penalty points and for violations or convictions for which penalty points are not assessed.  Under current law, the chief administrator is required to offer these incentives periodically.  This bill requires the incentives to be offered every three years. Under current law, these promotional payment incentives may include waivers of down payments necessary to satisfy any surcharge suspension, waivers of interest for the payment of the full principal amount of any surcharges owed to the chief administrator, or any other incentive that the chief administrator establishes.   The bill preserves provisions of current law that prohibit promotional payment incentives for surcharges levied against drivers convicted of intoxicated driving or failing to consent to a chemical test to determine their blood alcohol content.
