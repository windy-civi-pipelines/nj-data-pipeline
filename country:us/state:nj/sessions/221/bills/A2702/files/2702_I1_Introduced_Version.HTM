(3)   Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to prevent the incumbent of any office from abstaining from voting in any matter in which the incumbent believes he or she has a conflict of duty or of interest, nor to prevent a challenge of a right to vote on that account under the principles of the common law or any statute. (4)   a.  (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.161). b.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.161). c.     For the purposes of this section the term "elective office" shall mean an office to which an incumbent is elected by the vote of the general electorate.

STATEMENT Under current law, a person elected to public office in this State is prohibited from holding simultaneously any other elective public office.  Persons who simultaneously held more than one elective public office on February 1, 2008 were permitted to continue to hold the elective public offices simultaneously if service in those elective public offices was continuous following that effective date. This bill removes that exception.  Persons who were allowed to hold multiple elective public offices will be permitted to hold those offices only until the expiration date of the term of office that occurs next following the bills effective date.  From then on, the person may hold only one elective public office. This bill also expands this prohibition against dual office holding by also prohibiting a person elected to any public office in this State from simultaneously holding a salaried appointive public office or position in State, county, or municipal government, or on any authority thereof. The bill is prospective in its application, so that a person who holds simultaneously an elective public office and a salaried appointive public office on the effective date of the bill may continue to hold the elective and appointive public offices simultaneously until the expiration date of the term of the elective office that occurs next following the bills effective date.  From then on, the person may hold only one office.
