The names of persons eligible for jury service shall be selected from a single juror source list of county residents whose names and addresses shall be obtained from a merger of the following lists:  registered voters, licensed drivers, filers of State gross income tax returns and filers of homestead or similar rebate or credit application forms and persons filing, applying for, or receiving unemployment benefits or other assistance pursuant to a State program administered by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development or the Department of Community Affairs.  The county election board, the [Division of] Motor [Vehicles] Vehicle Commission, [and] the State Division of Taxation, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and the Department of Community Affairs shall provide [these lists annually] lists comprised of the most current available records by May 1 of each year to the [Assignment Judge of the county] Administrative Director of the Courts.  The Assignment Judge may provide for the merger of additional lists of persons eligible for jury service that may contribute to the breadth of the juror source list.   Merger of the lists of eligible jurors into a single juror source list shall include a reasonable attempt to eliminate duplication of names and a reasonable attempt to select the mailing address from the most frequently updated source list. b.    The juror source list shall be compiled once a year or more often as directed by the Assignment Judge. c.     The juror source list may be expanded by the Supreme Court as it deems appropriate.

STATEMENT This bill expands the list of persons that may serve as jurors by providing juror eligibility to persons with criminal convictions and by including in the jury source list records of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DOLWD) and Department of Community Affairs (DCA). This bill eliminates the permanent disqualification of persons convicted of certain crimes to serve as jurors.  Under current law, persons with criminal convictions for indictable offenses are permanently disqualified from serving as jurors.  Under the bill, they would be permitted to serve as jurors when they are no longer in custody or under supervision in the form of probation or parole. The bill also includes in the juror source list records of DOLWD and DCA.  The DOLWD records include persons who apply for unemployment and other public benefits.  The juror source list currently includes registered voters, licensed drivers, and persons who file State gross income tax returns or apply for homestead rebates and credit applications. This bill incorporates certain recommendations in the April 2022 report of the Judicial Conference on Jury Selection to improve jury selection processes.
