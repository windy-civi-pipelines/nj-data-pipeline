<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 3 of P.L.1945,
c.169 (C.10:5-3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    The Legislature finds
and declares that practices of discrimination against any of its inhabitants,
because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, gender
identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, marital status,
familial status, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United
States, disability <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>or<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b><u>,</u>
nationality, <u>or height or weight,</u> are matters of concern to the
government of the State, and that such discrimination threatens not only the
rights and proper privileges of the inhabitants of the State but menaces the
institutions and foundation of a free democratic State; provided, however, that
nothing in this expression of policy prevents the making of legitimate
distinctions between citizens and aliens when required by federal law or
otherwise necessary to promote the national interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further
declares its opposition to such practices of discrimination when directed
against any person by reason of the race, creed, color, national origin,
ancestry, age, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual
orientation, marital status, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the
United States, disability <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>or<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b><u>,</u>
nationality<u>, or height or weight</u> of that person or that person's family
members, partners, members, stockholders, directors, officers, managers,
superintendents, agents, employees, business associates, suppliers, or
customers, in order that the economic prosperity and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the State may be protected and ensured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
that because of discrimination, people suffer personal hardships, and the State
suffers a grievous harm.  The personal hardships include: economic loss; time
loss; physical and emotional stress; and in some cases severe emotional trauma,
illness, homelessness or other irreparable harm resulting from the strain of
employment controversies; relocation, search and moving difficulties; anxiety
caused by lack of information, uncertainty, and resultant planning difficulty;
career, education, family and social disruption; and adjustment problems, which
particularly impact on those protected by this act.  Such harms have, under the
common law, given rise to legal remedies, including compensatory and punitive
damages.  The Legislature intends that such damages be available to all persons
protected by this act and that this act shall be liberally construed in
combination with other protections available under the laws of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2019, c.436, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    All persons shall have
the opportunity to obtain employment, and to obtain all the accommodations,
advantages, facilities, and privileges of any place of public accommodation,
publicly assisted housing accommodation, and other real property without
discrimination because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age,
marital status, affectional or sexual orientation, familial status, disability,
liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, nationality,
sex, gender identity or expression <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>or<b><span

source of lawful income used for rental or mortgage payments, <u>or height or
weight</u> subject only to conditions and limitations applicable alike to all
persons.  This opportunity is recognized as and declared to be a civil right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Section 6 of P.L.1945,
c.169 (C.10:5-6) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    There is created in the
Department of Law and Public Safety a division known as &quot;The Division on
Civil Rights&quot; with power to prevent and eliminate discrimination in the

States, <u>or height or weight</u> by employers, labor organizations,
employment agencies or other persons and to take other actions against
discrimination because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry,
marital status, sex, familial status, nationality, disability, <b><span

Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall

shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of

a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a
waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree,
not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be

any authorized representative of the other employee or former employee.</p>

an employer of an employee who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make
available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as
bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance
with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary
transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the
pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of her physician, requests the

employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue
hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in
any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or privileges of employment
for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided
pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee
affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less
favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected
by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to
work.  This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or

connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship
on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered
include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number
of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of
the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the
employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking
into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside
funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an
essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business
necessity requirement.</p>

responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation
of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in
order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of
compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made
pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   That the differential is
based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the

factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation
based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class;</p>

is applied reasonably;</p>

factors account for the entire wage differential; and</p>
