STATEMENT This bill requires health benefit plans to cover the cost of a mammogram if a health care provider recommends the examination. Presently, health benefit plans are only required to cover mammograms for women who are 40 and over or women under the age of 40 if they have a family history of breast cancer or other breast cancer related risk factor.  Health benefit plans must also cover additional testing of an entire breast or breasts after a baseline mammogram examination.  Under this bill, health benefit plans will be required to cover the cost of a mammogram examination, and any additional testing after the examination, if the health care provider of the subscriber or other person covered under the plan recommends it.  Mammograms for women 40 and over will still be covered under this bill. This bill, named Michelles Law, is in response to the tragic death of Michelle DeVita.  Michelle was a 38-year-old woman who lost her battle to breast cancer.  Under the requirements of the current law, insurance was not required to provide her coverage for a mammogram.

STATEMENT This bill requires health benefit plans to cover the cost of a mammogram if a health care provider recommends the examination. Presently, health benefit plans are only required to cover mammograms for women who are 40 and over or women under the age of 40 if they have a family history of breast cancer or other breast cancer related risk factor.  Health benefit plans must also cover additional testing of an entire breast or breasts after a baseline mammogram examination.  Under this bill, health benefit plans will be required to cover the cost of a mammogram examination, and any additional testing after the examination, if the health care provider of the subscriber or other person covered under the plan recommends it.  Mammograms for women 40 and over will still be covered under this bill. This bill, named Michelles Law, is in response to the tragic death of Michelle DeVita.  Michelle was a 38-year-old woman who lost her battle to breast cancer.  Under the requirements of the current law, insurance was not required to provide her coverage for a mammogram.
