For the purposes of this section, the [Commissioner of Education] commissioner shall establish a uniform methodology for the reporting of the data concerning administrative personnel on a full-time equivalent basis. (cf: P.L.2021, c.387, s.1) 7.    Section 10 of P.L.2011, c.176 (C.18A:36C-10) is amended to read as follows: 10.  a.  The renaissance school project shall be authorized for 10 years from the date of opening, subject to periodic reviews by the commissioner.  The renaissance school project shall be automatically renewed for additional five-year periods provided there is not a breach of the agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the renaissance school project. Every [ten] 10 years, the commissioner shall conduct a comprehensive review of the renaissance school project prior to granting a renewal.  Renewal at these 10-year intervals shall be presumed  provided there is not a breach of the agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the renaissance school project and the renaissance school project's average percent of students proficient on the New Jersey [Assessment of Skills and Knowledge] Student Learning Assessments, if the school includes any grades from three to eight, [or on the New Jersey High School Proficiency Assessment, if the school includes grades 11 and 12,] exceed the average percent of students proficient for the renaissance school district in which it is located in like grades by 15 percent or more in language arts literacy, mathematics, or both after five years, and 25 percent or more in language arts literacy, mathematics, or both after [ten] 10 years, or achieves the State-level proficiency standards during that period. b.    The commissioner shall periodically assess whether each renaissance school project is meeting its goals and improving student achievement.  In order to facilitate the commissioner's review, each renaissance school project shall submit an annual report to the commissioner in the form prescribed by the commissioner.  The report shall be received annually by August 1 and shall be made publicly available immediately thereafter, including on the Department of Education's website. c.     The commissioner shall have on-going access to the records and facilities of the renaissance school project and the nonprofit entity to ensure that the renaissance school project is in compliance with its organizational document and with State laws and regulations. d.    Five years following the date of the opening of the  third renaissance school project, or [ten] 10 years after the opening of the first renaissance school project, whichever occurs first, a review of the efficacy of the program shall be conducted by an independent education researcher or research organization selected by the commissioner.  The independent review shall be funded by the Department of Education.  The review shall include interviews with staff, parents, and resident district representatives, and a fiscal and educational assessment. The commissioner shall report the results of the review to the Governor, the State Board of Education, and to the Legislature as provided pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), and, in addition, the Governor shall report on the efficacy of the renaissance school projects in educating students and whether additional renaissance school districts should be authorized and, if so, how many.  The commissioner shall also recommend any changes to this act deemed appropriate based on experience with the renaissance school projects and the independent review. (cf: P.L.2011, c.176, s.10) 8.    The following are repealed: Section 6 of P.L.1979, c.241 (C.18A:7C-6); Section 5 of P.L.1988, c.168 (C.18A:7C-6.1); Section 7 of P.L.1988, c.168 (C.18A:7C-10); and Section 8 of P.L.1988, c.168 (C.18A:7C-11). 9.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill eliminates the high school graduation proficiency test, which is required under current law to be taken in the 11th grade. It is the belief of the sponsor that graduation exit testing does not accurately represent student learning or career and college readiness. Studies have shown numerous flaws with standardized testing, including variation in student performance based on external circumstances, strong racial and socioeconomic biases, and inconsistency with material taught in class. The purpose of using standardized tests as graduation requirements is often to assess college readiness, however studies have shown that other metrics, such as grade point average, can predict the likelihood of graduation from college up to five times better than standardized test scores. In recent years, many states have eliminated graduation exit testing for these reasons, and currently only 11 states still maintain a testing requirement for high school graduation. The bill prohibits the State Board of Education from including in the standards for graduation from high school a requirement that students achieve satisfactory performance on the Statewide graduation proficiency test. The bill also amends current law to remove various references to the graduation proficiency test, including: the requirement that a Statewide proficiency test be included in the State or district standards for graduation from high school; the requirement that an out-of-school youth or adult age 18 or older pass the graduation proficiency test before being granted a State endorsed diploma; the requirement that school district report cards include information regarding the results of the graduation proficiency test; and the requirement that renaissance school projects be evaluated based on students performance on the graduation proficiency test. The bill clarifies that a student participating in the State Seal of Biliteracy program would not be required to take a State graduation proficiency test as a condition of graduation from high school. Finally, the bill repeals the section of law that requires the State to administer a graduation proficiency test to all 11th grade students and certain 12th grade students, and repeals the section of law that requires the Commissioner of Education to consult with educators, parents, students, business and community representatives, and members of minority groups while developing the graduation proficiency test. The bill also repeals sections of law requiring the commissioner and the Joint Committee on the Public Schools to review and report on performance on the graduation proficiency test.
