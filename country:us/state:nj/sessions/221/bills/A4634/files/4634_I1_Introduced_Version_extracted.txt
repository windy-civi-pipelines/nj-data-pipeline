A4634 ASSEMBLY, No. 4634 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 25, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  MICHAEL INGANAMORT District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywomen Matsikoudis and Fantasia SYNOPSIS Requires Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery-Armed Forces Qualifying Test to be offered as alternative assessment for high school graduation proficiency test requirement. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning public high school graduation requirements and supplementing P.L.1979, c.241 (C.18A:7C-1 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The State Board of Education shall recognize the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery-Armed Forces Qualifying Test (ASVAB-AFQT) as an alternative assessment for the high school graduation proficiency test requirement. 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery- Armed Forces Qualifying Test to be offered as alternative assessment for the high school graduation proficiency test requirement. Current law requires public high school students to pass the State graduation proficiency test to demonstrate mastery of the State graduation proficiency standards.  State Board of Education regulations establish graduation pathways, which provide that a student may demonstrate proficiency by: 1) achieving a passing score on the State graduation proficiency test; 2) achieving a passing score on a corresponding substitute competency test; or 3) demonstrating proficiency through the portfolio appeals process. The regulations define substitute competency test to mean, for students in the classes of 2018 through 2022, an alternative set of third-party assessments approved by the Commissioner, including, but not limited to, the SAT, PSAT, ACT, ACT-Aspire, Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery-Armed Forces Qualifying Test, or Accuplacer, that can be used to demonstrate competency in the New Jersey Student Learning Standards for students who have not demonstrated proficiency on the State graduation proficiency test. In May 2023, the State Board of Education approved the graduation test requirements for the 2024 and 2025 classes, as well as the list of substitute competency tests, but removed the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery-Armed Forces Qualifying Test.  It is the intent of this bill to reinstate the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery-Armed Forces Qualifying Test as an alternative assessment by adding it back to the list of substitute competency tests.
