MUNOZ District 21 (Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union) SYNOPSIS Authorizes visiting advanced practice nurses who are not certified by endorsement in New Jersey to engage in the limited practice of prescribing medications and devices, if they have appropriate educational qualifications. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the issuance of prescriptions by visiting advanced practice nurses, and amending various sections of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 1 of P.L.1947, c.262 (C.45:11-23) is amended to read as follows: 1.    As used in this [act] chapter: a.     The words "the board" mean the New Jersey Board of Nursing created by this [act] chapter. b.    The practice of nursing as a registered professional nurse is defined as diagnosing and treating human responses to actual or potential physical and emotional health problems, through such services as casefinding, health teaching, health counseling, and provision of care supportive to or restorative of life and well-being, and executing medical regimens as prescribed by a licensed or otherwise legally authorized physician or dentist. Diagnosing in the context of nursing practice means the identification of and discrimination between physical and psychosocial signs and symptoms essential to effective execution and management of the nursing regimen within the scope of practice of the registered professional nurse.  Such diagnostic privilege is distinct from a medical diagnosis.  Treating means selection and performance of those therapeutic measures essential to the effective management and execution of the nursing regimen.  Human responses means those signs, symptoms, and processes which denote the individual's health need or reaction to an actual or potential health problem. The practice of nursing as a licensed practical nurse is defined as performing tasks and responsibilities within the framework of casefinding; reinforcing the patient and family teaching program through health teaching, health counseling and provision of supportive and restorative care, under the direction of a registered nurse or licensed or otherwise legally authorized physician or dentist. The terms "nursing," "professional nursing," and "practical nursing" as used in this [act] chapter shall not be construed to include nursing by students enrolled in a school of nursing accredited or approved by the board performed in the prescribed course of study and training, nor nursing performed in hospitals, institutions and agencies approved by the board for this purpose by graduates of such schools pending the results of the first licensing examination scheduled by the board following completion of a course of study and training and the attaining of age qualification for examination, or thereafter with the approval of the board in the case of each individual pending results of subsequent examinations; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include nursing performed for a period not exceeding 12 months unless the board shall approve a longer period, in hospitals, institutions or agencies by a nurse legally qualified under the laws of another state or country, pending results of an application for licensing under this [act] chapter, if such nurse does not represent or hold himself or herself out as a nurse licensed to practice under this [act] chapter; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include the practice of nursing in this State by any legally qualified nurse of another state whose engagement made outside of this State requires such nurse to accompany and care for the patient while in this State during the period of such engagement, not to exceed six months in this State, if such nurse does not represent or hold himself or herself out as a nurse licensed to practice in this State; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include nursing performed by employees or officers of the United States Government or any agency or service thereof while in the discharge of his or her official duties; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include services performed by nurses aides, attendants, orderlies and ward helpers in hospitals, institutions and agencies or by technicians, physiotherapists, or medical secretaries, and such duties performed by said persons aforementioned shall not be subject to rules or regulations which the board may prescribe concerning nursing; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include first aid nursing assistance, or gratuitous care by friends or members of the family of a sick or infirm person, or incidental care of the sick by a person employed primarily as a domestic or housekeeper, notwithstanding that the occasion for such employment may be sickness, if such incidental care does not constitute professional nursing and such person does not claim or purport to be a licensed nurse; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include services rendered in accordance with the practice of the religious tenets of any well-recognized church or denomination which subscribes to the art of healing by prayer.  A person who is otherwise qualified shall not be denied licensure as a professional nurse or practical nurse by reason of the circumstances that such person is in religious life and has taken a vow of poverty. c.     "Homemaker-home health aide" means a person who is employed by a home care services agency and who is performing delegated nursing regimens or nursing tasks delegated through the authority of a duly licensed registered professional nurse.  No homemaker-home health aide shall follow a delegated nursing regimen or perform tasks which are delegated unless the homemaker-home health aide is under the supervision of a duly licensed registered professional nurse provided by the home care services agency that directly employs the homemaker-home health aide. "Home care services agency" means home health agencies, assisted living residences, comprehensive personal care homes, assisted living programs or alternate family care sponsor agencies licensed by the Department of Health pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et al.), nonprofit homemaker-home health aide agencies, and health care service firms regulated by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety and the Attorney General pursuant to P.L.1989, c.331 (C.34:8-43 et seq.) and P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.) respectively, which are engaged in the business of procuring or offering to procure employment for homemaker-home health aides, where a fee may be exacted, charged or received directly or indirectly for procuring or offering to procure that employment. d.    "Advanced practice nurse" means a person who holds a certification in accordance with section 8 or 9 of P.L.1991, c.377 (C.45:11-47 or 45:11-48). e.     "Collaborating physician" means a person licensed to practice medicine and surgery pursuant to chapter 9 of Title 45 of the Revised Statutes who agrees to work with an advanced practice nurse. f.     Visiting advanced practice nurse means a person who is not a resident of New Jersey, but who is temporarily present in the State; who is licensed or certified as an advanced practice nurse, or the substantial equivalent, by another state or jurisdiction other than New Jersey; and who is not seeking full certification by endorsement, pursuant to N.J.A.C.13:37-7.6, but who wishes to engage in the limited practice of prescribing medications and devices in this State. Visiting advanced practice nurse does not include a non-resident who has already been certified as an advanced practice nurse in this State through the certification by endorsement process specified in N.J.A.C.13:37-7.6. Nothing in this [act] chapter shall confer the authority to a person licensed to practice nursing to practice another health profession as currently defined in Title 45 of the Revised Statutes.

(cf: P.L.1999, c.85, s.8) 7.    Section 13 of P.L.1991, c.377 (C.45:11-52) is amended to read as follows: 13.  The Commissioner of Health [and Senior Services] shall, by rule adopted in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), establish the periods of time within which the charts and records of the patients treated by [the] an advanced practice nurse or a visiting advanced practice nurse in an inpatient setting shall be reviewed by the advanced practice nurse or visiting advanced practice nurse, as the case may be, and the collaborating physician, as required by paragraph (5) of subsection b. of section 10 of P.L.1991, c.377 (C.45:11-49). (cf: P.L.1999, c.85, s.9) 8.    Except as otherwise provided by sections 5 and 7 of this act, the Board of Nursing shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 9.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would authorize certain visiting advanced practice nurses to engage in the limited practice of prescribing medications and devices to patients in this State, so long as the visiting nurses are deemed to be appropriately qualified to engage in prescribing activities. Under the bills provisions, a visiting advanced practice nurse is defined to mean a person who is not a resident of New Jersey, but who is temporarily present in the State; who is licensed or certified as an advanced practice nurse, or the substantial equivalent, by another state or jurisdiction other than New Jersey; and who is not seeking full certification by endorsement, pursuant to N.J.A.C.13:37-7.6, but who wishes to engage only in the limited practice of prescribing medications and devices in this State.  Visiting advanced practice nurse would not include a non-resident who has already been certified as an advanced practice nurse in this State through the certification by endorsement process specified in N.J.A.C.13:37-7.6. In order to ensure that a visiting advanced practice nurse has the appropriate qualifications to engage in the limited practice of prescribing drugs and devices, the bill would require each visiting advanced practice nurse to provide written notice to the Board of Nursing at least 10 days before engaging in the prescription of drugs or devices in this State.  Such written notice would need to indicate the educational qualifications of the visiting advanced practice nurse, the licenses or certifications that are held by the visiting advanced practice nurse, the states or other jurisdictions in which those licenses or certifications were issued, the training requirements that were satisfied for the purposes of obtaining those licenses or certifications, the proposed timeframe during which the visiting advanced practice nurse will be prescribing medications and devices in this State, and any other information that may be required by board regulation. Within seven days after receipt of written notice from a visiting advanced practice nurse, the board would be required to evaluate the nurses credentials, as specified in the notice, and determine whether the nurse is appropriately qualified to engage in the prescription of medications and devices.  If the board determines that the visiting advanced practice nurse is so qualified, the board would be required to notify the nurse, in writing, of that determination and issue a visiting nurse identification number, which is to be printed on all of the prescriptions that are issued by the nurse in the State.  If the board has reason to believe that the visiting advanced practice nurse is not properly authorized by the out-of-State license or certification to engage in the prescription of drugs or devices, or that the training required for the nurses out-of-State license or certification was not substantially equivalent to the training that is required for the certification of advanced practice nurses in this State, the board would be required to issue an order restricting the prescribing practices of the visiting advanced practice nurse. As deemed by the board to be appropriate, an order issued pursuant to the bills provisions may:  1) fully prohibit the visiting advanced practice nurse from prescribing medications or devices in this State, despite the provisions of the bill to the contrary; 2) require the visiting advanced practice nurse, before engaging in the prescription of medications or devices in this State, to submit to a skills assessment and, if necessary, to successfully complete educational training; or 3) provide for the conditional supervision, monitoring, or other limitation of the visiting advanced practice nurses prescribing practices in this State. A visiting advanced practice nurse who is subject to an order of the board may submit to the board, within 20 days after receipt of the order, a written request for a hearing on the matter, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). A visiting advanced practice nurse who prescribes medications or devices in this State without first providing notice to the board, as required by the bill, or who prescribes medications or devices in violation of the provisions of an order issued by the board, would be deemed to be engaged in the unauthorized practice of nursing in this State, and would be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for the first violation, and not more than $20,000 for the second or subsequent violation, as provided by existing law.

MUNOZ District 21 (Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union) SYNOPSIS Authorizes visiting advanced practice nurses who are not certified by endorsement in New Jersey to engage in the limited practice of prescribing medications and devices, if they have appropriate educational qualifications. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the issuance of prescriptions by visiting advanced practice nurses, and amending various sections of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 1 of P.L.1947, c.262 (C.45:11-23) is amended to read as follows: 1.    As used in this [act] chapter: a.     The words "the board" mean the New Jersey Board of Nursing created by this [act] chapter. b.    The practice of nursing as a registered professional nurse is defined as diagnosing and treating human responses to actual or potential physical and emotional health problems, through such services as casefinding, health teaching, health counseling, and provision of care supportive to or restorative of life and well-being, and executing medical regimens as prescribed by a licensed or otherwise legally authorized physician or dentist. Diagnosing in the context of nursing practice means the identification of and discrimination between physical and psychosocial signs and symptoms essential to effective execution and management of the nursing regimen within the scope of practice of the registered professional nurse.  Such diagnostic privilege is distinct from a medical diagnosis.  Treating means selection and performance of those therapeutic measures essential to the effective management and execution of the nursing regimen.  Human responses means those signs, symptoms, and processes which denote the individual's health need or reaction to an actual or potential health problem. The practice of nursing as a licensed practical nurse is defined as performing tasks and responsibilities within the framework of casefinding; reinforcing the patient and family teaching program through health teaching, health counseling and provision of supportive and restorative care, under the direction of a registered nurse or licensed or otherwise legally authorized physician or dentist. The terms "nursing," "professional nursing," and "practical nursing" as used in this [act] chapter shall not be construed to include nursing by students enrolled in a school of nursing accredited or approved by the board performed in the prescribed course of study and training, nor nursing performed in hospitals, institutions and agencies approved by the board for this purpose by graduates of such schools pending the results of the first licensing examination scheduled by the board following completion of a course of study and training and the attaining of age qualification for examination, or thereafter with the approval of the board in the case of each individual pending results of subsequent examinations; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include nursing performed for a period not exceeding 12 months unless the board shall approve a longer period, in hospitals, institutions or agencies by a nurse legally qualified under the laws of another state or country, pending results of an application for licensing under this [act] chapter, if such nurse does not represent or hold himself or herself out as a nurse licensed to practice under this [act] chapter; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include the practice of nursing in this State by any legally qualified nurse of another state whose engagement made outside of this State requires such nurse to accompany and care for the patient while in this State during the period of such engagement, not to exceed six months in this State, if such nurse does not represent or hold himself or herself out as a nurse licensed to practice in this State; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include nursing performed by employees or officers of the United States Government or any agency or service thereof while in the discharge of his or her official duties; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include services performed by nurses aides, attendants, orderlies and ward helpers in hospitals, institutions and agencies or by technicians, physiotherapists, or medical secretaries, and such duties performed by said persons aforementioned shall not be subject to rules or regulations which the board may prescribe concerning nursing; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include first aid nursing assistance, or gratuitous care by friends or members of the family of a sick or infirm person, or incidental care of the sick by a person employed primarily as a domestic or housekeeper, notwithstanding that the occasion for such employment may be sickness, if such incidental care does not constitute professional nursing and such person does not claim or purport to be a licensed nurse; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include services rendered in accordance with the practice of the religious tenets of any well-recognized church or denomination which subscribes to the art of healing by prayer.  A person who is otherwise qualified shall not be denied licensure as a professional nurse or practical nurse by reason of the circumstances that such person is in religious life and has taken a vow of poverty. c.     "Homemaker-home health aide" means a person who is employed by a home care services agency and who is performing delegated nursing regimens or nursing tasks delegated through the authority of a duly licensed registered professional nurse.  No homemaker-home health aide shall follow a delegated nursing regimen or perform tasks which are delegated unless the homemaker-home health aide is under the supervision of a duly licensed registered professional nurse provided by the home care services agency that directly employs the homemaker-home health aide. "Home care services agency" means home health agencies, assisted living residences, comprehensive personal care homes, assisted living programs or alternate family care sponsor agencies licensed by the Department of Health pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et al.), nonprofit homemaker-home health aide agencies, and health care service firms regulated by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety and the Attorney General pursuant to P.L.1989, c.331 (C.34:8-43 et seq.) and P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.) respectively, which are engaged in the business of procuring or offering to procure employment for homemaker-home health aides, where a fee may be exacted, charged or received directly or indirectly for procuring or offering to procure that employment. d.    "Advanced practice nurse" means a person who holds a certification in accordance with section 8 or 9 of P.L.1991, c.377 (C.45:11-47 or 45:11-48). e.     "Collaborating physician" means a person licensed to practice medicine and surgery pursuant to chapter 9 of Title 45 of the Revised Statutes who agrees to work with an advanced practice nurse. f.     Visiting advanced practice nurse means a person who is not a resident of New Jersey, but who is temporarily present in the State; who is licensed or certified as an advanced practice nurse, or the substantial equivalent, by another state or jurisdiction other than New Jersey; and who is not seeking full certification by endorsement, pursuant to N.J.A.C.13:37-7.6, but who wishes to engage in the limited practice of prescribing medications and devices in this State. Visiting advanced practice nurse does not include a non-resident who has already been certified as an advanced practice nurse in this State through the certification by endorsement process specified in N.J.A.C.13:37-7.6. Nothing in this [act] chapter shall confer the authority to a person licensed to practice nursing to practice another health profession as currently defined in Title 45 of the Revised Statutes.

(cf: P.L.1999, c.85, s.9) 8.    Except as otherwise provided by sections 5 and 7 of this act, the Board of Nursing shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 9.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would authorize certain visiting advanced practice nurses to engage in the limited practice of prescribing medications and devices to patients in this State, so long as the visiting nurses are deemed to be appropriately qualified to engage in prescribing activities. Under the bills provisions, a visiting advanced practice nurse is defined to mean a person who is not a resident of New Jersey, but who is temporarily present in the State; who is licensed or certified as an advanced practice nurse, or the substantial equivalent, by another state or jurisdiction other than New Jersey; and who is not seeking full certification by endorsement, pursuant to N.J.A.C.13:37-7.6, but who wishes to engage only in the limited practice of prescribing medications and devices in this State.  Visiting advanced practice nurse would not include a non-resident who has already been certified as an advanced practice nurse in this State through the certification by endorsement process specified in N.J.A.C.13:37-7.6. In order to ensure that a visiting advanced practice nurse has the appropriate qualifications to engage in the limited practice of prescribing drugs and devices, the bill would require each visiting advanced practice nurse to provide written notice to the Board of Nursing at least 10 days before engaging in the prescription of drugs or devices in this State.  Such written notice would need to indicate the educational qualifications of the visiting advanced practice nurse, the licenses or certifications that are held by the visiting advanced practice nurse, the states or other jurisdictions in which those licenses or certifications were issued, the training requirements that were satisfied for the purposes of obtaining those licenses or certifications, the proposed timeframe during which the visiting advanced practice nurse will be prescribing medications and devices in this State, and any other information that may be required by board regulation. Within seven days after receipt of written notice from a visiting advanced practice nurse, the board would be required to evaluate the nurses credentials, as specified in the notice, and determine whether the nurse is appropriately qualified to engage in the prescription of medications and devices.  If the board determines that the visiting advanced practice nurse is so qualified, the board would be required to notify the nurse, in writing, of that determination and issue a visiting nurse identification number, which is to be printed on all of the prescriptions that are issued by the nurse in the State.  If the board has reason to believe that the visiting advanced practice nurse is not properly authorized by the out-of-State license or certification to engage in the prescription of drugs or devices, or that the training required for the nurses out-of-State license or certification was not substantially equivalent to the training that is required for the certification of advanced practice nurses in this State, the board would be required to issue an order restricting the prescribing practices of the visiting advanced practice nurse. As deemed by the board to be appropriate, an order issued pursuant to the bills provisions may:  1) fully prohibit the visiting advanced practice nurse from prescribing medications or devices in this State, despite the provisions of the bill to the contrary; 2) require the visiting advanced practice nurse, before engaging in the prescription of medications or devices in this State, to submit to a skills assessment and, if necessary, to successfully complete educational training; or 3) provide for the conditional supervision, monitoring, or other limitation of the visiting advanced practice nurses prescribing practices in this State. A visiting advanced practice nurse who is subject to an order of the board may submit to the board, within 20 days after receipt of the order, a written request for a hearing on the matter, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). A visiting advanced practice nurse who prescribes medications or devices in this State without first providing notice to the board, as required by the bill, or who prescribes medications or devices in violation of the provisions of an order issued by the board, would be deemed to be engaged in the unauthorized practice of nursing in this State, and would be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $10,000 for the first violation, and not more than $20,000 for the second or subsequent violation, as provided by existing law.
