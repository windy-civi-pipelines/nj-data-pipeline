style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>chapter</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The practice of nursing
as a registered professional nurse is defined as diagnosing and treating human
responses to actual or potential physical and emotional health problems,
through such services as casefinding, health teaching, health counseling, and
provision of care supportive to or restorative of life and well-being, and
executing medical regimens as prescribed by a licensed or otherwise legally
authorized physician or dentist. Diagnosing in the context of nursing practice
means the identification of and discrimination between physical and
psychosocial signs and symptoms essential to effective execution and management
of the nursing regimen within the scope of practice of the registered
professional nurse.  Such diagnostic privilege is distinct from a medical
diagnosis.  Treating means selection and performance of those therapeutic
measures essential to the effective management and execution of the nursing
regimen.  Human responses means those signs, symptoms, and processes which
denote the individual's health need or reaction to an actual or potential
health problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The practice of nursing as a
licensed practical nurse is defined as performing tasks and responsibilities
within the framework of casefinding; reinforcing the patient and family teaching
program through health teaching, health counseling and provision of supportive
and restorative care, under the direction of a registered nurse or licensed or
otherwise legally authorized physician or dentist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The terms &quot;nursing,&quot;

this <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>act<b><span

shall not be construed to include nursing by students enrolled in a school of
nursing accredited or approved by the board performed in the prescribed course
of study and training, nor nursing performed in hospitals, institutions and
agencies approved by the board for this purpose by graduates of such schools
pending the results of the first licensing examination scheduled by the board
following completion of a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>course of study and training and
the attaining of age qualification for examination, or thereafter with the
approval of the board in the case of each individual pending results of
subsequent examinations; nor shall any of said terms be construed to include
nursing performed for a period not exceeding 12 months unless the board shall
approve a longer period, in hospitals, institutions or agencies by a nurse
legally qualified under the laws of another state or country, pending results
of an application for licensing under this <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>act<b><span

this State by any legally qualified nurse of another state whose engagement
made outside of this State requires such nurse to accompany and care for the
patient while in this State during the period of such engagement, not to exceed
six months in this State, if such nurse does not represent or hold himself or
herself out as a nurse licensed to practice in this State; nor shall any of
said terms be construed to include nursing performed by employees or officers
of the United States Government or any agency or service thereof while in the
discharge of his or her official duties; nor shall any of said terms be
construed to include services performed by nurses aides, attendants, orderlies
and ward helpers in hospitals, institutions and agencies or by technicians,
physiotherapists, or medical secretaries, and such duties performed by said
persons aforementioned shall not be subject to rules or regulations which the
board may prescribe concerning nursing; nor shall any of said terms be
construed to include first aid nursing assistance, or gratuitous care by
friends or members of the family of a sick or infirm person, or incidental care
of the sick by a person employed primarily as a domestic or housekeeper,
notwithstanding that the occasion for such employment may be sickness, if such
incidental care does not constitute professional nursing and such person does
not claim or purport to be a licensed nurse; nor shall any of said terms be
construed to include services rendered in accordance with the practice of the
religious tenets of any well-recognized church or denomination which subscribes
to the art of healing by prayer.  A person who is otherwise qualified shall not
be denied licensure as a professional nurse or practical nurse by reason of the
circumstances that such person is in religious life and has taken a vow of
poverty.</p>

through the authority of a duly licensed registered professional nurse.  No
homemaker-home health aide shall follow a delegated nursing regimen or perform
tasks which are delegated unless the homemaker-home health aide is under the
supervision of a duly licensed registered professional nurse provided by the
home care services agency that directly employs the homemaker-home health aide. 
&quot;Home care services agency&quot; means home health agencies, assisted
living residences, comprehensive personal care homes, assisted living programs

visiting advanced practice nurse is so qualified, the board would be required
