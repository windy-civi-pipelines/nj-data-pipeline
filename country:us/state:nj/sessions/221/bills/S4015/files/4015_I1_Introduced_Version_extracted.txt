The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall, at a minimum, require a transitional sober living home, halfway house, or other residential aftercare facility to provide notice to a patient's spouse, parent, legal guardian, designated next of kin, or other designated emergency contact, whenever the patient voluntarily withdraws, or is involuntarily evicted from, such facility, provided that:  (1) such notice is provided in a manner that is consistent with federal requirements under 42 CFR Part 2 and federal HIPAA requirements under 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164; and (2) the patient, if an adult, has not withheld consent for such notice or expressly requested that notification not be given.  If a patient who is not incapacitated withholds consent for such notice, or expressly requests that notification not be given, the department shall require the patient's wishes to be respected unless the patient is a minor child or adolescent, in which case, the department shall require the minor's parent, legal guardian, designated next of kin, or other designated emergency contact to be notified, provided that such notification is not inconsistent with, and would not violate, federal requirements under 42 CFR Part 2 and federal HIPAA requirements under 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164. (cf:  P.L.2017, c.256, s.2) 4.    Section 1 of P.L.1982, c.149 (C.26:2H-11.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    In the case of an application for a certificate of need or initial licensure, as applicable, for a narcotic and drug abuse treatment center to be located within 500 feet from any building in this State used for the instruction of children between the ages of five and 18 years, the applicant shall notify the governing body of the municipality within which the applicant proposes to locate the treatment center of the applicant's intention to apply for the certificate of need or licensure and the proposed location of the center.

(2)   the type of services provided by the facility or center; (3)   the maximum occupancy of the facility or center; and (4)   the number of openings available for persons seeking residency, based on the information received pursuant to subsection e. of this section. c.     The information described in subsection b. of this section shall be: (1)   prominently displayed on the website of the department and searchable by county or the name of the facility or center; (2)   made available to the public, upon request, through the addictions telephone hotline and the Statewide 2-1-1 telephone system; and (3)   made available using any other means that the Commissioner of Human Services deems appropriate. d.    The commissioner is authorized to solicit, receive, and accept grants, funds, or anything of value from any public or private entity, and receive and accept contributions of money, property, labor, or any other thing of value from any legitimate source, for the purpose of the development and maintenance of a registry pursuant to this section. e.     Each facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1975, c.305 (C.26:2B-7 et seq.) and each narcotic and drug abuse treatment center issued a certificate of approval pursuant to P.L.1970, c.334 (C.26:2G-21 et seq.) shall submit to the registry developed and maintained pursuant to this section, no less than once a day, information advising of the number of openings that are available in the facility or center on that day. 17.  The Commissioner of Human Services shall, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt any rules and regulations as the commissioner deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this act. 18.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month next following the date of enactment, except the Commissioner of Human Services may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill would amend the States substance use disorder treatment laws in relation to the regulation of sober living homes and halfway houses.  In particular, the bill would expressly clarify that the existing statutory authority of the Department of Human Services (DHS) to license and regulate residential substance use disorder facilities, pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1975, c.305 (C.26:2B-7 et seq.) which concerns alcohol and P.L.1970, c.334 (C.26:2G-21 et seq.) which concerns narcotic drugs, includes the authority to license and regulate residential substance abuse aftercare facilities such as transitional sober living homes and halfway houses. The bill also provides for criminal history record background checks of a person employed or seeking employment as an administrator of these residential substance abuse facilities, or as a representative payee who receives government benefits on behalf of an individual residing in a facility.  The background checks are also to be conducted on a person who is the owner of the physical plant on which a facility is located.  A person would be disqualified from securing or maintaining a license pursuant to P.L.1975, c.305 (C.26:2B-7 et seq.) or a certificate of approval pursuant to P.L.1970, c.334 (C.26:2G-21 et seq.) if the criminal history record background check of the person who is the owner of the physical plant of the facility or of a person who is employed as an administrator or representative payee at the facility reveals a record of conviction of the crimes or offenses enumerated in the bill. If a person refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, securing a criminal history record background check, DHS is to suspend, deny, revoke, or refuse to renew the license or certificate of approval of the facility.  The criminal history record background checks are to be processed by the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the person who undergoes the background check is to assume the cost of the background check. The bill also provides that the facilities are not to remove a resident from a facility until at least one week following the date of delivery by the facility to the resident of a written notice advising  that the resident is to be removed.  However, this provision would not apply if the resident poses an immediate and serious threat to other residents or the facility.  DHS is also required to conduct inspections every two weeks if there is an investigation for a violation of the laws and regulations governing these facilities or under any other authority. The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in DHS is to oversee the development and maintenance of a registry to collect and track information about the number of openings available for persons seeking residency in these facilities.  The facilities are required to submit to the registry, no less than once a day, information as to the number of openings that are available on that day.  The registry would contain, by county, the following information:  the name, address and telephone number of the facility; the type of services provided; the maximum occupancy; and the number of openings available.  The registry would:  be prominently displayed on the DHS website; provide for a search by county or name; be made available to the public, upon request, through the addictions telephone hotline and the Statewide 2-1-1 telephone system; and also be made available using any other means that the Commissioner of Human Services deems appropriate. Lastly, the bill would update the language used in this area of law, in order to ensure grammatical correctness, maintain consistency with current rules of statutory drafting, and correctly reference the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in DHS, which is the agency and division currently responsible for the regulation of substance use disorder treatment facilities.

No narcotic or drug abuse treatment center, transitional sober living home, halfway house, or other residential aftercare facility shall be permitted to deny admission to a prospective client on the basis that the person is currently receiving medication assisted treatment for a substance use disorder administered by a licensed treatment provider, including but not limited to methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, or any other medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a substance use disorder. The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall, at a minimum, require a transitional sober living home, halfway house, or other residential aftercare facility to provide notice to a patient's spouse, parent, legal guardian, designated next of kin, or other designated emergency contact, whenever the patient voluntarily withdraws, or is involuntarily evicted from, such facility, provided that:  (1) such notice is provided in a manner that is consistent with federal requirements under 42 CFR Part 2 and federal HIPAA requirements under 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164; and (2) the patient, if an adult, has not withheld consent for such notice or expressly requested that notification not be given.  If a patient who is not incapacitated withholds consent for such notice, or expressly requests that notification not be given, the department shall require the patient's wishes to be respected unless the patient is a minor child or adolescent, in which case, the department shall require the minor's parent, legal guardian, designated next of kin, or other designated emergency contact to be notified, provided that such notification is not inconsistent with, and would not violate, federal requirements under 42 CFR Part 2 and federal HIPAA requirements under 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164. (cf:  P.L.2017, c.256, s.2) 4.    Section 1 of P.L.1982, c.149 (C.26:2H-11.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    In the case of an application for a certificate of need or initial licensure, as applicable, for a narcotic and drug abuse treatment center to be located within 500 feet from any building in this State used for the instruction of children between the ages of five and 18 years, the applicant shall notify the governing body of the municipality within which the applicant proposes to locate the treatment center of the applicant's intention to apply for the certificate of need or licensure and the proposed location of the center.

(C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill), that no criminal history record information exists on file in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Identification Division, or in the State Bureau of Identification in the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety, which would: disqualify a person from employment as an administrator or representative payee at the facility; or reveal that an owner of the physical plant of a facility has been convicted of crimes or offenses that would disqualify a person from securing or maintaining a license or certificate of approval for a facility. b.    If an administrator, representative payee, or owner of the physical plant of a facility refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, the securing of a criminal history record background check pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the department shall suspend, deny, revoke, or refuse to renew the license or certificate of approval of a facility, as applicable. 11.  (New section)  In the case of a facility established prior to the effective date of P.L.    , c.

or, as applicable, (2)   the person who is the owner of the physical plant and the facility which is located on the property of the owner, of a person's qualification or disqualification for securing or maintaining a license pursuant to P.L.1975, c.305 (C.26:2B-7 et seq.) or certificate of approval pursuant to P.L.1970, c.334 (C.26:2G-21 et seq.).  The owner shall be notified of the conviction or convictions which constitute the results of the owner's criminal history record background check.  If the results reveal that a person would be disqualified from securing or maintaining a license or certificate of approval, the crimes and offenses shall be identified in the notice to the owner, but shall not be identified in the notice to the facility which is located on the property of the owner. c.     The person who is the subject of the background check shall have 30 days from the date of the written notice of disqualification to petition the commissioner for a hearing on the accuracy of the person's criminal history record information or to establish the person's rehabilitation under subsection b. of section 13 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The commissioner shall notify the person's employer or prospective employer or the person securing or maintaining a license or certificate of approval, as applicable, of the person's petition for a hearing within five days following the receipt of the petition from the person.  Upon the issuance of a final decision on a petition filed with the commissioner pursuant to this subsection, the commissioner shall notify the person and the person's employer or prospective employer or the owner of the physical plant and the person securing or maintaining a license or certificate of approval, as applicable, as to whether the person remains disqualified for employment or whether a person securing or maintaining a license or certificate of approval remains disqualified under P.L.    , c.    (C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). d.    A facility that has received an employment application from a person who is seeking employment as an administrator or representative payee, or that currently employs an administrator or representative payee and: (1)   receives notice from the commissioner that the prospective or current administrator or representative payee has been determined by the commissioner to be disqualified to be an administrator or representative payee;

(2)   the type of services provided by the facility or center; (3)   the maximum occupancy of the facility or center; and (4)   the number of openings available for persons seeking residency, based on the information received pursuant to subsection e. of this section. c.     The information described in subsection b. of this section shall be: (1)   prominently displayed on the website of the department and searchable by county or the name of the facility or center; (2)   made available to the public, upon request, through the addictions telephone hotline and the Statewide 2-1-1 telephone system; and (3)   made available using any other means that the Commissioner of Human Services deems appropriate. d.    The commissioner is authorized to solicit, receive, and accept grants, funds, or anything of value from any public or private entity, and receive and accept contributions of money, property, labor, or any other thing of value from any legitimate source, for the purpose of the development and maintenance of a registry pursuant to this section. e.     Each facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1975, c.305 (C.26:2B-7 et seq.) and each narcotic and drug abuse treatment center issued a certificate of approval pursuant to P.L.1970, c.334 (C.26:2G-21 et seq.) shall submit to the registry developed and maintained pursuant to this section, no less than once a day, information advising of the number of openings that are available in the facility or center on that day. 17.  The Commissioner of Human Services shall, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt any rules and regulations as the commissioner deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this act. 18.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month next following the date of enactment, except the Commissioner of Human Services may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill would amend the States substance use disorder treatment laws in relation to the regulation of sober living homes and halfway houses.  In particular, the bill would expressly clarify that the existing statutory authority of the Department of Human Services (DHS) to license and regulate residential substance use disorder facilities, pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1975, c.305 (C.26:2B-7 et seq.) which concerns alcohol and P.L.1970, c.334 (C.26:2G-21 et seq.) which concerns narcotic drugs, includes the authority to license and regulate residential substance abuse aftercare facilities such as transitional sober living homes and halfway houses. The bill also provides for criminal history record background checks of a person employed or seeking employment as an administrator of these residential substance abuse facilities, or as a representative payee who receives government benefits on behalf of an individual residing in a facility.  The background checks are also to be conducted on a person who is the owner of the physical plant on which a facility is located.  A person would be disqualified from securing or maintaining a license pursuant to P.L.1975, c.305 (C.26:2B-7 et seq.) or a certificate of approval pursuant to P.L.1970, c.334 (C.26:2G-21 et seq.) if the criminal history record background check of the person who is the owner of the physical plant of the facility or of a person who is employed as an administrator or representative payee at the facility reveals a record of conviction of the crimes or offenses enumerated in the bill. If a person refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, securing a criminal history record background check, DHS is to suspend, deny, revoke, or refuse to renew the license or certificate of approval of the facility.  The criminal history record background checks are to be processed by the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the person who undergoes the background check is to assume the cost of the background check. The bill also provides that the facilities are not to remove a resident from a facility until at least one week following the date of delivery by the facility to the resident of a written notice advising  that the resident is to be removed.  However, this provision would not apply if the resident poses an immediate and serious threat to other residents or the facility.  DHS is also required to conduct inspections every two weeks if there is an investigation for a violation of the laws and regulations governing these facilities or under any other authority. The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in DHS is to oversee the development and maintenance of a registry to collect and track information about the number of openings available for persons seeking residency in these facilities.  The facilities are required to submit to the registry, no less than once a day, information as to the number of openings that are available on that day.  The registry would contain, by county, the following information:  the name, address and telephone number of the facility; the type of services provided; the maximum occupancy; and the number of openings available.  The registry would:  be prominently displayed on the DHS website; provide for a search by county or name; be made available to the public, upon request, through the addictions telephone hotline and the Statewide 2-1-1 telephone system; and also be made available using any other means that the Commissioner of Human Services deems appropriate. Lastly, the bill would update the language used in this area of law, in order to ensure grammatical correctness, maintain consistency with current rules of statutory drafting, and correctly reference the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in DHS, which is the agency and division currently responsible for the regulation of substance use disorder treatment facilities.
