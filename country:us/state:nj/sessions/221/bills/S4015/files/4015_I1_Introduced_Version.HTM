Services shall, in accordance with the &quot;Administrative Procedure
Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410&nbsp;(C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt any rules and
regulations as the commissioner deems necessary to carry out the provisions of
this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     18.  This act shall take
effect on the first day of the seventh month next following the date of
enactment, except the Commissioner of Human Services may take any anticipatory
administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation
of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend the
States substance use disorder treatment laws in relation to the regulation of
sober living homes and halfway houses.  In particular, the bill would expressly
clarify that the existing statutory authority of the Department of Human
Services (DHS) to license and regulate residential substance use disorder
facilities, pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1975, c.305 (C.26:2B-7 et seq.)
which concerns alcohol and P.L.1970, c.334 (C.26:2G-21 et seq.) which concerns
narcotic drugs, includes the authority to license and regulate residential
substance abuse aftercare facilities such as transitional sober living homes
and halfway houses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides for
criminal history record background checks of a person employed or seeking
employment as an administrator of these residential substance abuse facilities,
or as a representative payee who receives government benefits on behalf of an
individual residing in a facility.  The background checks are also to be
conducted on a person who is the owner of the physical plant on which a facility
is located.  A person would be disqualified from securing or maintaining a
license pursuant to P.L.1975, c.305&nbsp;(C.26:2B-7 et seq.) or a certificate
of approval pursuant to P.L.1970, c.334 (C.26:2G-21 et seq.) if the criminal
history record background check of the person who is the owner of the physical
plant of the facility or of a person who is employed as an administrator or
representative payee at the facility reveals a record of conviction of the
crimes or offenses enumerated in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a person refuses to consent
to, or cooperate in, securing a criminal history record background check, DHS
is to suspend, deny, revoke, or refuse to renew the license or certificate of
approval of the facility.  The criminal history record background checks are to
be processed by the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and the person who undergoes the background check is to assume
the cost of the background check.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
the facilities are not to remove a resident from a facility until at least one
week following the date of delivery by the facility to the resident of a
written notice advising  that the resident is to be removed.  However, this
provision would not apply if the resident poses an immediate and serious threat
to other residents or the facility.  DHS is also required to conduct
inspections every two weeks if there is an investigation for a violation of the
laws and regulations governing these facilities or under any other authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Division of Mental Health
and Addiction Services in DHS is to oversee the development and maintenance of
a registry to collect and track information about the number of openings
available for persons seeking residency in these facilities.  The facilities
are required to submit to the registry, no less than once a day, information as
to the number of openings that are available on that day.  The registry would
contain, by county, the following information:  the name, address and telephone
number of the facility; the type of services provided; the maximum occupancy;
and the number of openings available.  The registry would:  be prominently
displayed on the DHS website; provide for a search by county or name; be made
available to the public, upon request, through the addictions telephone hotline
and the Statewide 2-1-1 telephone system; and also be made available using any
other means that the Commissioner of Human Services deems appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lastly, the bill would update
the language used in this area of law, in order to ensure grammatical
correctness, maintain consistency with current rules of statutory drafting, and
correctly reference the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in
DHS, which is the agency and division currently responsible for the regulation of
substance use disorder treatment facilities. </p>
