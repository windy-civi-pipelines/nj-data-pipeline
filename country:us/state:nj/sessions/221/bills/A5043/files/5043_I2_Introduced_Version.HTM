and d.  recommendations for schools, early childhood education programs, and child care centers on how to develop and implement a cardiac emergency response plan. 2.  a.  Not later than 20 months after the date of enactment of this act, the Commissioner of Health, in consultation with the Department of Education, shall disseminate the materials and resources developed pursuant to section 1 of this act as follows:  (1) to State educational agencies, as appropriate;

STATEMENT This bill requires the State Department of Health (DOH) to create and disseminate materials and resources related to cardiomyopathy, including a cardiomyopathy risk assessment.  The DOH, in consultation with the Department of Education, would be required to develop public education materials and resources on the signs, symptoms, and risk-factors associated with high-risk cardiac conditions and genetic heart rhythm abnormalities.  These materials and resources would then be disseminated to school administrators, educators, school health professionals, coaches, families, guardians, caregivers, and other appropriate individuals.  The cardiomyopathy risk assessment would be disseminated to the public. With this bill, the DOH would submit an annual report to the Governor and the Legislature detailing existing activities already conducted by the department on the prevalence and epidemiology of cardiomyopathy across the lifespan of an individual, from birth to adulthood, focusing on the natural history of an individual with cardiomyopathy and the estimated number of cardiomyopathy-related emergency department visits in the pediatric and adult population.  The submitted reports would also be made available to the public. This bill would require the DOH apply to any available federal grants to expand and coordinate research and research-related activities associated with cardiomyopathy.  The DOH would be required to submit an annual report to the Governor and the Legislature on the departments research efforts and future plans and needs for cardiomyopathy research. Additionally, this bill sets up a grants program.  Under the program, the commissioner would award grants to eligible public and nonpublic elementary and secondary schools for the following purposes: 1. Developing and providing comprehensive materials to establish AED and CPR programs in public and nonpublic elementary and secondary schools; 2. Providing support for CPR and AED training programs in public and nonpublic elementary and secondary schools for students, staff, and related sports volunteers; 3. Providing support for developing a cardiac emergency response plan within public and nonpublic elementary and secondary schools; 4. Purchasing AEDs, AED batteries, and performing necessary AED maintenance; or 5. Replacing old and outdated AED and CPR equipment, machinery, and educational materials. To receive grant funds, a local educational agency, in consultation with a qualified health care entity, would submit an application to the Commissioner of Health.  If a local educational agency has applied and been awarded federal funds for the same or similar purposes as listed above, the educational agency would need to first utilize the federal funds before applying to the State for any additional funds.
