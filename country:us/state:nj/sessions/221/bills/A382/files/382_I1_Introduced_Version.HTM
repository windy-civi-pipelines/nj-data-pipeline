<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning health insurance and health care
providers and supplementing various parts of the statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known
and may be cited as the Health Care Consumers Out-of-Network Protection,
Transparency, Cost Containment and Accountability Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The health care
delivery system in this State requires reforms that will enhance consumer
protections, create a system to resolve certain health care billing disputes,
contain rising costs, and measure success in achieving these goals;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Despite existing State
and federal laws and regulations to protect against certain surprise
out-of-network charges, these charges continue to pose problems for health care
consumers in New Jersey.  Many consumers are surprised to find bills for
hospital emergency room procedures or for charges by providers that they had no
choice in selecting;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     While the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act added new patient protections requiring
federally-regulated group health plans to reimburse for out-of-network
emergency service by paying the greatest of three possible amounts: (1) the
amount negotiated with in-network providers for the emergency service
furnished; (2) the amount for the emergency service calculated using the same
method the plan generally uses to determine payments for out-of-network
services; or (3) the amount that would be paid under Medicare for the emergency
service, patients continue to face out-of-network charges for surprise bills;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Carriers and consumers
continue to report exorbitant charges by certain health care professionals and
facilities for out-of-network services, including balance billing, and in
certain cases, consumers bills are referred to collection, which contributes
to the increasing costs of health care services,  insurance, and self-insured
employers costs,  and imposes hardships on health care consumers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Health care providers
and hospitals report that inadequate reimbursement from carriers and other
payers is causing financial stress on safety net hospitals, deteriorating
morale among providers and reduced quality of care for consumers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Approximately 70
percent of individuals with health benefits are in self-funded plans, in which
the employer pays the claims directly without shifting the risk to insurance
companies.  Most employers work through licensed third party administrators,
which disburse the funds to pay claims.  Third party administrators have their
own networks, whether preferred provider organizations or exclusive provider
organizations, with which they contract in order to receive a more favorable
rate for their clients.  Physicians and facilities, however, do not necessarily
know what employer is affiliated with any given network that they are in;
therefore, it is necessary for the physicians and health care facilities to
know if they are in a network utilized by a particular employer when a patient
presents himself for health care services and the identification card contains
the name of the employer rather than a recognizable insurer.  Therefore, a
physician or health care facility cannot give proper notification to a
patient.  It is therefore necessary that physicians and healthcare facilities
have full knowledge of the network arrangements of third party administrators
or employers that pay claims directly in order that physicians and health care
facilities can comply with the provisions of this act;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    It is, therefore, in the
public interest to reform the economics of the health care delivery system in
New Jersey to enhance consumer protections, create a system to resolve certain
health care billing disputes, contain rising costs, and measure success with
respect to these goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    For the purposes of this
act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Carrier means an insurer
licensed to write health insurance in this State under Title 17 of the Revised
Statutes or Title 17B of the New Jersey Statutes and a health maintenance
organization licensed pursuant to P.L.1973, c.337 (C.26:2J-1 et seq.), or a
carrier acting as a third party administrator on behalf of an employer or other
entity under a self-funded plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commissioner means the
Commissioner of Banking and Insurance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Covered person means a
person on whose behalf a carrier, an employer, or a third party administrator
is obligated to pay health care expense benefits or provide health care
services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Department means the
Department of Banking and Insurance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Emergency or urgent basis
means all emergency and urgent care services including, but not limited to, the
services required pursuant to N.J.A.C.11:24-5.3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Employer means and includes
a self-funded business or other entity that pays claims directly without using
a licensed third party administrator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Facility-based provider
means a physician or other provider who provides health care services to
patients who are in an inpatient or ambulatory care facility, including
services such as pathology, anesthesiology, emergency room care, radiology or
other services provided in an inpatient or ambulatory care facility setting,
which services are typically arranged by the facility by contract or agreement
with the facility-based provider as part of the facilitys general business
operations, wherein a covered person or the covered persons health benefits
plan generally does not specifically select or have a choice of providers from

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     19.    a. A carrier, employer,
and third party administrator shall provide a written notice to each covered
person, in a form and manner to be prescribed by the commissioner, of the
protections provided to covered persons pursuant to this act.  The notice shall
include information on how a consumer can contact the department or the
appropriate regulatory agency to report and dispute an out-of-network charge. 
The notice required pursuant to this section shall be posted on a carriers
website.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commissioner shall
provide a notice on the departments website containing information for consumers
relating to the protections provided by this act, information on how consumers
can report and file complaints with the department or the appropriate
regulatory agency relating to any out-of-network charges, and information and
guidance for consumers regarding peer reviews  filed pursuant to this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     20.    a.  It shall be a
violation of this act for an out-of-network health care provider, directly or
indirectly related to a claim, to knowingly waive, rebate, give, pay, or offer
to waive, rebate, give or pay all or part of the deductible, copayment, or
coinsurance owed by a covered person pursuant to the terms of the covered
persons health benefits plan as an inducement for the covered person to seek
health care services from that provider.  As the commissioner shall prescribe
by regulation, a pattern of waiving, rebating, giving or paying all or part of
the deductible, copayment or coinsurance by a provider shall be considered an
inducement for the purposes of this subsection.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    This section shall not
apply to any waiver, rebate, gift, payment, or offer that falls within a safe
harbor under federal laws related to fraud and abuse concerning patient
cost-sharing, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback, self-referral,
false claims, and civil monetary penalties, including any advisory opinions
issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or the Office of
Inspector General pertaining to those laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     21.  This bill shall take
effect on the 60th day next following enactment, but the Governor, the State
Board of Medical Examiners, and the Department of Banking and Insurance may
take such anticipatory action prior to that time as deemed necessary to
effectuate the provisions of the act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is intended to
provide remedies for individuals who are treated by physicians and treated in
facilities that do not belong to a provider network used by the individuals
health benefits plan and who are consequently billed for the balance of charges
that are not paid for by their health benefits plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to provide such
services and to provide transparency in the health care system, the bill
requires that at the time a non-emergency medical procedure or other health
care service is scheduled for a covered person, a physician must disclose to
the patient whether or not he is a participating physician in the health
benefits plan in which the covered person is a member.  If the physician is a
non-participating physician, the covered person will have the option of either
finding an alternative physician or selecting the non-participating physician. 
If the patient knowingly selects a non-participating physician, the physician
would be required to provide a written estimate of the probable cost of the
procedure or service, not including unforeseen medical circumstances that may
arise when the procedure or service is provided.  The non-participating
physician must secure the written assent of the patient to pay any balance that
is in excess of the amount paid by the persons health benefits plan.  The
covered person must be informed that he will have a financial responsibility
with respect to the services that are provided.  The physician also has to
provide the covered person with information regarding any other physician or
group of physicians whose ancillary services are to be utilized by the
attending physician, as well as information as to how the patient can determine
whether the ancillary physician or physicians are in the patients network,
thus avoiding what has been called surprise balance billing.   The same
requirements would apply to hospitals, which would have to inform patients that
their facility-based physicians, including staff physicians, radiologists, and
anesthesiologists who bill separately, may not be in the patients health
benefits plan network. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The disclosure provisions will
not apply in any case in which the treatment takes place on an emergency or
urgent basis; in that case the physician or hospital cannot require the patient
to pay any amount in excess of whatever reimbursement was made by his health
benefits plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     While physicians and health
care facilities clearly know if they are in a network organized by an insurance
carrier, nearly 70 percent of individuals covered by health benefits plans in
the State are in self-insured plans, in which their employers are paying the
claims out of its own funds, assuming all of the risk themselves.  Self-insured
plans are almost always administered by licensed third party administrators,
although a few employers process the claims themselves.  These administrators
contract with networks of physicians and health care facilities, including
preferred provider organizations, to provide health care services at a reduced
rate, much as health insurers do with their networks.   Because of this, a
physician or health care facility would not necessarily know if they are a
member of a network used by an independent third party administrator; often the
health benefits card carries the name of the employer rather than a
recognizable insurance company or third party administrator.  Because the bill
requires disclosure of network status by all physicians and health care
facilities, it requires third party administrators to notify every physician or
facility that is in a network that they use with the name of the
administrators employer clients so that a physician or facility will be
alerted that they are in a network of a health benefits plan of a patient
working for a specific employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event that a patient or
insurer or third party administrator receives a balance bill from a physician
or facility, the bill provides two peer review mechanisms  one for physicians
and one for health care facilities.  The physicians peer review panel,
established in the Physicians Medical Bill Dispute Resolution Review Program
and located in the State Board of Medical Examiners, consists of 21 physicians
of different specialties, appointed by the Governor.  The health care
facilities peer review panel, the Health Care Facilities Medical Bill Dispute Resolution
Program, will be comprised of a board of 11 members representing health care
facilities located in this State, who shall be appointed by the Governor in
consultation with the New Jersey Hospital Association.  A panel of three
physicians or facilities will be assigned to each case.  The bill does not
provide for so-called baseball-style arbitration, in which an all-or-nothing
award is made relative to a disputed amount, but rather sets forth a number of
criteria that should be considered by the peer review panel, and permits the
panel to award any amount it would determine to be fair.  The decision of the
panel would be determinative.</p>
