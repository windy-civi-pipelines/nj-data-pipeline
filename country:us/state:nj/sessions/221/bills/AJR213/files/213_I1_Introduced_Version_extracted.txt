The DOGE will consist of the State Auditor, or a designee, who will serve as chairperson, and up to 20 members of the public who will be selected and appointed by the Delegation on Government Efficiency Selection Committee.  The selection committee will include the following members: (1)   the Governor, or a designee; (2)   the President of the Senate, or a designee; (3)   the Speaker of the General Assembly, or a designee; (4)   the Minority Leader of the Senate, or a designee; and (5)   the Minority Leader of the General Assembly, or a designee. The selection committee will select and appoint public members of the DOGE from among qualified persons who submit applications to the selection committee for membership on the DOGE.  An applicant will require the approval of at least four members of the selection committee to be selected and appointed to the DOGE.  This ensures bipartisan agreement.
