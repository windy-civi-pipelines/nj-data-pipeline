Competitive Credit Adjustment The bill provides that if a neighboring state offers larger tax credit awards for film production purposes compared to New Jersey, then the tax credit awards issued for certain film productions are to be increased under the program.  Specifically, if a state contiguous to this State offers tax credits in an amount equal to or greater than the amounts allowed under the program, as measured by the percentage of eligible expenses, then the amount of the tax credits allowed for productions that occur in one or more counties located, in whole or in part, within a 30-mile radius of the intersection of Eighth Avenue/Central Park West, Broadway, and West 59th Street/Central Park South, New York, New York would be increased to no less than 45 percent of the qualified film production expenses of the taxpayer.  This amount would be five percent more than the tax credits allowed for a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company. Incentive to Relocate Television Series to New Jersey This bill provides that a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company is eligible for an additional tax credit in an amount equal to five percent of the taxpayers qualified film production expenses incurred during a taxable period commencing on or after July 1, 2025 but before July 1, 2049 for a film that is a television series that relocated to New Jersey.  The bill defines television series that relocated to New Jersey to mean a scripted television series of 22 minutes or more in length per episode, with a minimum budget production budget of $2,500,000 per episode, and for which all prior seasons of the series were filmed outside New Jersey. New Jersey Film-Lease Post-Production Company The bill defines a New Jersey film-lease post-production company to mean a taxpayer, including any taxpayer that is a member of combined group or any other entity in which the New Jersey film-lease post-production company has a material ownership interest and a material operational role in the production, that otherwise complies with the eligibility requirements of the program, has made a commitment to lease or otherwise occupy production space a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, and satisfies certain criteria set forth in the bill. If a New Jersey film-lease partner facility has not received a temporary or final certificate of occupancy, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company is required to have entered into a lease or sublease with the owner or developer of a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, which lease or sublease is for not less than three years of occupancy of the New Jersey film-lease partner facility and includes at least 36,000 square feet of gross rentable space.  For purposes of satisfying certain provisions in the bill, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company may include in an application the qualified digital media content production expenses incurred for postproduction services, including visual effects services that are performed by any other member of a New Jersey film-lease production companys combined group. Application and Carry Forward of Credit This bill amends current law to provide an exception to the statutory minimum corporate business tax liability for the recipient of a film or digital media content production tax credit.  Under the bill, a credit awarded for application against the corporate business tax may be claimed as a refundable tax credit. Under current law, a taxpayers gross income tax liability may not be reduced to an amount less than zero by the credits awarded under the program.  This bill provides that the tax liability may be reduced to less than zero, in which case the taxpayer may elect to receive a refund or carry forward the unused credit for use in a successive tax period. Additionally, the bill provides that a taxpayer, including the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate, may use the credit in the tax period for which it was issued, the tax period in which it was issued, or in a successive tax period after the tax period for which it was issued, without the need to amend the return for the year for which the credit was issued. Maximum Credit Availability Under current law, in fiscal year 2024 and in each fiscal year thereafter until the conclusion of the program, the cumulative total awards are limited to $150 million for New Jersey studio partners and $150 million for New Jersey film-lease production companies.  The authority may, in its discretion, award an additional $400 million to New Jersey studio partners and an additional $250 million to New Jersey film-lease production companies. This bill amends current law so that, beginning in fiscal year 2026, the maximum cumulative total awards are increased to $300 million for New Jersey studio partners and $250 million for New Jersey film-lease production companies.  In addition, the bill decreases the additional discretionary awards to $250 million for New Jersey studio partners and $150 million for New Jersey film-lease production companies. Recapture of Tax Credits and Termination Under current law, the approval of tax credits for New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies is subject to award agreements with the authority detailing obligations of the awardee and outcomes relating to events of default, including, but not limited to, the recapture of tax credits.  The bill provides that the recapture of tax credits may only apply to the initial recipient of the tax credits, not the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate. Current law also provides that if a New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period, the authority is required to recapture certain portions of the tax credit.  This bill provides an exception for any circumstance in which the New Jersey studio partners failure to occupy the production facility is for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey studio partner.  Additionally, the bill permits the authority, rather than requires the authority, to recapture under appropriate conditions. The bill provides that if a New Jersey film-lease production company fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey film lease production company for the duration of the commitment period or otherwise fails to satisfy the conditions for designation as a New Jersey film-lease production company, except not including the failure to occupy the production facility for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey film-lease production company, the authority may recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayers designation as a New Jersey film-lease production company.  In addition, the bill requires that all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for which the authority has not approved final documentation, terminate in this instance. New Jersey Film-Lease Production Company Supplemental Report Under current law, a New Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report within two years after the production concludes.  This bill also permits a New Jersey film-lease production company to do the same if it satisfies the criteria required for a New Jersey film-lease production company before a temporary or final certificate of occupancy is received by the New Jersey film-lease partner facility. Expansion of Tax Credit Applicability Under current law, tax credits awarded under the program may be applied against a taxpayers liability under the gross income tax or corporation business tax.  In addition, this bill authorizes the application of these credits against a taxpayers liability for an insurance premium tax. New Jersey Promotional Credit In addition to the amount of tax credits otherwise allowed under the program, the bill allows an additional promotional tax credit for certain film productions in an amount equal to two percent of a taxpayers qualified film production expenses or qualified digital media content production expenses under certain conditions.  Specifically, a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film lease production company may qualify for this additional credit by submitting, alongside an application to the authority and the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury (director), a plan outlining specific goals to New Jersey.  Under the bill, a taxpayer is required to include at least two promotional criteria in the plan, and the authority and director are required to verify that the taxpayer has met the goals outlined in its plan. Specifically, a taxpayer is required to satisfy at least two of the following promotional criteria to qualify for the additional promotional credit: (1)  the creation of a video at least five minutes in length of publicly accessible locations in New Jersey used for the film, with commentary on how and why each location was chosen, published on the Internet website promoting the film or in another form and manner approved by the authority.  To receive credit for this promotional criterion, a taxpayer is to provide a list of locations in New Jersey used for the film and relevant footage for use by the authority for promotional purposes; (2)  the creation of five public social media posts including commentary on positive experiences at accessible New Jersey locations or positive experiences filming in the State, using an official account of the taxpayer or the film, or as otherwise permitted by the authority.  To receive credit for this promotional criterion, the taxpayer is to provide the Internet website on which the post is publicly visible for use by the authority for promotional purposes; (3)  the placement of a New Jersey promotional logo provided by the authority for a two-second exposure, not displayed over content or on a shared card, and displayed before the below-the-line crew crawl; (4)  a reference to the State in the film, which is set, at least in part, in New Jersey; and (5)  any alternative criteria as the authority provides. Credit for Diversity Plan Under current law, a taxpayer who is eligible for tax credits under the program may receive an additional credit in an amount equal to two percent of the qualified film production expenses or four percent of the digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer during a tax period if: (1) the application is accompanied by a diversity plan outlining specific goals, which may include advertising and recruitment actions, for hiring minority persons and women; (2) the director and the authority have approved the plan as meeting the requirements established by the director and the authority; and (3) the director and the authority have verified that the applicant has met or made good faith efforts in achieving those goals. Current law provides that a tax credit for four percent of qualified film production expenses may be available to a taxpayer, rather than two percent, if the diversity plan includes specific goals that include hiring persons as performers in the film who are: (1) women or members of a minority group; (2) residents of New Jersey for at least 12 months preceding the beginning of filming or recording; and (3) members of a bona fide labor union representing film and television performers. This bill removes the additional requirements necessary for a taxpayer to receive a four percent tax credit, rather than two percent.  Under the bill, a taxpayer may earn a credit equal to four percent of qualified film production expenses for a diversity plan meeting the same criteria required for a credit equal to four percent of digital media content production expenses. Modification of Definitions This bill amends the definition of commitment period for New Jersey studio partners under the program to be the period beginning with the commencement of the eligibility period and continuing for a minimum of 10 years following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or commencement of a lease term, as appropriate. Under current law, the commitment period expires 10 years following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or commencement of a lease term. The bill also amends the definition of eligibility period, in the case of a taxpayer leasing a production facility, to mean the period beginning at the commencement of the lease term for the production facility leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and extending thereafter for a term of not less than 10 years.  Under current law, the term is limited to a maximum of 10 years. The bill modifies the definition of qualified film production expenses, as it applies to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies, to include: the total script costs of any script written within New Jersey; or the product of the total script costs and the percentage of the principal photography shoot days in New Jersey relative to the total principal photography shoot days for the film.  Under current law, script costs are not included in qualified film production expenses.

If a New Jersey film-lease production company fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey film lease production company for the duration of the commitment period or otherwise fails to satisfy the conditions for designation as a New Jersey film-lease production company, except not including the failure to occupy the production facility for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey film-lease production company, the authority may recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayers designation as a New Jersey film-lease production company, and all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for which the authority has not approved final documentation, shall terminate.  In the event the authority determines that a New Jersey film-lease production company has failed to meet the qualifications of a New Jersey film-lease production company or otherwise comply with the provisions of this section, the authority may recapture from that film production company the portion of any tax credit that had been awarded to that film production company that was only available to the film production company by virtue of the film production company's designation as a New Jersey film-lease production company, except that the tax credits shall not be recaptured from the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate. New Jersey film-lease post-production company means a taxpayer, including any taxpayer that is a member of combined group pursuant to section 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-4.11) or any other entity in which the New Jersey film-lease post-production company has a material ownership interest and a material operational role in the production, that otherwise complies with the eligibility requirements of the Film and Digital Media Tax Credit Program, has made a commitment to lease or otherwise occupy production space a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, and satisfies the criteria of paragraph (3) of subsection b. of this section.  If a New Jersey film-lease partner facility has not received a temporary or final certificate of occupancy, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company shall have entered into a lease or sublease with the owner or developer of a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, which lease or sublease is for not less than three years of occupancy of the New Jersey film-lease partner facility and includes at least 36,000 square feet of gross rentable space.  For purposes of satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (a) of paragraph (3) of subsection b. of this section, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company may include in an application the qualified digital media content production expenses incurred for postproduction services, including visual effects services that are performed by any other member of a New Jersey film-lease production companys combined group, pursuant to section 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-4.11). If a New Jersey film-lease post-production company fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey film-lease post-production company, except not including the failure to occupy the production facility for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey film-lease post-production company, the authority may recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayers designation as a New Jersey film-lease post-production company, and all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for which the authority has not approved final documentation, shall terminate. In the event that the authority determines that a New Jersey film-lease post-production company has failed to meet the qualifications of a New Jersey film-lease post-production company or otherwise comply with the provisions of this section, the authority may recapture from that film production company the portion of any tax credits that had been awarded to that film production company that was only available to the film production company by virtue of the film production companys designation as a New Jersey film-lease post-production company, except that the tax credits shall not be recaptured from the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate. "New Jersey studio partner" means a film production company that has made a commitment to produce films or commercial audiovisual products in New Jersey and has developed, purchased, or executed a 10-year contract to lease a production facility of 250,000 square feet or more, or has executed a purchase contract with a governmental authority for the purpose of developing a production facility of 250,000 square feet or more within 48 months from the date of designation as a New Jersey studio partner; provided, however, the board, in its discretion, may extend the time to execute a purchase contract for an additional 12 months.  Effective upon designation as a New Jersey studio partner, a film production company shall be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section, provided the film production company otherwise complies with the eligibility requirements of Film and Digital Media Tax Credit Program.  In the event the authority determines that a film production company has failed to meet the qualifications of a New Jersey studio partner or otherwise comply with the provisions of this section, the authority may rescind the New Jersey studio partner designation and may recapture from that film production company the portion of any tax credit that had been awarded to that film production company that was only available to the film production company by virtue of the film production company's designation as a New Jersey studio partner, except that the tax credits shall not be recaptured from the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate.  A "New Jersey studio partner" may include any other member of a taxpayer's combined group, pursuant to [P.L.2018, c.131] section 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-4.11), or an unrelated entity principally engaged in the production of a film or other commercial audiovisual product with whom a designated New Jersey studio partner contracts to perform film production services on its behalf or for its benefit such that the designated New Jersey studio partner:  (1) controls such film or product during pre-production, production, and post-production; or (2) controls distribution rights for the resulting film or other commercial audiovisual product, provided that the New Jersey studio partner contracted with the unrelated entity prior to qualified film production expenses being incurred.  No more than three film production companies may be designated as a New Jersey studio partner.

STATEMENT This bill revises certain provisions of the film and digital media content production tax credit program (program) administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.  Among other changes, the bill extends the programs availability until July 2049, ten years longer than it is available under current law. Increased Tax Credit Awards This bill increases the amount of tax credits that may be awarded to a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company under the program, from 35 percent to 40 percent of the taxpayers qualified film production expenses during a tax period, when the expenses are incurred for services performed and tangible personal property purchased for use at a sound stage or other location within the State and within a 30-mile radius of the intersection of Eighth Avenue/Central Park West, Broadway, and West 59th Street/Central Park South, New York, New York. Competitive Credit Adjustment The bill provides that if a neighboring state offers larger tax credit awards for film production purposes compared to New Jersey, then the tax credit awards issued for certain film productions are to be increased under the program.  Specifically, if a state contiguous to this State offers tax credits in an amount equal to or greater than the amounts allowed under the program, as measured by the percentage of eligible expenses, then the amount of the tax credits allowed for productions that occur in one or more counties located, in whole or in part, within a 30-mile radius of the intersection of Eighth Avenue/Central Park West, Broadway, and West 59th Street/Central Park South, New York, New York would be increased to no less than 45 percent of the qualified film production expenses of the taxpayer.  This amount would be five percent more than the tax credits allowed for a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company. Incentive to Relocate Television Series to New Jersey This bill provides that a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company is eligible for an additional tax credit in an amount equal to five percent of the taxpayers qualified film production expenses incurred during a taxable period commencing on or after July 1, 2025 but before July 1, 2049 for a film that is a television series that relocated to New Jersey.  The bill defines television series that relocated to New Jersey to mean a scripted television series of 22 minutes or more in length per episode, with a minimum budget production budget of $2,500,000 per episode, and for which all prior seasons of the series were filmed outside New Jersey. New Jersey Film-Lease Post-Production Company The bill defines a New Jersey film-lease post-production company to mean a taxpayer, including any taxpayer that is a member of combined group or any other entity in which the New Jersey film-lease post-production company has a material ownership interest and a material operational role in the production, that otherwise complies with the eligibility requirements of the program, has made a commitment to lease or otherwise occupy production space a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, and satisfies certain criteria set forth in the bill. If a New Jersey film-lease partner facility has not received a temporary or final certificate of occupancy, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company is required to have entered into a lease or sublease with the owner or developer of a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, which lease or sublease is for not less than three years of occupancy of the New Jersey film-lease partner facility and includes at least 36,000 square feet of gross rentable space.  For purposes of satisfying certain provisions in the bill, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company may include in an application the qualified digital media content production expenses incurred for postproduction services, including visual effects services that are performed by any other member of a New Jersey film-lease production companys combined group. Application and Carry Forward of Credit This bill amends current law to provide an exception to the statutory minimum corporate business tax liability for the recipient of a film or digital media content production tax credit.  Under the bill, a credit awarded for application against the corporate business tax may be claimed as a refundable tax credit. Under current law, a taxpayers gross income tax liability may not be reduced to an amount less than zero by the credits awarded under the program.  This bill provides that the tax liability may be reduced to less than zero, in which case the taxpayer may elect to receive a refund or carry forward the unused credit for use in a successive tax period. Additionally, the bill provides that a taxpayer, including the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate, may use the credit in the tax period for which it was issued, the tax period in which it was issued, or in a successive tax period after the tax period for which it was issued, without the need to amend the return for the year for which the credit was issued. Maximum Credit Availability Under current law, in fiscal year 2024 and in each fiscal year thereafter until the conclusion of the program, the cumulative total awards are limited to $150 million for New Jersey studio partners and $150 million for New Jersey film-lease production companies.  The authority may, in its discretion, award an additional $400 million to New Jersey studio partners and an additional $250 million to New Jersey film-lease production companies. This bill amends current law so that, beginning in fiscal year 2026, the maximum cumulative total awards are increased to $300 million for New Jersey studio partners and $250 million for New Jersey film-lease production companies.  In addition, the bill decreases the additional discretionary awards to $250 million for New Jersey studio partners and $150 million for New Jersey film-lease production companies. Recapture of Tax Credits and Termination Under current law, the approval of tax credits for New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies is subject to award agreements with the authority detailing obligations of the awardee and outcomes relating to events of default, including, but not limited to, the recapture of tax credits.  The bill provides that the recapture of tax credits may only apply to the initial recipient of the tax credits, not the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate. Current law also provides that if a New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period, the authority is required to recapture certain portions of the tax credit.  This bill provides an exception for any circumstance in which the New Jersey studio partners failure to occupy the production facility is for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey studio partner.  Additionally, the bill permits the authority, rather than requires the authority, to recapture under appropriate conditions. The bill provides that if a New Jersey film-lease production company fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey film lease production company for the duration of the commitment period or otherwise fails to satisfy the conditions for designation as a New Jersey film-lease production company, except not including the failure to occupy the production facility for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey film-lease production company, the authority may recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayers designation as a New Jersey film-lease production company.  In addition, the bill requires that all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for which the authority has not approved final documentation, terminate in this instance. New Jersey Film-Lease Production Company Supplemental Report Under current law, a New Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report within two years after the production concludes.  This bill also permits a New Jersey film-lease production company to do the same if it satisfies the criteria required for a New Jersey film-lease production company before a temporary or final certificate of occupancy is received by the New Jersey film-lease partner facility. Expansion of Tax Credit Applicability Under current law, tax credits awarded under the program may be applied against a taxpayers liability under the gross income tax or corporation business tax.  In addition, this bill authorizes the application of these credits against a taxpayers liability for an insurance premium tax. New Jersey Promotional Credit In addition to the amount of tax credits otherwise allowed under the program, the bill allows an additional promotional tax credit for certain film productions in an amount equal to two percent of a taxpayers qualified film production expenses or qualified digital media content production expenses under certain conditions.  Specifically, a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film lease production company may qualify for this additional credit by submitting, alongside an application to the authority and the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury (director), a plan outlining specific goals to New Jersey.  Under the bill, a taxpayer is required to include at least two promotional criteria in the plan, and the authority and director are required to verify that the taxpayer has met the goals outlined in its plan. Specifically, a taxpayer is required to satisfy at least two of the following promotional criteria to qualify for the additional promotional credit: (1)  the creation of a video at least five minutes in length of publicly accessible locations in New Jersey used for the film, with commentary on how and why each location was chosen, published on the Internet website promoting the film or in another form and manner approved by the authority.  To receive credit for this promotional criterion, a taxpayer is to provide a list of locations in New Jersey used for the film and relevant footage for use by the authority for promotional purposes; (2)  the creation of five public social media posts including commentary on positive experiences at accessible New Jersey locations or positive experiences filming in the State, using an official account of the taxpayer or the film, or as otherwise permitted by the authority.  To receive credit for this promotional criterion, the taxpayer is to provide the Internet website on which the post is publicly visible for use by the authority for promotional purposes; (3)  the placement of a New Jersey promotional logo provided by the authority for a two-second exposure, not displayed over content or on a shared card, and displayed before the below-the-line crew crawl; (4)  a reference to the State in the film, which is set, at least in part, in New Jersey; and (5)  any alternative criteria as the authority provides. Credit for Diversity Plan Under current law, a taxpayer who is eligible for tax credits under the program may receive an additional credit in an amount equal to two percent of the qualified film production expenses or four percent of the digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer during a tax period if: (1) the application is accompanied by a diversity plan outlining specific goals, which may include advertising and recruitment actions, for hiring minority persons and women; (2) the director and the authority have approved the plan as meeting the requirements established by the director and the authority; and (3) the director and the authority have verified that the applicant has met or made good faith efforts in achieving those goals. Current law provides that a tax credit for four percent of qualified film production expenses may be available to a taxpayer, rather than two percent, if the diversity plan includes specific goals that include hiring persons as performers in the film who are: (1) women or members of a minority group; (2) residents of New Jersey for at least 12 months preceding the beginning of filming or recording; and (3) members of a bona fide labor union representing film and television performers. This bill removes the additional requirements necessary for a taxpayer to receive a four percent tax credit, rather than two percent.  Under the bill, a taxpayer may earn a credit equal to four percent of qualified film production expenses for a diversity plan meeting the same criteria required for a credit equal to four percent of digital media content production expenses. Modification of Definitions This bill amends the definition of commitment period for New Jersey studio partners under the program to be the period beginning with the commencement of the eligibility period and continuing for a minimum of 10 years following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or commencement of a lease term, as appropriate. Under current law, the commitment period expires 10 years following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or commencement of a lease term. The bill also amends the definition of eligibility period, in the case of a taxpayer leasing a production facility, to mean the period beginning at the commencement of the lease term for the production facility leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and extending thereafter for a term of not less than 10 years.  Under current law, the term is limited to a maximum of 10 years. The bill modifies the definition of qualified film production expenses, as it applies to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies, to include: the total script costs of any script written within New Jersey; or the product of the total script costs and the percentage of the principal photography shoot days in New Jersey relative to the total principal photography shoot days for the film.  Under current law, script costs are not included in qualified film production expenses.
