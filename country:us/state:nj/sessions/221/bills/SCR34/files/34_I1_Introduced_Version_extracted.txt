INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This amendment dedicates money from motor vehicle fees and surcharges to support State transit operations.  Currently, motor vehicle fees and surcharges are split between the Motor Vehicle Commission and the General Fund.  The portion received by the Motor Vehicle Commission is used for its operations.  The portion received by the General Fund may be used for any State purpose. This amendment does not change the funding that is kept by the Motor Vehicle Commission for its operations.  This amendment limits the amount of money from motor vehicle fees and surcharges received by the General Fund to about $500 million per year.  The rest of the money from motor vehicle fees and surcharges would be used for transit operations. The amendment provides that the State transit system will receive the amount of money remaining from motor vehicle fees and surcharges after subtracting both: (1) the amount of money retained by the Motor Vehicle Commission for its operations; and (2) the amount from these fees and surcharges that was received by the General Fund in fiscal year 2018.  In any given year, it is possible that there will be no money remaining from motor vehicle fees and surcharges after subtracting these two amounts. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution proposes to amend the State Constitution to dedicate a portion of revenue from motor vehicle fees and surcharges to the State transit system.  For each fiscal year commencing after the effective date of the amendment, the amendment requires the Legislature to appropriate to the operations of the New Jersey Transit Corporation, or to any other public corporation established by the Legislature for the purpose of providing efficient, coordinated, safe, and responsive public transportation and with the power to acquire and operate public transportation assets, at minimum, an amount equal to the revenue from motor vehicle fees and surcharges collected in that fiscal year that is in excess of the revenue remitted to the General Fund from those motor vehicle fees and surcharges for Fiscal Year 2018 and the amount to be retained by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission for its own operations in that fiscal year.
