<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the Chief
Administrator (chief administrator) of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission
(commission) to issue special windshield stickers for electric vehicles that
are owned or leased and registered in New Jersey to indicate that the electric
vehicles are exempt from emission inspections.  The bill defines electric
vehicle to mean any vehicle powered solely by electric without an on-board
engine or generator, and that does not use a hydrocarbon fuel to create
electricity.  Electric vehicle includes a plug-in electric, but not plug-in
hybrid electric, or solar-powered vehicle.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the windshield
stickers are to be designed by the chief administrator, in consultation with
the Director of the Division of Highway Traffic Safety in the Department of Law
and Public Safety (director).  There is to be no fee for the issuance of the windshield
stickers.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The windshield stickers are
required to be displayed in a manner prescribed by the chief administrator, in
consultation with the director, and to be clearly visible to law enforcement
officers.  The windshield stickers are required to be removed and returned to
the commission within 30 days of the date that the ownership or leasehold
period of the vehicle has ended.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the chief
administrator, in consultation with the director, to adopt regulations specifying
the size, placement, and other formal requirements or additional safeguards as
the chief administrator deems necessary for the issuance and display of the windshield
stickers.   </p>
