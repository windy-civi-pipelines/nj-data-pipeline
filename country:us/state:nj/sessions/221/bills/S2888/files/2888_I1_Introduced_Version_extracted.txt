STATEMENT This bill allows corporation business tax and gross income tax credits to businesses that employ qualified persons with developmental disabilities.  The amount of each credit would be equal to 40 percent of the first $6,000 of wages paid to the qualified person with a developmental disability, a maximum of $2,400 per qualified person with a developmental disability.

These State tax credits are modeled on the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which encourages employers to hire targeted groups of employees, including certain persons with developmental disabilities.  Under the federal WOTC, employers may claim a federal tax credit of up to 40 percent of the first $6,000 earned by the employee, or $2,400. According to the sponsor, the tax credits allowed under this bill would encourage businesses to employ qualified persons with developmental disabilities, who often face barriers to employment.
