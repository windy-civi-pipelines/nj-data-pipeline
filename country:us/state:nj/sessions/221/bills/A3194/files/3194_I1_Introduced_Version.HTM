class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning infectious disease control and
prevention in long-term care facilities and supplementing Title 26 of the
Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Infectious disease means a
disease caused by a living organism or other pathogen, including a fungus,
bacteria, parasite, protozoan, virus, or prion.  An infectious disease may, or
may not, be transmissible from person to person, animal to person, or insect to
person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Long-term care facility
means a nursing home, assisted living residence, comprehensive personal care
home, residential health care facility, or dementia care home licensed pursuant
to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Rapid-result test means a
test for active infection with an infectious disease, the results of which are,
to the extent possible, available within 24 hours after the test is
administered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    During an outbreak,
epidemic, or pandemic of an infectious disease affecting or likely to affect
one or more long-term care facilities:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     All staff employed by
or providing services at an affected long-term care facility shall be tested
for active infection with the infectious disease at least once per week and
immediately upon showing any signs or symptoms of having contracted the
infectious disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    No later than seven days
after the date a state of emergency or public health emergency, if any, is
declared in response to the outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic of the infectious
disease or as soon as rapid-result testing for the infectious disease becomes
available, all long-term care facilities in the State shall have access to
rapid-result testing for the infectious disease, as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   For long-term care
facilities with more than 100 authorized resident beds, the facility shall have
sufficient on-site rapid-result testing resources available to make the test
available to all staff, residents, and first-time visitors at the facility. 
The facility may seek reimbursement for the cost of administering and
processing the test from a staff members or residents health benefits plan;
provided that in no case shall the facility charge a staff member or resident
for any portion of the cost of a rapid-result test that is not covered by a
health benefits plan, if the test was conducted pursuant to subsection a. of
this section.  For any test not conducted pursuant to subsection a. of this
section, the facility may seek reimbursement from the staff member or resident
in an amount equal to the actual cost to the facility of administering and
processing the test; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   For long-term care
facilities with 100 or fewer authorized resident beds, subject to the
provisions of subsection c. of this section, the facility shall have access to
rapid-result testing for the infectious disease for staff, residents, and
first-time visitors at the facility through the county board of health for the
county in which the facility is located.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)  No later than
seven days after the date a state of emergency or public health emergency, if
any, is declared in response to the outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic of the
infectious disease or as soon as rapid-result testing for the infectious
disease becomes available, each county board of health shall obtain and make
available to staff, residents, and first-time visitors at long-term care
facilities located in the county that have 100 or fewer authorized beds, as
well as to members of the public residing in that county, a rapid-result test for
the infectious disease.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In situations where the
current or anticipated demand for rapid-result test resources through the
county board of health exceeds the county board of healths current supply of
test resources, the county board of health shall prioritize tests as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   tests shall first be
made available to staff and residents of long-term care facilities with fewer
than 100 beds when the staff member or resident currently exhibit signs or
symptoms of the infectious disease or was recently exposed to the infectious
disease; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   if the county board of
health can satisfy current and anticipated demand for rapid-result tests under
subparagraph (a) of this paragraph from available testing resources, the county
board of health may make rapid-result tests available to staff members of
long-term care facilities with 100 or fewer authorized beds for the purposes of
performing weekly tests for the infectious disease as provided in subsection a.
of this section, as well as for performing other medically-indicated tests for
the infectious disease among staff members of long-term care facilities; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   if the county board of
health can satisfy current and anticipated demand for rapid-result tests under
both subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph from available testing
resources, the county board of health may make rapid-result tests available on
a first-come, first served basis to first-time visitors to a long-term care
facility with 100 or fewer authorized beds that is located in the county, as
well as to any resident of the county.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   County boards of health
may charge a reasonable fee for the administration of a rapid-result test
administered to any person, which fee shall not exceed the reasonable cost to
the county board of health of administering and processing the test.  In the
case of tests provided to staff and residents of long-term care facilities with
100 or fewer authorized beds, the county board of health shall seek
reimbursement from the facility, and shall be prohibited from charging any fee
for the test to the staff member or resident.  The facility may seek
reimbursement for the cost of the test from a staff members or residents
health benefits plan; provided that in no case shall the facility charge a
staff member or resident for any portion of the cost of a rapid-result test
that is not covered by a health benefits plan, if the test was conducted
pursuant to subsection a. of this section.  For any test not conducted pursuant
to subsection a. of this section, the facility may seek reimbursement from the
staff member or resident in an amount equal to the actual cost of the test to
the facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Long-term care
facilities shall establish designated spaces for the isolation of residents who
have tested positive for the infectious disease or who were exposed to the
infectious disease, and shall take appropriate steps to ensure, to the extent
possible, that no more than one resident is housed in each residential room in
the facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    During an outbreak,

one or more long-term care facilities:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     (1)  Residents of a
long-term care facility may designate up to two individuals who shall be
authorized to engage in indoor visitation with the resident.  The designation
of authorized visitors pursuant to this paragraph shall remain in effect until
the outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic is no longer affecting or likely to affect
the long-term care facility, and a resident shall not be permitted to make any changes
to the individuals designated for visitation during this period except in the
event of the death of a designated individual.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   An individual designated
by a resident of a long-term care facility for indoor visitation with the
resident pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   be allowed to visit the
resident inside the long-term care facility once per day, at any time, day or

the facility;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   undergo a rapid-result
test for the infectious disease in connection with that individuals first
visit to the facility under this subsection.  Consistent with the requirements
of subsections b. and c. of section 2 of this act, the facility or the county
board of health, as applicable, may administer the test to the individual and
seek reimbursement from the individual for administration of the rapid-result
test, which reimbursement shall not exceed the actual cost of administering and
processing the test; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   for a second or
subsequent visit to the facility as authorized under this subsection, submit a
written attestation to the facility that, during the period between the
individuals last visit to the facility and the current visit, the individual
has adhered to guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the Department of Health, and the county or local board of health,
if any, with regard to infection control and prevention measures to prevent
transmission of the infectious disease, including, as applicable, maintaining
social distancing, wearing a face mask or facial covering while in public,
avoiding large group gatherings, avoiding contact with others while present in
indoor settings, and any other measures as may be in place; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)    be allowed to bring in
food and beverage items for exclusive consumption by the visitor and the
resident, which food and beverage items shall be screened by the facility and
may be excluded by the facility if the food or beverage item presents a risk of
transmitting an infectious disease or otherwise violates facility policies
concerning outside food and beverages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)    Long-term care
facilities shall limit in-person visitation as authorized under this subsection
to one visitor per resident at a time.  Visitation shall take place in the
residents room, if the resident does not have a roommate, or in a designated
visitation area, if the resident has one or more roommates.  Designated
visitation areas shall be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized after each use.  The
facility shall implement protocols and procedures to ensure that visitors to
the facility have as little contact as possible with staff and residents of the
facility, are kept away from common areas within the facility to the extent
possible, and do not touch any surfaces in the facility except as may be
otherwise unavoidable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   No visitation in a
long-term care facility shall be authorized pursuant to this subsection unless
the Department of Health has completed an in-person inspection of the facility
during the current outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic involving an infectious
disease, made a written determination that the facility is in compliance with
the requirements of this act and all applicable infection prevention and
control requirements as are currently applicable to the facility, and expressly
approves indoor visitation to take place at the facility consistent with the
requirements of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Residents of a long-term
care facility may designate a family member or other individual who shall be
authorized to approve the residents personal physician, or a care provider whose
services are paid for directly by the resident or the residents family, to
enter the facility for up to four hours per week to provide direct care
services to the resident, which direct care services may be provided over the
course of multiple visits within the week; provided that the physician or care
provider may request approval from the facility to provide more than four hours
of direct care services to the patient per week, which request shall be granted
if supported by medical need.  A physician or care provider who enters a
facility pursuant to this subsection shall not be considered to be employed by
or providing services at the long-term care facility for the purposes of
section 5 of this act.  The designated family member or other individual may,
but not need not, be an individual designated for visitation pursuant to
subsection a. of this section.</p>

designated by a resident of a long-term care facility for indoor visitation
with the resident pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section,
or who is a personal physician or care provider allowed access to the long-term
care facility pursuant to subsection b. of this section, shall be required to
comply with current guidance issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention or any other guidance required by the Department of Health
concerning infection prevention and control in long-term care facilities,
including any requirements concerning the use of personal protective
equipment.  Consistent with applicable guidance and current practices adopted
in response to the outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic, the facility may require
the individual to acquire the personal protective equipment at the individuals
own expense, prohibit the reuse of personal protective equipment, maintain a
supply of the personal protective equipment at the facility, and establish and
enforce requirements concerning proper doffing and disposal of the personal
protective equipment.</p>

one or more long-term care facilities:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Residents who travel
outside a long-term care facility for medical or non-medical reasons shall be
roomed in a separate area of the facility, and shall be subject to appropriate
procedures and protocols as are necessary to ensure that those residents are
isolated from, and do not have contact with, residents who do not travel
outside the facility.  The facility shall further establish separate rooming
areas and appropriate procedures and protocols to ensure that residents who
travel outside the facility only for medical reasons are isolated from, and do
not have contact with, residents who travel outside the facility for
non-medical reasons.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    All residents who travel
outside the facility for any reason shall be tested for the infectious disease
at least once per week, regardless of whether the resident exhibits any signs
or symptoms of having contracted the infectious disease.  The long-term care
facility and the resident shall split the costs of any portion of a test
required pursuant to this subsection that are not otherwise covered under the
residents health benefits plan.</p>

epidemic, or pandemic of an infectious disease affecting or likely to affect
one or more long-term care facilities:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     A person employed by or
providing services at a long-term care facility, other than a physician, may
only be employed by or provide services at that one facility, and shall be
prohibited from employment with, or providing professional services to, any
other entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  Any person employed
by or providing services at a long-term care facility who exhibits signs or
symptoms of the infectious disease shall be immediately removed from contact
with residents, tested for the infectious disease or referred for testing, and
prohibited from returning to the facility until the person provides the
facility with the results of two tests, administered three days apart,
establishing the person is negative for active infection with the infectious
disease.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Any person employed by
or providing services at a long-term care facility who tests positive for
active infection with the infectious disease shall be required to self-isolate
or quarantine at home until the persons symptoms resolve and the person
provides the facility with the results of two tests, administered three days
apart, establishing the person is negative for active infection with the
infectious disease; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed
to prohibit a person who tests positive for the infectious disease from seeking
treatment in a general acute care hospital or from another licensed health care
provider. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A long-term care
facility employing or utilizing the services of a person who is prohibited from
attending work under paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this
section shall pay the person the full wages the person would otherwise have
earned working at the facility during that period of time when the person is
prohibited from attending work.  If the person does not work a regular number
of hours at the facility, the wages due shall equal the wages due for the
average number of hours per week the person worked at the facility during the
preceding six months, or, if the person has worked at the facility for fewer
than six months, for the average number of weekly hours worked by the person
for the total time the person worked at the facility.  Wages provided to a

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, establishes certain
requirements concerning operational procedures and visitation at long-term care
facilities, which requirements would remain in effect for the duration of the
state of emergency and public health emergency declared in response to an
outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic involving an infectious disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
requires that all staff employed by or providing services at a long-term care
facility be tested for active infection with the infectious disease at least
once per week and immediately upon showing any signs or symptoms of having
contracted the infectious disease.  For facilities with more than 100
authorized beds, the test is to be made available on-site.  For facilities with
100 or fewer authorized beds, the test may be made available through the county
board of health.  County boards of health and facilities with more than 100
authorized beds will have seven days from the date a state of emergency or
public health emergency, if any, is declared in response to the outbreak,
epidemic, or pandemic, or as soon as rapid-result tests become available, to
acquire rapid-result testing materials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With regard to county boards
of health, in situations where the current or anticipated demand for
rapid-result testing resources through the county board of health exceeds the
current supply of test resources, the county board of health will be required
to give priority to testing staff and residents at facilities with 100 or fewer
authorized beds who currently exhibit signs or symptoms of the infectious
disease or have been recently exposed to the infectious disease, followed by
routine, weekly and medically-indicated testing of staff members of facilities
with 100 or fewer authorized beds, followed by first-time visitors to the
facility and members of the public, who would be tested on a first-come, first
served basis.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     County boards of health may
charge a reasonable fee for the administration of a rapid-result test, which
fee may not exceed the reasonable cost to the county board of health of
administering and processing the test.  In the case of tests provided to staff
and residents of long-term care facilities with 100 or fewer authorized beds,
the county board of health may only seek reimbursement from the facility, and
will be prohibited from charging any testing fee to the staff member or
resident.  The facility would be permitted to seek reimbursement from the staff
members or residents health benefits plan for the costs of the test, provided
that, in the case of weekly screening tests and tests for individuals showing
signs or symptoms of the infectious disease or who were exposed to the
infectious disease, the facility will be prohibited from charging staff or
residents for any portion of the cost of a test that is not covered under a
health benefits plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires long-term
care facilities to establish designated spaces for the isolation of residents
who have tested positive for the infectious disease or who were exposed to the
infectious disease, and further requires facilities to take appropriate steps
to ensure, to the extent possible, that no more than one resident is housed in
each residential room in the facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows long-term care
facility residents to designate up to two individuals who will be authorized to
engage in indoor visitation with the resident.  The designation will remain in
effect until the outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic is no longer affecting or
likely to affect the long-term care facility, a resident may not change the
designated visitors during this period except in the case of the death of a
designated visitor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Designated visitors will be
allowed to visit the resident inside the long-term care facility once per day,
at any time, day or night, for any duration of time, provided the individual
schedules a visitation appointment with the facility at least 24 hours in
advance.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Long-term care facilities are
to limit in-person visitation to one visitor per resident at a time. 
Visitation is to take place in the residents room, if the resident does not
have a roommate, or in a designated visitation area, if the resident has one or
more roommates.  Designated visitation areas are to be thoroughly cleaned and
sanitized after each use.  Facilities will be required to implement protocols
and procedures to ensure that visitors to the facility have as little contact
as possible with staff and residents of the facility, are kept away from common
areas within the facility to the extent possible, and do not touch any surfaces
in the facility except as may be otherwise unavoidable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All visitors will be screened
for the signs and symptoms of the infectious disease prior to being allowed
entry to the facility.  In addition, the first time a designated visitor visits
the facility, the visitor will be required to undergo a rapid-result test for
the infectious disease, which may be provided by the facility or by the county
board of health, depending on whether rapid-result tests for the disease are
made available through the facility.  The entity administering the test may
charge the visitor a reasonable reimbursement fee for the test, which fee may
not exceed the actual cost of administering and processing the test.  For a
second or subsequent visit to the facility, designated visitors will be
required to submit a written attestation to the facility that, during the
period between the individuals last visit to the facility and the current
visit, the individual adhered to guidance from the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the Department of Health, and the county or local board
of health as may apply with regard to infection prevention and control,
including, as applicable, maintaining social distancing, wearing a face mask or
facial covering while in public, avoiding large group gatherings, and avoiding
contact with others while present in indoor settings.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Designated visitors will be
allowed bring in food and beverage items for exclusive consumption by the
visitor and the resident, which food and beverage items will be screened by the
facility and may be excluded by the facility if the food or beverage item
presents a risk of transmitting the infectious disease or otherwise violates
facility policies concerning outside food and beverages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No visitation in a long-term
care facility will be allowed unless the Department of Health has completed an
in-person inspection of the facility during the current outbreak, epidemic, or
pandemic, made a written determination that the facility is in compliance with
the requirements of the bill and all applicable infection prevention and
control requirements as are currently applicable to the facility, and expressly
approves indoor visitation to take place at the facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, residents of a
long-term care facility may designate a family member or other individual who
may approve the residents personal physician or a care provider whose services
are paid for directly by the resident or the residents family, to enter the
facility for up to four hours per week to provide direct care services to the
resident, which care may be provided during multiple visits over the course of
the week.  The physician or care provider may request approval from the
facility to provide more than four hours of direct care services per week,
which request is to be granted based on demonstrated medical need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Designated visitors and
personal physicians and care providers accessing a facility will be required to
comply with current guidance issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention or any other guidance required by the Department of Health concerning
infection prevention and control in long-term care facilities, including any
requirements concerning the use of personal protective equipment.  Consistent
with applicable guidance and current practices adopted in response to the
outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic, the facility may require the individual to
acquire the personal protective equipment at the individuals own expense,
prohibit the reuse of personal protective equipment, maintain a supply of the
personal protective equipment at the facility, and establish and enforce
requirements concerning proper doffing and disposal of the personal protective
equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Residents who travel outside a
long-term care facility for medical or non-medical reasons are to be roomed in
a separate area of the facility and subject to appropriate procedures and
protocols to ensure that those residents are isolated from, and do not have
contact with, residents who do not travel outside the facility.  Facilities are
to further establish separate rooming areas and appropriate procedures and
protocols to ensure that residents who travel outside the facility only for
medical reasons are isolated from, and do not have contact with, residents who
travel outside the facility for non-medical reasons.  All residents who travel
outside the facility for any reason are to be tested for the infectious disease
at least once per week, regardless of whether the resident exhibits any signs
or symptoms of having contracted the infectious disease; the resident and the
facility will share the costs of any portion of this weekly test that is not
covered by the residents health benefits plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill additionally provides
that any person employed by or providing services at a long-term care facility,
other than a physician, may only be employed by or provide services at that one
facility, and will be prohibited from employment with or providing professional
services to any other entity.  This restriction will not apply to physicians
and care providers authorized to provide care to residents by an individual
designated by the resident as otherwise provided under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any person employed by or
providing services at a long-term care facility who exhibits signs or symptoms
of the infectious disease is to be immediately removed from patient contact,
tested for the infectious disease or referred for testing, and may not return
to the facility until the person provides the facility with the results of two
tests, administered three days apart, establishing the person is negative for
active infection with the infectious disease.  Any person employed by or
providing services at a long-term care facility who tests positive for active
infection with the infectious disease will be required to self-isolate or
quarantine at home until the persons symptoms resolve and the person provides
the facility with the results of two negative tests for active infection for
the infectious disease, which tests are to be administered three days apart. 
Nothing in the bill will prohibit a person who tests positive for an infectious
disease from seeking treatment in a general acute care hospital or from another
licensed health care provider. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A long-term care facility
employing or utilizing the services of a person who is prohibited from
attending work under the bill will be required to pay the person the full wages
the person would otherwise have earned working at the facility during the
period of mandatory exclusion.  If the person does not work a regular number of
hours at the facility, the wages due will equal the wages due for the average
number of hours per week the person typically works at the facility.</p>
