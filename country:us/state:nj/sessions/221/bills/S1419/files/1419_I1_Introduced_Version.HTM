construction structural inspector determines that the primary load bearing system
is not in conformance with the building plans, the applicant shall provide
additional plans which show conformance with a modification to the primary load
bearing system.  No certificate of occupancy shall be issued pursuant to
section 15 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-133), until the structural inspector
issues a written report which confirms that the construction of the primary

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, supplements the
State Uniform Construction Code Act (UCCA) to require that certain covered
buildings, which are limited to condominiums and cooperatives, and plans be
inspected and reviewed by a structural inspector, as defined in the bill,
during the buildings pre-construction, construction, and post-construction
phases.  In addition, this bill assures that planned real estate developments
have adequate reserve funds to make certain required maintenance repairs to
building components and common areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, this bill
supplements the UCCA to require that a structural inspector, designated by the
construction permit applicant or, in the absence of a designation, chosen by
the enforcing agency, review the construction plans submitted with a construction
application, set forth an inspection schedule to confirm that the primary load
bearing system conforms to the building plans, and issue a written report which
determines whether the primary load bearing system conforms to the building
plans.  A certificate of occupancy is not to be issued under this bill until
the structural inspectors report confirms that the construction of the primary
load bearing system of the building is in conformance with the approved
construction plans.  Further, a certificate of occupancy is not to be issued
under this bill if the construction permit applicant does not state at the time
of application, or prior to the first occupancy creating a condominium or
cooperative, that the building is to be a condominium of cooperative, until the
required inspections have occurred.  Similarly, this bill precludes the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy until any necessary repairs,
renovations, alterations, or modifications to the structural components of a
covered building are made pursuant to the inspectors report.  Under the bill,
certain timelines for inspections are dependent on when a certificate of
occupancy was issued.  Any additional cost to the enforcing agency incurred as
a result of inspections required under this bill are to be recovered through a
fee associated with the construction application. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, this bill
requires that a planned real estate development undertake a capital reserve
study to identify and assess the adequacy of the associations capital reserve
funds to meet the anticipated costs associated with maintaining the structural
integrity of the buildings that the association is obligated to maintain.  This
capital reserve study is to be conducted by a credentialed reserve specialist,
or licensed engineer or architect, and is to include an analysis of certain
provisions enumerated in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, this bill
requires that a planned real estate development create and fund a plan to
ensure that adequate reserve funds are available to repair or replace one or
more components of common elements and facilities that the association is
obligated to maintain without need to create a special assessment or loan
obligation.  The bill also allows an planned real estate developments
executive board to adopt an assessment payable by the owners over one or more
fiscal years, or obtain a loan on terms as the board determines to be
reasonable, when necessary to fund the cost of corrective maintenance of the
primary load bearing system of the planned real estate development.  Prior to
adopting the assessment, the board is to be required to obtain a written report
from a licensed engineer or architect explaining that the failure to undertake
corrective maintenance of the primary load bearing system would produce certain
results enumerated in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that the
developer of a planned real estate development prepare a document setting forth
a schedule for the preventative maintenance tasks to be undertaken by the
association over the life of the common area components, including, but not
limited to, periodic inspections of the structural components of the buildings
or common areas that the association is obligated to maintain.  This document
is also to be made available to prospective purchasers or owners of units,
parcels, or other interests of the planned real estate development.  This
preventative maintenance document is to also be updated pursuant to the
specifications of any structural inspections or reports performed under the
UCCA.</p>
