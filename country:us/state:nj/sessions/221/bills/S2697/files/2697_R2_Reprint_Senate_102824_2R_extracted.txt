In addition to the flashing devices permitted in subsection a. of this section, an omnibus may be equipped with two flashing devices for the purpose of warning the operators of other vehicles and law enforcement officials that an emergency situation exists within the omnibus. These devices shall be capable of activation by the operator of the omnibus and shall be of a type approved by the [Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles] Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission.

(cf: P.L.1985, c.536, s.1) 2. R.S.39:3-50 is amended to read as follows: 39:3-50.

(b)   Lamps and reflectors on projecting loads shall emit or reflect light with color as provided in section 10 of 1[this act] P.L.1964, c.136 (C.39:3-61.4)1. (c)   No person shall drive or move any vehicle or equipment upon any street or highway equipped with any device or lamp thereon capable of or displaying a light of any other color than permitted by this section, except: an authorized emergency vehicle, an authorized school bus, [or] a vehicle authorized by a permit issued by the chief administrator, or a vehicle authorized to display green lights pursuant to subsection c. of R.S.39:3-54.

The fees collected pursuant to this section shall be considered revenue of the commission and shall not be subject to the calculation of proportional revenue remitted to the commission pursuant to section 105 of P.L.2003, c.13 (C.39:2A-36). The chief administrator may cancel or revoke a permit issued under authority of this section whenever the conditions for its issuance no longer exist or on any other reasonable grounds.
