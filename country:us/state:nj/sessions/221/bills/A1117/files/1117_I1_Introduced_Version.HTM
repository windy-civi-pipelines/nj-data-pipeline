<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='font-family:"Times",serif;
letter-spacing:0pt'>1.    R.S.43:21-19 is amended to read as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43:21-19.  Definitions.  As
used in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1&nbsp;et&nbsp;seq.),&nbsp;unless the context
clearly requires otherwise:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  (1)  &quot;Annual
payroll&quot; means the total amount of wages paid during a calendar year
(regardless of when earned) by an employer for employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   &quot;Average annual
payroll&quot; means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer for the
last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher,
except that any year or years throughout which an employer has had no
&quot;annual payroll&quot; because of military service shall be deleted from
the reckoning; the &quot;average annual payroll&quot; in such case is to be
determined on the basis of the prior three or five calendar years in each of
which the employer had an &quot;annual payroll&quot; in the operation of his
business, if the employer resumes his business within 12 months after
separation, discharge or release from such service, under conditions other than
dishonorable, and makes application to have his &quot;average annual
payroll&quot; determined on the basis of such deletion within 12 months after
he resumes his business; provided, however, that &quot;average annual
payroll&quot; solely for the purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (e) of
R.S.43:21-7 means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer on which
he paid contributions to the State disability benefits fund for the last three
or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher; provided further
that only those wages be included on which employer contributions have been
paid on or before January 31 (or the next succeeding day if such January 31 is
a Saturday or Sunday) immediately preceding the beginning of the 12-month
period for which the employer's contribution rate is computed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   &quot;Benefits&quot;
means the money payments payable to an individual, as provided in this chapter
(R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), with respect to his unemployment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)  (1)  &quot;Base
year&quot; with respect to benefit years commencing on or after July 1, 1986,
shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters
immediately preceding an individual's benefit year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With respect to a benefit year
commencing on or after July 1, 1995, if an individual does not have sufficient
qualifying weeks or wages in his base year to qualify for benefits, the
individual shall have the option of designating that his base year shall be the
&quot;alternative base year,&quot; which means the last four completed calendar
quarters immediately preceding the individual's benefit year; except that, with
respect to a benefit year commencing on or after October 1, 1995, if the
individual also does not have sufficient qualifying weeks or wages in the last
four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding his benefit year to
qualify for benefits, &quot;alternative base year&quot; means the last three
completed calendar quarters immediately preceding his benefit year and, of the
calendar quarter in which the benefit year commences, the portion of the
quarter which occurs before the commencing of the benefit year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The division shall inform the
individual of his options under this section as amended by P.L.1995, c.234.  If
information regarding weeks and wages for the calendar quarter or quarters
immediately preceding the benefit year is not available to the division from
the regular quarterly reports of wage information and the division is not able
to obtain the information using other means pursuant to State or federal law,
the division may base the determination of eligibility for benefits on the
affidavit of an individual with respect to weeks and wages for that calendar
quarter.  The individual shall furnish payroll documentation, if available, in
support of the affidavit.  A determination of benefits based on an alternative
base year shall be adjusted when the quarterly report of wage information from
the employer is received if that information causes a change in the
determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   With respect to a
benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who immediately
preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable under the
provisions of the &quot;Temporary Disability Benefits Law,&quot; P.L.1948,
c.110 (C.43:21-25 et seq.), &quot;base year&quot; shall mean the first four of
the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the
individual's period of disability, if the employment held by the individual
immediately preceding the period of disability is no longer available at the
conclusion of that period and the individual files a valid claim for unemployment
benefits after the conclusion of that period. For the purposes of this
paragraph, &quot;period of disability&quot; means the period defined as a
period of disability by section 3 of the &quot;Temporary Disability Benefits
Law,&quot; P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27).  An individual who files a claim under
the provisions of this paragraph (2) shall not be regarded as having left work
voluntarily for the purposes of subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   With respect to a
benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who
immediately preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable
under the provisions of the workers' compensation law (chapter 15 of Title 34
of the Revised Statutes), &quot;base year&quot; shall mean the first four of
the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the
individual's period of disability, if the period of disability was not longer
than two years, if the employment held by the individual immediately preceding
the period of disability is no longer available at the conclusion of that
period and if the individual files a valid claim for unemployment benefits
after the conclusion of that period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, &quot;period
of disability&quot; means the period from the time at which the individual
becomes unable to work because of the compensable disability until the time

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises the test
used to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor
under certain State labor laws. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The ABC test is widely used
under current State labor law for determining whether a worker is an employee
or an independent contractor.  It is used to determine employee and employer
obligations and entitlements under the following laws: the unemployment
compensation law, the Temporary Disability Benefits Law, the New Jersey wage
payment law, and the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law.  It is also used
under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, for purposes of determining
whether an employer is required to deduct and withhold State income taxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The ABC test provides that
an individual who performs services for remuneration is presumed to be an
employee unless the employer can show to the satisfaction of the Department of
Labor and Workforce Development that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (A)  Such individual has been
and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of
such service, both under his contract of service and in fact; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B)  Such service is either
outside the usual course of the business for which such service is performed,
or that such service is performed outside of all the places of business of the
enterprise for which such service is performed; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (C)  Such individual is
customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation,
profession or business.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If an employer fails to prove
any one of the three criteria for showing a worker is an independent
contractor, the worker will be classified as an employee, and will be eligible
for benefits pursuant to the labor laws listed above. Additionally, the
employer and employee will be required to comply with the contribution and participation
obligations of the respective labor laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill eliminates the B and
C factors of the employment status test, thereby limiting the test to factor A,
whether the individual has been and will continue to be free from control of
the employer.  By limiting the factors used in the employment status test to
the control test, it will be easier for employers to comply with regulations
and categorize workers for purposes of State labor laws.  </p>
