(cf: P.L.2018, c.126, s.9) 6.    (New section)  a.  The board shall issue a limited cosmetic retail service license to a cosmetic retail service establishment provided that the premises shall: (1)   comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et seq.); (2)   display a permanent sign indicating the name of the cosmetic retail services establishment, which shall be clearly visible to the general public from the exterior of the shop; (3)   have a minimum of 750 square feet of floor space; (4)   have one lavatory including a toilet, hand washing facilities, and a door; (5)   have one sink basin with hot and cold running water; (6)   have a designated area for cleaning and disinfecting implements and tools; (7) have one ultrasonic unit for cleaning metal implements and tools; (8) have a clean, closed receptacle for storage of sanitized implements and tools at each work station; (9)   have a closed container for clean linens; (10) have a closed container for soiled linens; (11) have a closed waste container accessible to each work station; and (12) have a dispensary or place where supplies are prepared and dispensed. b.    A cosmetic retail service establishment licensed by the board pursuant to this section shall be permitted to have one workstation with a chair for the performance of cosmetic retail services for every 750 square feet of retail space the establishment occupies.  Not more than one workstation within the premises shall be equipped to perform massaging, cleansing, or stimulating the face or neck by mechanical or electrical appliances. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends current law to establish licensure requirements for limited cosmetic retail service licenses to be issued to cosmetic retail service establishments.  The license will allow qualifying establishments to offer certain skin care services, defined in the bill as cosmetic retail services, which include the services allowed by law to be performed by a licensed skin care specialist. At present, a cosmetics retailer is prohibited from offering any paid services unless it separates from the floor space of a retail facility at least 350 square feet of space for two customer chairs and an additional 50 square feet of space for each additional chair.  These are the same requirements for full service salons.  Under the bill, a limited cosmetic retail service establishment will be allowed to consider the entire square footage of the store for the purpose of licensure and will be allowed one chair for every 750 square feet of retail space. The beauty and cosmetics industry employs a large number of New Jersey residents and is critical to the success of retail facilities within the State, such as shopping malls and retail centers.  This bill will create new jobs for persons already licensed as skincare specialists, allow those graduating from an approved cosmetology school to have more options for employment, and grow the retail-based economy of New Jersey.

(cf: P.L.2018, c.126, s.9) 6.    (New section)  a.  The board shall issue a limited cosmetic retail service license to a cosmetic retail service establishment provided that the premises shall: (1)   comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et seq.); (2)   display a permanent sign indicating the name of the cosmetic retail services establishment, which shall be clearly visible to the general public from the exterior of the shop; (3)   have a minimum of 750 square feet of floor space; (4)   have one lavatory including a toilet, hand washing facilities, and a door; (5)   have one sink basin with hot and cold running water; (6)   have a designated area for cleaning and disinfecting implements and tools; (7) have one ultrasonic unit for cleaning metal implements and tools; (8) have a clean, closed receptacle for storage of sanitized implements and tools at each work station; (9)   have a closed container for clean linens; (10) have a closed container for soiled linens; (11) have a closed waste container accessible to each work station; and (12) have a dispensary or place where supplies are prepared and dispensed. b.    A cosmetic retail service establishment licensed by the board pursuant to this section shall be permitted to have one workstation with a chair for the performance of cosmetic retail services for every 750 square feet of retail space the establishment occupies.  Not more than one workstation within the premises shall be equipped to perform massaging, cleansing, or stimulating the face or neck by mechanical or electrical appliances. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends current law to establish licensure requirements for limited cosmetic retail service licenses to be issued to cosmetic retail service establishments.  The license will allow qualifying establishments to offer certain skin care services, defined in the bill as cosmetic retail services, which include the services allowed by law to be performed by a licensed skin care specialist. At present, a cosmetics retailer is prohibited from offering any paid services unless it separates from the floor space of a retail facility at least 350 square feet of space for two customer chairs and an additional 50 square feet of space for each additional chair.  These are the same requirements for full service salons.  Under the bill, a limited cosmetic retail service establishment will be allowed to consider the entire square footage of the store for the purpose of licensure and will be allowed one chair for every 750 square feet of retail space. The beauty and cosmetics industry employs a large number of New Jersey residents and is critical to the success of retail facilities within the State, such as shopping malls and retail centers.  This bill will create new jobs for persons already licensed as skincare specialists, allow those graduating from an approved cosmetology school to have more options for employment, and grow the retail-based economy of New Jersey.
