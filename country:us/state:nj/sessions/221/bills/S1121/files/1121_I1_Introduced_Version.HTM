promoting the more effective operation of local government and the sharing of

  Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.2007,
c.63 (C.40A:65-2) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Historically, many
specialized statutes have been enacted to permit shared services between local
units for particular purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    <u>(1)</u>   Other laws,
permitting a variety of shared services, including interlocal services
agreements, joint meetings, and consolidated and regional services<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>,<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> exist but
have not been very effective in promoting the broad use of shared services as a
technique to reduce local expenses funded by property taxpayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(2)   The goal of
encouraging and facilitating the provision of local and regional services
through a shared service agreement, joint contract, or consolidation that
results in a cost savings that may be passed along to property taxpayers over
time, is an important goal of the State of New Jersey, and delays caused by
disputes over Civil Service rules and tenure provisions resulting from a shared
service, joint contract, or consolidation must be resolved expeditiously to
ensure that such provisions do not hinder that goal.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     It is appropriate for
the Legislature to enact a new shared services statute that can be used to
effectuate agreements between local units for any service or circumstance
intended to reduce property taxes through the reduction of local expenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    It is contrary to public
policy that the tenure rights of certain local personnel should effectively
prohibit shared services agreements for the services provided by those local
personnel, thereby depriving property taxpayers of property tax relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In order to evaluate
the efficiencies related to the sharing of services of certain local personnel
having tenure rights in office, it is appropriate to create a pilot program in
seven counties of the State which embody urban, suburban, and rural
characteristics to study the sharing of the services of these personnel between
municipalities by allowing for the dismissal of such a tenured local official,
as necessary, in order to promote and effectuate the sharing of a service. </p>

Civil Service, then the agreement shall include an employment reconciliation
plan in accordance with this section that shall specifically set forth the
intended jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission.  <u>Unless otherwise
agreed to by the parties, the local unit that will be providing the service
will be responsible for filing the employment reconciliation plan with the
Civil Service Commission.</u>  An employment reconciliation plan shall be subject

time, the results of the economic analysis shall be submitted to the affected
municipalities and other public entities. No recommendation for a shared
service that is submitted to the State Treasurer by the commission shall be made
unless the commission finds that the current level of service will be
maintained or improved for each affected municipality and that each affected
municipality will realize a cost savings.  The State Treasurer shall, within 90
days of receipt, weigh any contrary information or evidence submitted by
affected municipalities and other public entities and then either certify the
recommendation, or prepare a memo of objections for the commission.  The local
unit shall, within 30 days from the date that the commission submits the
economic analysis, either certify the recommendation or provide, either
electronically, by e-mail, by letter, or by personal delivery, a written
objection along with supporting documentation to the State Treasurer.  The
commission shall work with the State Treasurer in satisfying the objections

Commission, P.L.2007, c.54 (C.52:27D-501 et seq.) to encourage and facilitate
the provision of local and regional services through shared service agreements
and joint meeting contracts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends and
supplements the &quot;Uniform Shared Services and Consolidation Act&quot; to
expedite the resolution of disputes over Civil Service rules and tenure
provisions, which are reportedly responsible for delaying the implementation of
shared service agreements and joint contracts.  The bill also makes a number of
changes that affect employees of local units that enter into either a shared
service agreement or a joint meeting.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Most notably, local units would
no longer be required to provide employees terminated for reasons of economy
and efficiency with a terminal leave payment; the Civil Service Commission
would no longer be required to review employment reconciliation plans; and
certain provisions of Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes,
could be relaxed by the Civil Service Commission upon request by the parties to
the agreement.  The local unit providing the service would have to decide which
employees would transfer from a recipient local unit, subject to the provisions
of any existing collective bargaining agreements within the affected local
units.  To that end, the bill would repeal certain provisions of the &quot;Uniform
Shared Services and Consolidation Act&quot; that preserve the tenure rights of
police officers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the Local
Unit Alignment, Reorganization and Consolidation Commission (LUARCC) examines
the consolidation of municipalities, the merger of autonomous agencies into their
parent municipal or county government, and the sharing of services between
municipalities or between municipalities and other public entities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill clarifies LUARCCs
powers to recommend the consolidation or merger of specific municipalities and
autonomous agencies and the sharing of services between municipalities or
between municipalities and other public entities.  When considering a possible
recommendation for consolidation or the sharing of services, the bill requires
LUARCC to conduct at least five on-site consultation sessions in each local
unit being studied, with the governing bodies, or their designees, and affected
officials and other public entities under consideration for consolidation or
the sharing of services. LUARCC would be required to include in every
consolidation and shared services proposal an estimate of the savings that
would result from the implementation of its recommendations.  Once LUARCC
recommends a sharing of services, it must hold a series of public hearings in
each affected municipality.  The State Treasurer would be required to certify
LUARCCs basis for its fiscal analysis before LUARCC could submit a
recommendation to a municipality.  The municipality would then have the right
to appeal LUARCCs estimate of savings resulting from a recommendation to the
Commissioner of Community Affairs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
LUARCC consolidation recommendation would not be binding on a municipality and
there would be no penalty for failing to implement the consolidation.  However,
the bill requires a municipality to approve a LUARCC recommendation for the
sharing of services within 14 months of the recommendation, and implement the
proposal within 28 months.  A municipality could approve the recommendation by
adoption of a resolution or ordinance or by adoption by the voters of the local
unit.  The bill allows a municipality to adopt a resolution or ordinance
approving the recommendation subject to voter approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a municipality does not
approve a LUARCC recommendation for the sharing of services, or does not make a
good faith attempt to implement the recommendation within the required
timeframes, it would be subject to a loss of State aid equal to LUARCCs
estimated cost savings for implementing the recommendation.  A municipality would
not be subject to a reduction in State aid if it approved a recommendation for
the sharing of services and the failure to implement the recommendation was due
to the action or inaction of the governing body or voters of another local unit.
