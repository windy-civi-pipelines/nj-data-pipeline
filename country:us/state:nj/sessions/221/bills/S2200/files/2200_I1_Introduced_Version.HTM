<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  For privilege
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024 but before January 1, 2029, a
commercial farm operator that makes a donation of fruits or vegetables fit for
human consumption to a charitable organization located in this State shall be
allowed credit against the corporation business tax imposed pursuant to section
5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), in an amount equal to 10 percent of the
wholesale value of the fruits or vegetables that are donated to the<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'> </span></b>charitable
organization during the privilege period of donation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In order to claim the
credit allowed pursuant to this section, a commercial farm operator shall obtain
a written statement from the charitable organization substantiating each
donation of fruits or vegetables made during the privilege period for which the
credit is allowed.  At the time a donation is made, the commercial farm
operator shall provide to the charitable organization the wholesale value of
the donated fruits or vegetables and information identifying the location where
the fruits or vegetables were grown.  The charitable organization, upon receipt
of the donated fruits or vegetables, shall issue to the commercial farm
operator making the donation a written statement, signed and dated by an
individual authorized to accept the donation on behalf of the charitable
organization, that contains the variety, grade, and quantity of the donated
fruits or vegetables, the name and address of the commercial farm operator
making the donation, the name and address of the charitable organization, and,
as provided by the commercial farm operator, the wholesale value of and the
location where the donated fruits or vegetables were grown.  When filing a
return that includes a claim for the credit allowed pursuant to this section,
the commercial farm operator shall include a copy of each written statement
issued to the commercial farm operator by a charitable organization during the
privilege period for which the credit is allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The order of priority
of the application of the credit allowed pursuant to this section and any other
credits allowed by law shall be as prescribed by the director. The amount of
the credit applied under this section against the corporation business tax
liability of the taxpayer for a privilege period, together with any other
credits allowed by law, shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax liability
otherwise due and shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the
statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162
(C.54:10A-5).  The amount of the credit allowable under this section which
cannot be used to reduce the taxpayers corporation business tax liability for
the privilege period due to the limitations of this section may be carried
forward and applied to the earliest available use within the five privilege
periods immediately following the privilege period for which the credit is
allowed. The wholesale value of any donated fruits or vegetables that are
included in the calculation of the credit allowed pursuant to this section
shall not be allowed as an amount calculated or claimed pursuant to any other
deduction or credit allowed under the corporation business tax.</p>

</p>

includes any organization that is incorporated under the provisions of Title 15
or Title 16 of the Revised Statutes or Title 15A of the New Jersey Statutes,
any organization that is exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code, any entity to which a charitable contribution as defined
under subsection (c) of section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code is deductible
under section 170, and any food bank as defined in section 2 of P.L.1982, c.178
(C.24:4A-2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commercial farm means
commercial farm as that term is defined by section 3 of P.L.1983, c.31
(C.4:1C-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commercial farm operator
means the taxpayer primarily responsible for the on-site, day-to-day operation
of a commercial farm, at which farm fruits or vegetables are planted, managed,
and harvested for donation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Wholesale value means: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     the value calculated by using
a quantity-weighted average wholesale sales price of the donated fruits or vegetables
as determined based on the wholesale sales price paid for each wholesale sale
of fruits or vegetables made by the commercial farm operator during the
calendar month of the commercial farm operators donation that are the same
variety and grade as the donated fruits or vegetables and the respective
weight, volume, or other standard unit of measure of each wholesale sale; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     if no wholesale sales of
fruits or vegetables that are the same variety and grade as the donated fruits
and vegetables are made by the commercial farm operator during the calendar
month of the commercial farm operators donation, the wholesale value shall be
equal to the overall average price paid for fruits or vegetables that are the
same variety and grade as the donated fruits or vegetables at the nearest
terminal market located the fewest miles from the commercial farm operators
commercial farm during the calendar month of the commercial farm operators
donation as determined using the Fruit and Vegetable Market News Custom Average
Tool maintained by the United States Department of Agricultures Agricultural
Marketing Service, or another similar source of average price data as may be
prescribed by the director.</p>

credit is allowed.  At the time a donation is made, the commercial farm
operator shall provide to the charitable organization the wholesale value of
the donated fruits or vegetables and information identifying the location where
the fruits or vegetables were grown.  The charitable organization, upon receipt
of the donated fruits or vegetables, shall issue to the commercial farm

allowed by law, shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax liability otherwise due.
The amount of the credit allowable under this section which cannot be used to
reduce the taxpayers gross income tax liability for the taxable year due to
the limitations of this section may be carried forward and applied to the earliest
available use within the five taxable years immediately following the taxable
year for which the credit is allowed. The wholesale value of any donated fruits
