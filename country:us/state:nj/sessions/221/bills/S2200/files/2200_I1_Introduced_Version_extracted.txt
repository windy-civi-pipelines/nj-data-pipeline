Under the bill, a commercial farm operator would be required to obtain a written statement from the charitable organization before claiming the tax credit.  In addition to certain other information, this statement would specify the variety, grade, and quantity of the donated fruits and vegetables and the wholesale value of the fruits and vegetables, as provided by the commercial farm operator.  The bill would require a commercial farm operator to include a copy of each statement issued by a charitable organization when filing a tax return that claims the credit. The bill would also require the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to prepare an annual report on the utilization of the credits provided by the bill.  Under the bill, the director would be required to prepare this report by December 1, 2025, and on or before that same date in each of the following four years.  However, if the director fails to prepare the annual report before the required date of completion, the director would be required to testify before the Senate Economic Growth Committee, the Assembly Agriculture and Food Security Committee, or any other legislative committee determined by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the General Assembly, to explain the delay.
