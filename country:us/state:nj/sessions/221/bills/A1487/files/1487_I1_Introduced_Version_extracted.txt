STATEMENT This bill would require the Board of Public Utilities (board) to establish and implement a program to provide rebates to certain residents of the State for the purchase of eligible low-speed electric bicycles.  The purpose of the rebate program is to reduce emissions from motor vehicles by encouraging the purchase and use of low-speed electric bicycles in urban areas for short distance trips.  Rebates may be made available only to residents in the State of municipalities with a population over 70,000 in an amount up to $2,000 but may not exceed the purchase price of the eligible low-speed electric bicycle.

The bill appropriates $250,000 from the General Fund to the Board of Public Utilities for the purposes of providing rebates pursuant to the program established in the bill.
