An Act establishing a five-year grant program for the care of retired Standardbred and Thoroughbred horses and making an appropriation. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: The horse racing industry is economically important to this State, and the general welfare of the people of the State will be promoted by the advancement of horse racing and related projects and facilities in the State.

The horse racing industry generates millions of dollars in tax revenue each year for the State, employs thousands of workers, and operates three historical racetracks. The horses that run in these races are the backbone of the horse racing industry and the main reason hundreds of thousands of fans come out to support the racetracks each year. While the horse racing industry and respective associations do support their retired horses through various programs, including charity racing days, more can be done. The racehorses that drive these profits and benefits to the State deserve to be cared for in their retirement. The care for retired horses is an important matter of public policy and, therefore, it is appropriate for the State to establish a grant program for the purpose of supporting certain organizations that care for retired horses. 2.  a.  The New Jersey Racing Commission shall establish a five-year grant program for the purpose of providing funds to assist with the care of retired horses.  In establishing the five-year program, the commission shall develop an application by which accredited organizations may apply for grants pursuant to this section and develop the criteria the commission will utilize to award the grants. b.
