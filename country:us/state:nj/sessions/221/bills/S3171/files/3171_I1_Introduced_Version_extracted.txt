Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  a.  For the purposes of this section: Guest means the same as the term is defined pursuant to N.J.S.2A:44-47 Minor child means a child under the age of 18 years but excludes a child residing in a placement funded or approved by the Division of Child Protection and Permanency in the Department of Children and Families pursuant to either a voluntary placement agreement or court order. Minor ward means a minor child for whom a guardian is appointed. b.  For the purposes of determining whether a property owner shall be required to comply with the residential eviction process, and the restrictions on the removal of a tenant established pursuant to the Anti-Eviction Act, P.L.1974, c.49 (C.2A:18-61.1 et seq.), in order to remove a guest of a hotel or motel, the factors provided in this section shall be considered.  Only if the following factors are generally accurate, shall the guest of a hotel or motel be considered a tenant, not a transient guest: (1)  the guests stay has lasted for three months or longer; (2)  the guest has demonstrated an intent to stay for a long period of time through actions that may include, but shall not be limited to, registering to vote or sending the guests children or minor ward to a public school, or both, or using the address of the hotel or motel for the receipt of mail or commercial courier deliveries; (3)  the operator of the hotel or motel had reason to know that the guest intended to be a long-term guest; (4)  the hotel or motel is the guests only place of residence; (5)  the majority of other guests of the hotel or motel are long-term guests, and consider the hotel or motel as their primary residence; (6)  the living space of the guest contains a stove, oven, and refrigerator; and (7)  the guest has used personal linens, and has done their own housekeeping. 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes a distinction between residential tenants and transient guests of a hotel or motel for the purpose of determining permitted removal actions.  The bill codifies a multi-factor test, reflecting the existing test established by New Jersey courts, to apply in distinguishing between a tenant and a transient guest. Specifically, in order to remove a guest of a hotel or motel and determine whether a property owner is required to comply with the residential eviction process, and the restrictions on tenant removal established by the Anti-Eviction Act, N.J.S.A.2A:18-61.1 et seq., the bill requires seven factors to be considered.  If the following factors are generally accurate, then the guest of a hotel or motel would be considered a tenant, not a transient guest: · the guests stay has lasted for three months or longer; · the guest has demonstrated an intent to stay for a long period of time through actions that may include registering to vote or sending children to a public school, using the address of the hotel or motel for the receipt of mail or deliveries; · the hotel or motel operator had reason to know that the resident intended to be a long-term guest; · the hotel or motel is the guests only place of residence; · the majority of other guests are long-term guests, and consider the hotel or motel as their primary residence; · the living space of the guest contains a stove, oven, and refrigerator; and · the guest has used personal linens, and has done their own housekeeping. The bill would take effect immediately.
