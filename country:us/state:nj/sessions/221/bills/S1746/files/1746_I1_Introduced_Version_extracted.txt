The bill also provides that, in a bankruptcy case, the owners exemptions shall be determined on the date the bankruptcy petition is filed or, with respect to property respect to property that becomes property of the estate after that date, the date the property becomes property of the estate.  If the value of the owner's interest in homestead property on such date is less than or equal to the amount that can be exempted under the homestead law, then the owner's entire interest in the property, including the owner's right to possession and interests of no monetary value, is exempt.  Any appreciation in the value of the owner's exempt interest in the property during the bankruptcy case is also exempt, even if it exceeds the statutory limit. The bill additionally increases the total value of household goods that are exempt from debt collection, from $1,000 to $15,000, and provides for an exemption from garnishment of up to $10,000 for cash held in a deposit account or other account of the debtor, or up to $15,000 if the cash amount is held in a joint account.
