<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. Section 4 of P.L.2018, c.6 (C.19:31-6.14)
is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4. a. Any State agency, except
for the Motor Vehicle Commission, that the Secretary of State verifies already
collects documents that would provide proof of eligibility, including age,
citizenship, and residence address, may establish and implement, upon approval
by the Secretary of State, a procedure for automatically and electronically
transmitting voter registration information to the Secretary of State of
persons who are eligible to vote for the purpose of registering such persons to
vote or updating their voter registration. Each person from whom such
information is collected shall be offered an opportunity to decline automatic
voter registration <u>as provided under section 3 of P.L.   , c.   (C.   )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill)</u>. Any such agency shall comply
with the requirements, to the extent applicable as determined by the Secretary
of State, as established in subsections b. through d. of section 24 of
P.L.1994, c.182 (C.39:2-3.2).</p>

with all applicable federal laws and regulations, the Division of Medical
Assistance and Health Services in the Department of Human Services shall
automatically and electronically transmit voter registration information to the
Secretary of State for each person who applies to the New Jersey Medical
Assistance and Health Services Program, who is of sufficient age to register to
vote, and who is externally verified as a United States citizen as part of an
application to that division. In processing information received from that division,
the Secretary of State and each county commissioner of registration shall
comply with the requirements, to the extent applicable as determined by the
Secretary of State, as established in section 24 of P.L.1994, c.182
(C.39:2-3.2).</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>c.</u> Any additional
agencies that are designated for automatic voter registration shall comply with
the requirements, to the extent applicable as determined by the Secretary of
State, as established in section 24 of P.L.1994, c.182 (C.39:2-3.2) for
automatic voter registration and shall provide the notices required pursuant to
subsection c. thereof to each person from whom such information is collected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2018, c.6, s.4)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2. Section 24 of P.L.1994,
c.182 (C.39:2-3.2) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     24. a. The Secretary of State,
with the assistance of the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle
Commission, shall provide for an eligible applicant to simultaneously apply for
a motor vehicle driver's license, an examination permit, a probationary
driver's license, or a non-driver identification card, as applicable, and be
automatically registered to vote, or have an existing voter registration
updated, in a manner which satisfies both the requirements necessary to receive
a license to operate a motor vehicle, pursuant to R.S.39:3-10, or an
examination permit, a probationary driver's license, or a non-driver
identification card, as applicable, and to register to vote, pursuant to
R.S.19:4-1.  The applicant shall be offered an opportunity to decline the
automatic voter registration under this section<u>, in the manner provided under
section 3 of P.L.   , c.   (C.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this
bill)</u>.  If an applicant changes the applicant's party affiliation when
updating an existing voter registration under this section, the applicant shall
be sent a confirmation notice by the county commissioner of registration noting
that change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) Pursuant to subsection
a. of this section, for every application for a motor vehicle driver's license,
an examination permit, a probationary driver's license, or a non-driver
identification card, and each related update, renewal, or change of address,
except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, the Chief
Administrator shall ensure that the information necessary for voter
registration is collected from the application and promptly transmitted
electronically to the Secretary of State.  The Chief Administrator shall ensure
that electronic records are not transmitted to the Secretary of State for any
applicant who has declined registration.  The Commissioner of Registration
shall register to vote or update an existing registration for any eligible
applicant who has not declined voter registration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Voter registration
information from an application received online for the renewal of a motor
vehicle driver's license or non-driver identification card shall be collected
and promptly transmitted electronically to the Secretary of State upon the
implementation by the Secretary of State of online voter registration. 
Subsection c. of this section shall be inapplicable to such applications until
that time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) Voter registration
information from an application received through the mail for the renewal of a
motor vehicle driver's license or non-driver identification card shall be
exempt from collection and electronic transmission to the Secretary of State
until such time as the Chief Administrator determines that the prompt electronic
transmission of the information is practicable.  Subsection c. of this section
shall be inapplicable to such applications until that time.  Following the
effective date of P.L.2018, c.6, the Chief Administrator shall inform the
Governor and the Legislature every six months of the practicability of
collecting and transmitting to the Secretary of State voter registration
information from such applications.  This paragraph shall not be construed to
preclude the Motor Vehicle Commission from processing voter registration
applications received in the manner in which such applications were processed
in connection with such renewals prior to the effective date of P.L.2018, c.6.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c. The Chief Administrator
shall provide for the following notices to be provided with every application
for a motor vehicle driver's license, an examination permit, a probationary
driver's license, or a non-driver identification card and every related update,
renewal, or change of address:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) a notice that the
applicant will be registered to vote, if eligible, unless the applicant
specifically declines the automatic voter registration <u>in the manner
provided under section 3 of P.L.   , c.   (C.   ) (pending before the

applicant shall be promptly reported to the Secretary of State.  A change of
address notification received by the Chief Administrator in paper format shall
be reported to the Secretary of State no later than the 10th day following its
receipt by the Chief Administrator.  The Commissioner of Registration shall use
the change of address notification to update an existing voter registration
unless the applicant declines the automatic voter registration pursuant to this
section and indicates that the change of address is not for voter registration
purposes.  A change of address notification submitted to the commission, which
is used for voter registration purposes, shall be subject to the provisions of
section 1 of P.L.1994, c.148 (C.19:31-3.2) if the person submitting the change

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3. (New section) a. Upon
receiving completed automatic voter registration forms electronically from the
New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission pursuant to section 24 of P.L.1994, c.182
(C.39:2-3.2), or from the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in
the Department of Human Services or another State agency pursuant to section 4
of P.L.2018, c.6 (C.19:31-6.14), the Secretary of State shall electronically
transmit the forms to the respective county commissioners of registration, who
shall determine whether each person whose name appears on a form meets the
qualifications of a voter under R.S.19:4-1. The county commissioners of
registration shall notify each qualified person whose name appears on a form of
the automatic voter registration process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. If a county commissioner of
registration determines that the person whose name appears on the completed
automatic voter registration form does not meet the qualifications of a voter
under R.S.19:4-1, the county commissioner of registration shall notify the
person of the determination in writing, at the address included in the form,
unless that person has already declined to register to vote.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c. Each county commissioner of
registration shall notify each person registered to vote under subsection a. of
this section, in writing, at the address included in the form, of the persons
opportunity to: (1) decline to register to vote; or (2) adopt a political party
affiliation. Such notification shall be provided to the person by mail, in
English and Spanish, and any additional languages to be determined by the
Secretary of State. If a person so notified does not decline to register to
vote within 21 calendar days after the issuance of the notification, the county
commissioner of registration shall add the persons name and all pertinent
information to the Statewide Voter Registration System.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d. The county commissioners of

name of a person who indicates in writing that the person does not wish to be registered
to vote.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e. If the information transmitted
on the automatic voter registration form is for a person whose name is already
included in the Statewide Voter Registration System, and if the information
indicates a subsequent change to the persons name or address, the county
commissioner of registration shall update the voters record accordingly. For a
change of address to a new county of residence, the county commissioner of
registration shall electronically notify, in a form approved by the Secretary
of State, the county commissioner of registration of the county where the
person was last registered as a voter, who shall remove the persons name from
the list of active registered voters in that county.</p>

obtained pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h. If a person who is not
entitled to vote becomes registered to vote pursuant to this section, that
person's registration shall be presumed to have been effected with official

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill expands the automatic
voter registration process to Medicaid applicants and provides for each person
who automatically registers to vote in this State to decline such automatic
voter registration in the days following receipt of a voter registration notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, persons who
meet the qualifications to become registered voters may automatically register
to vote during a transaction at the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, such
as while applying for a motor vehicle drivers license, an examination permit,
a probationary drivers license, or a non-driver identification card. Current
law also allows any State agency to implement a similar automatic voter
registration process, if the Secretary of State verifies that the agency collects
the necessary documentation for automatic voter registration. Under current
law, the applicant must be given the opportunity to decline automatic voter
registration. The opportunity to decline is offered during the applicants interaction
with the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission or State agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require the
Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in the Department of Human
Services to implement an automatic voter registration process. Under the bill,
the division would transmit voter registration information to the Secretary of
State for each person who applies to the New Jersey Medical Assistance and
Health Services Program, subject to compliance with all applicable federal laws
and regulations. The bill would therefor expand automatic voter registration to
the population of Medicaid applicants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, this bill
requires for the opportunity to decline automatic voter registration to be
offered to the applicant in the days after the persons interaction with the
New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission or State agency, rather than during such
interaction. Under the bill, each county commissioner of registration would be
required to notify each person registered to vote, in writing, at the address
included in the completed automatic voter registration form, of the persons
opportunity to: (1) decline to register to vote; or (2) adopt a political party
affiliation. Such notification would be provided to the person by mail, in
English and Spanish, and any additional languages to be determined by the
Secretary of State. If a person so notified does not decline to register to
vote within 21 calendar days after the issuance of the notification, the county
commissioner of registration would add the persons name and all pertinent
information to the Statewide Voter Registration System.</p>
