(2)  The annual appropriations act for each State fiscal year commencing with fiscal year 2023 shall appropriate and distribute to each municipality an amount not less than (a) the sum of Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid and Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid paid to that municipality in fiscal year 2012 and (b) the amount distributed to each municipality pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection e. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.167 (C.52:27D-439). b.    If the provisions of subsection a. of this section are not met on the effective date of an annual appropriations act for the State fiscal year, or if an amendment or supplement to an annual appropriations act for the State fiscal year should violate the provisions of subsection a. of this section, the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury shall, not later than five days after the enactment of the annual appropriations act, or an amendment or supplement thereto, that violates the provisions of subsection a. of this section, certify to the Director of the Division of Taxation that the requirements of subsection a. of this section have not been met. c.    The Director of the Division of Taxation shall, no later than five days after certification by the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury pursuant to subsection b. of this section that the provisions of subsection a. of this section have not been met or have been violated by an amendment or supplement to the annual appropriations act, notify all taxpayers that have filed a return under the Corporation Business Tax (1946), P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) during the previous calendar year, other than taxpayers that are gas, electric, and gas and electric, or telecommunications public utilities as defined pursuant to subsection (q) of section 4 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-4) pursuant to the amendment to that section 4 made in section 2 of P.L.1997, c.162, that the taxpayer shall have no liability pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1945, c.162 for any corporation business tax for the taxpayer's current privilege period, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary. (cf: P.L.1997, c.167, s.4) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the distribution of additional State aid to municipalities under the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Act.  Budget constraints required reductions in the amount of Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid (CMPTRA) distributed to all municipalities in Fiscal Years 2009, 2010, and 2011.  Some municipalities also experienced reductions in their Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid (ETR Aid) distribution during that period.  This supplemental funding would restore, over a two-year period, approximately $331 million in reductions to CMPTRA and ETR Aid. In Fiscal Year 2023, municipalities would receive an aid increase equal to 50 percent of the difference between the distribution of CMPTRA and ETR Aid they received in Fiscal Year 2008 and Fiscal Year 2012.  The fully restored amount would be distributed beginning in Fiscal Year 2024 and in each fiscal year thereafter. The total amount of aid to be restored to each municipality would be in addition to the total amount of CMPTRA and ETR Aid distributed to each municipality in Fiscal Year 2012.  This legislation also extends the existing ETR Aid poison pill protection to ensure that each municipality received an aid amount not less than the combined payment of CMPTRA and ETR Aid to municipalities in Fiscal Year 2012 and the additional aid distributed under the bill. This bill also amends current law to require a municipality to subtract any additional amount of ETR aid it receives, pursuant to the bill, from its adjusted tax levy when computing that amount for its next fiscal year.  By deducting the additional amount of ETR Aid from the previous years levy, municipalities would be permitted to raise a lower amount of taxes through the levy for municipal purposes.  The bill prohibits a municipality from anticipating, for purposes of preparing its annual budget, the receipt of any State aid payment from the ETR aid under the provisions in the bill.  The bill also requires a municipality to amend its local budget to properly reflect the total amount distributed to the municipality from the ETR aid.

(cf: P.L.1997, c.167, s.4) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the distribution of additional State aid to municipalities under the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Act.  Budget constraints required reductions in the amount of Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid (CMPTRA) distributed to all municipalities in Fiscal Years 2009, 2010, and 2011.  Some municipalities also experienced reductions in their Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid (ETR Aid) distribution during that period.  This supplemental funding would restore, over a two-year period, approximately $331 million in reductions to CMPTRA and ETR Aid. In Fiscal Year 2023, municipalities would receive an aid increase equal to 50 percent of the difference between the distribution of CMPTRA and ETR Aid they received in Fiscal Year 2008 and Fiscal Year 2012.  The fully restored amount would be distributed beginning in Fiscal Year 2024 and in each fiscal year thereafter. The total amount of aid to be restored to each municipality would be in addition to the total amount of CMPTRA and ETR Aid distributed to each municipality in Fiscal Year 2012.  This legislation also extends the existing ETR Aid poison pill protection to ensure that each municipality received an aid amount not less than the combined payment of CMPTRA and ETR Aid to municipalities in Fiscal Year 2012 and the additional aid distributed under the bill. This bill also amends current law to require a municipality to subtract any additional amount of ETR aid it receives, pursuant to the bill, from its adjusted tax levy when computing that amount for its next fiscal year.  By deducting the additional amount of ETR Aid from the previous years levy, municipalities would be permitted to raise a lower amount of taxes through the levy for municipal purposes.  The bill prohibits a municipality from anticipating, for purposes of preparing its annual budget, the receipt of any State aid payment from the ETR aid under the provisions in the bill.  The bill also requires a municipality to amend its local budget to properly reflect the total amount distributed to the municipality from the ETR aid.
