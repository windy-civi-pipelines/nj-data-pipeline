<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act:</p>

reimbursement under the program.</p>

underserved area&quot; means a geographic area designated in this State by the
Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the New Jersey Horse Council,
the New Jersey Association of Equine Practitioners, the New Jersey Veterinary

a list of State designated veterinary underserved areas and transmit the list
of State designated veterinary underserved areas to the authority by January 1
of each year, except that the first list shall be transmitted not later than 90

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. Nothing in this section
shall prohibit a program participant from initiating the programs application
process and identifying and committing to employment at an approved site prior
to the establishment of State residency or being issued a State veterinary
license. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a program participant, who
otherwise meets the eligibility requirements enumerated in subsection a. of
this section, from initiating the programs application process if the
applicant sufficiently demonstrates that the applicant intends to establish a
veterinary practice that will qualify as an approved site. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.  In administering the

of a loan under the loan redemption program shall be 100 percent of the
eligible qualifying loan expenses for full-time service for five years of
service, except that the amount of qualifying loans which may be redeemed for a
participant under the program shall not exceed $30,000 in any year.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a
Veterinary Medicine Loan Redemption Program to address the current large animal
veterinarian shortage in this State.  The program will be administered by the
Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
provides for redemption of eligible qualifying loan expenses for veterinarians
who work for no less than five years at an approved site.  An approved site is
a site located within a State designated veterinary underserved area or within
five miles of a State designated veterinary underserved area.  The bill defines
a State designated veterinary underserved area as a geographic area designated
in this State by the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the New
Jersey Horse Council, the New Jersey Association of Equine Practitioners, the
New Jersey Veterinary Medical Association, and the New Jersey Farm Bureau, on
the basis of a large animal veterinarian shortage affecting the area.  The
secretary is required to annually establish a list of State designated
veterinary underserved areas and transmit that list to HESAA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Program participants are
required to be State residents and be a veterinarian licensed, or eligible to
be licensed, to practice in this State, agree to practice at an approved site,
and agree that the practice is full-time and that at least 75 percent of the
participants work is dedicated to large animal veterinary care.  In return for
this commitment, the program participants eligible qualifying loan expenses
will be reimbursed.  Maximum loan redemption under the bill will equal 100
percent of the eligible qualifying loan expenses for full-time service in
return for five years of service, except that the amount of qualifying loans
which may be redeemed for a participant under the program is not to exceed
$30,000 in any year.  Under the bill, no amount of loan redemption is to be
provided for service performed by a program participant that is less than full-time
and for service in which less than 75 percent of the participants work at an
approved site is dedicated to large animal veterinary care.  No amount of
eligible qualifying loan expenses is to be redeemed for services performed for
less than a full year.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that in the
case of a program participant's death or total and permanent disability, HESAA
will nullify the service obligation of the program participant.  The
nullification will also terminate HESAA's obligations under the loan redemption
contract. In the event of a program participant's death or total and permanent
disability, HESAA will not require repayment of the prior redeemed portion of
indebtedness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that
$500,000 will be annually appropriated from the General Fund to HESAA for the
Veterinary Medicine Loan Redemption Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Since New Jersey currently
does not have its own veterinary medicine school, the provisions of this bill
are intended to establish a cost-effective path to addressing the large animal
veterinarian shortage by incentivizing veterinary school graduates to reside in
the State and practice in areas of the State experiencing large animal
veterinarian shortages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     From 1990 to 2007, the State
provided for a contract program with veterinary schools in other states to
buy seats reserved exclusively for New Jersey students.  This program allowed
New Jersey residents vying for seats at out-of-State veterinary schools to only
compete against each other for those seats, not the entire population of
applicants at large.  The program also provided funding that permitted those
students to attend the out-of-State veterinary schools at in-State tuition
rates.  However, this program resulted in residents leaving the State for
veterinary school, with no promise that they would return to practice in New
Jersey.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Several other states have
implemented veterinary loan redemption programs similar to the program
established by this bill, including Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Texas, and Wyoming.  The program established by this
bill will incentivize residents of this State, who attend out-of-State
veterinary schools, to return to New Jersey to perform services in a veterinary
practice that is dedicated to large animal veterinary care, in exchange for a
redemption of their veterinary school loans over a relatively short period of
time.  This program will provide enormous benefits for large animal owners
living in areas of this State with a shortage of adequate veterinary medicine
services.  Additionally, this program will not penalize program participants
with respect to tax liability.  Under current federal and State law, amounts of
student loan redemption, loan forgiveness, or loan cancellation are not
considered income for purposes of taxation.</p>
