<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.39:3-10 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     39:3-10. a. A person shall not
drive a motor vehicle on a public highway in this State unless the person is
under supervision while participating in a behind-the-wheel driving course
pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1977, c.25 (C.39:3-13.2a) or is in possession of a
validated permit, or a probationary or basic driver's license issued to that
person in accordance with this article.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A person under 18 years of
age shall not be issued a basic license to drive motor vehicles, and a person
shall not be issued a validated permit, including a validated examination
permit, until the applicant has passed a satisfactory examination and other
requirements as to the applicant's ability as an operator.  The examination
shall include: a test of the applicant's vision; the applicant's ability to
understand traffic control devices; the applicant's knowledge of safe driving
practices, including the dangers of driving a vehicle in an aggressive manner,
which shall include, but not be limited to, unexpectedly altering the speed of
a vehicle, making improper or erratic traffic lane changes, disregarding
traffic control devices, failing to yield the right of way, and following another
vehicle too closely; the applicant's knowledge of operating a motor vehicle in
a manner that safely shares the roadway with pedestrians, cyclists, skaters,
riders of motorized-scooters, and other non-motorized vehicles, which shall
include, but not be limited to, passing a cyclist on the roadway, recognizing
bicycle lanes, navigating intersections with pedestrians and cyclists, and
exiting a vehicle without endangering pedestrians and cyclists; the applicant's
knowledge of the effects that ingestion of alcohol or drugs has on a person's
ability to operate a motor vehicle; the applicant's knowledge of the dangers of
carbon monoxide poisoning from motor vehicles and techniques for the safe
operation and proper maintenance of a motor vehicle; the applicant's knowledge
of portions of the mechanism of motor vehicles as is necessary to insure the
safe operation of a vehicle of the kind or kinds indicated by the applicant;
and the applicant's knowledge of the laws and ordinary usages of the road.  The
examination shall be made available in English and each of the three languages,
other than English, most commonly spoken in the State, as determined by the
chief administrator.  The chief administrator shall periodically, and at least
every five years, verify the three languages, other than English, most commonly
spoken in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A person shall not sit
for an examination for any permit without exhibiting photo identification
deemed acceptable by the commission, unless that person is a high school
student participating in a course of automobile driving education approved by
the State Department of Education and conducted in a public, parochial, or
private school of this State, pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1950, c.127
(C.39:3-13.1). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Prior to taking an examination
for  any permit, a person shall watch a video created by the commission, in
conjunction with the Attorney General, explaining the rights and
responsibilities of a driver stopped by a law enforcement officer.  The video
shall be used for informational purposes only and shall not be used in any
criminal proceeding involving a driver stopped by a law enforcement officer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission may waive the
written law knowledge examination for any person 18 years of age or older
possessing a valid driver's license issued by any other state, the District of
Columbia, or the United States Territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern
Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands.  The commission shall be
required to provide that person with a booklet that highlights those motor
vehicle laws unique to New Jersey.  A road test shall be required for a
probationary license and serve as a demonstration of the applicant's ability to
operate a vehicle of the class designated.  During the road test, an applicant
may use a rear visibility system, parking sensors, or other technology
installed on the motor vehicle that enables the applicant to view areas
directly behind the vehicle or alerts the applicant of obstacles while parking.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A person shall not sit
for a road test unless that person exhibits photo identification deemed
acceptable by the commission.  A high school student who has completed a course
of behind-the-wheel automobile driving education approved by the State
Department of Education and conducted in a public, parochial, or private school
of this State, who has been issued a special learner's permit pursuant to
section 1 of P.L.1950, c.127 (C.39:3-13.1) prior to January 1, 2003, shall not
be required to exhibit photo identification in order to sit for a road test. 
The commission may waive the road test for any person 18 years of age or older
possessing a valid driver's license issued by any other state, the District of
Columbia, or the United States Territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern
Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands.  The road test shall be
given on public streets, where practicable and feasible, but may be preceded by
an off-street screening process to assess basic skills.  The commission shall
approve locations for the road test which pose no more than a minimal risk of
injury to the applicant, the examiner, and other motorists.  New locations for
the road test shall not be approved unless the test can be given on public
streets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     A person who
successfully completes a road test for a motorcycle license or a motorcycle
endorsement when operating a motorcycle or motorized scooter with an engine
displacement of less than 231 cubic centimeters shall be issued a motorcycle
license or endorsement restricting the person's operation of the vehicles to
any motorcycle with an engine displacement of 500 cubic centimeters or less.  A
person who successfully completes a road test for a motorcycle license or
motorcycle endorsement when operating a motorcycle with an engine displacement
of 231 or more cubic centimeters shall be issued a motorcycle license or
endorsement without any restriction as to engine displacement.  Any person who
successfully completes an approved motorcycle safety education course
established pursuant to the provisions of section 1 of P.L.1991, c.452
(C.27:5F-36) shall be issued a motorcycle license or endorsement without
restriction as to engine displacement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A person issued a
motorcycle license pursuant to this section may be issued a standard motorcycle
license or a REAL ID motorcycle license. The chief administrator shall require
an applicant for a standard motorcycle license to provide as proof of the
applicant's identity, age, and residence primary and secondary documents, with
which the chief administrator shall attribute point values in accordance with
the point based identification verification program established pursuant to
