<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>establishing a period equity and menstrual
disorders study and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  The Legislature finds and
declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  Period inequity is an
umbrella term that encompasses several issues including unequal access to
feminine hygiene products, education, reproductive care, as well as the stigma
surrounding menstruating and the toxic ingredients used in pads and tampons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Period inequity is
attributable to the high cost of feminine hygiene products and the fact that
the prices of these products are the same for people who menstruate, regardless
of socioeconomic status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  People who menstruate
typically have menstrual cycles every 28 days.  On average, a menstrual cycle
can last between five and seven days, requiring the purchase of multiple
feminine hygiene products for each menstrual cycle.  The combination of these
factors can lead to astronomical, recurring costs during a persons
menstruating years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  Those who cannot afford
feminine hygiene products often try to extend the life of products by using
them for multiple hours at a time.  This can lead to a myriad of health
problems, including placing a person who menstruates at a greater risk for
toxic shock syndrome, a life-threatening infection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  Twenty-seven states have a
luxury tax on menstrual products, bringing in roughly $88 million dollars on
products that are necessities for a large segment of the population.  Items
like condoms and Viagra, however, are considered health products and are not
taxed.  In addition, feminine hygiene products cannot be purchased with food
stamps or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, placing
low income people at a disadvantage when buying such products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  While financial barriers
are an issue impacting period inequity, stigma itself is also a significant
barrier to improving access to feminine hygiene products and education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  The stigma and shame
surrounding menstruation makes it difficult to not only normalize menstruation
in conversation, especially for transgendered and non-binary people who
menstruate, but also to create and advance policy change such as eliminating
the tax on, and regulating ingredients used in, feminine hygiene products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  For those who can afford
feminine hygiene products, most pads and tampons are made with materials
containing dioxins, toxins, phthalates, fragrances, and pesticides. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.  The United States Food and
Drug Administration does not require feminine hygiene product companies to test
for chemicals, and if they do, they are not required to disclose the presence
of harmful toxins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.  There has been very little
research conducted on the long term effects of using feminine hygiene products,
and only relatively recent research has been conducted on this subject in
general. As a result, those who use feminine hygiene products may be unaware of
the consequences of using these products on a long-term basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.  Period inequity is not the
only problem facing persons who menstruate.  Menstrual disorders are
complications that affect a woman's normal menstrual cycle.  Abnormal
menstruation can be linked to various biological, psychological, or
environmental factors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.  Common menstrual
disorders, from heavy bleeding and skipped periods, to troublesome mood swings,
disrupt the lives of persons who menstruate in crucial ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.  Reproductive health has
been hampered by a lack of understanding of basic uterine and menstrual
physiology, and enhancing the understanding of the underlying phenomena
involved in menstruation, abnormal uterine bleeding, toxic shock syndrome, and
other menstruation-related disorders can increase the quality of, and improve
access to, reproductive health care. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.  The high cost of feminine
hygiene products, the lack of education on how the menstrual cycle works, not
knowing how to use or properly dispose of feminine hygiene products, and the
lack of public awareness about menstrual disorders, all can lead to economic
hardship and health care disparities for minorities, persons with disabilities,
the transgendered community, and other under-served populations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     o.  The State of New Jersey has
exempted feminine hygiene products, such as pads and tampons, from the sales tax. 
In doing so, the State has recognized that it is financially burdensome for
persons who menstruate to continue to purchase these products at unaffordable
prices.  However, more can be done to achieve period equity for all of New
Jerseys citizens who menstruate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     p.  It is in the best interest
of the State to establish a committee to study issues relating to period
inequity, menstrual disorders, and the impact both have on the health of
persons who menstruate.  The establishment of such a committee is necessary for
the State to: achieve period equity and ensure that all who menstruate,
regardless of socio-economic background, have access to affordable and safe
feminine hygiene products, education, and reproductive care without shame or
stigma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Menstrual disorders mean
conditions that involve physiological and emotional symptoms centering around
menstruation, typically prior to or during the period cycle, including, but not
limited to, heavy bleeding, amenorrhea, premenstrual dysphoric disorder,
premenstrual syndrome, fibroids, endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and
oligomenorrhea. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Toxic shock syndrome means

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a 15-member
Period Equity and Menstrual Disorders Committee.  Specifically, the committee
is to study issues relating to period inequity, access to feminine hygiene
products, menstrual disorders, and the health of persons who menstruate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The committee is to consist
of: (1) three members of the General Assembly, appointed by the Speaker of the
General Assembly, and three members of the Senate, appointed by the Senate
President, each representing the Legislative Black Caucus, the Legislative
Latino Caucus, and the Legislative Disability Caucus, respectively; (2) representatives
of the New Jersey Council on Developmental Disabilities and the New Jersey
Supreme Court Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Community Engagement; and
the President of the New Jersey Obstetrical and Gynecological Society, or a
designee; and (3) six members of the public, appointed by the Governor, with
demonstrated knowledge of, or experience with, period inequity, menstrual
disorders, and issues relating to the health of persons who menstruate who
represent communities and community-based advocacy groups reflecting the
diverse economic, racial, cultural, gender, and occupational composition of the
State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the provisions of the
bill, the committee is to: (1) examine current data, research, and policies
related to the pricing and taxation of feminine hygiene products and racial,
gender, and disability disparities within the State, and their impact on the
affordability of, and access to, feminine hygiene products for persons who
menstruate, specifically those in the minority, disability, and transgendered
and non-binary communities, and other under-served populations; (2) establish
ways to raise awareness and educate the public about menstrual disorders, and
to better provide care and services to those who suffer from these disorders;
(3) establish guidelines and best practices for educating persons who
menstruate about toxic shock syndrome; (4) study the impact that period
inequity, the lack of reproductive care, the stigma surrounding menstruating,
and menstrual disorders have on the health of persons who menstruate; (5)
develop strategies to make feminine hygiene products more affordable and
accessible in the communities and populations specified in the bill; and (6)
outline policies and procedures that should be implemented to achieve period
equity in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines: menstrual
disorders as conditions that involve physiological and emotional symptoms
centering around menstruation, typically prior to or during the period cycle,
including, but not limited to, heavy bleeding, amenorrhea, premenstrual
dysphoric disorder, premenstrual syndrome, fibroids, endometriosis,
dysmenorrhea, and oligomenorrhea; and toxic shock syndrome as an acute
disease, caused by the staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, or
clostridium sordellii bacteria, which occurs in persons using tampons, and is
characterized by fever, diarrhea, nausea, diffuse erythema, and shock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within one year after
organization, and on an annual basis, the committee is to prepare and submit a
report to the Governor and the Legislature that includes its findings and makes
recommendations for legislative or administrative action necessary to further
the purposes of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Period inequity is an umbrella
term that encompasses several issues including unequal access to feminine
hygiene products, education, reproductive care, as well as the stigma
surrounding menstruating and the toxic ingredients used in pads and tampons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Period inequity is
attributable to the high cost of feminine hygiene products and the fact that
the prices of these products are the same for people who menstruate, regardless
of socioeconomic status.  Those who cannot afford feminine hygiene products
often suffer from a myriad of health problems, including placing a person who
menstruates at a greater risk for toxic shock syndrome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     While financial barriers are
an issue impacting period inequity, stigma and the lack of knowledge of what
the long-term use of feminine hygiene products can do to the health of persons
who menstruate, are also significant barriers to improving access to feminine
hygiene products and education.  These barriers make it difficult to normalize
menstruation in conversation, especially for transgendered and non-binary
people who menstruate, and to create and advance policy change such as
eliminating the tax on, and regulating ingredients used in, feminine hygiene
products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Period inequity is not the
only issue facing persons who menstruate.  Menstrual disorders are
complications that affect a woman's normal menstrual cycle and often disrupt
the lives of persons who menstruate in crucial ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The high cost of feminine
hygiene products, the lack of education on how the menstrual cycle works, not
knowing how to use or properly dispose of feminine hygiene products, and the
lack of public awareness about menstrual disorders, all can lead to economic
hardship and health care disparities for minorities, persons with disabilities,
the transgendered and non-binary communities, and other under-served
populations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     While the State has taken
steps to address period inequity by exempting feminine hygiene products, such
as pads and tampons, from the sales tax, more can be done to achieve period
equity for all of New Jerseys citizens who menstruate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Therefore, it is in the best
interest of the State to establish a committee to study issues relating to
period inequity, menstrual disorders, and the impact both have on the health of
persons who menstruate in order for the State to achieve period equity and
ensure that all who menstruate, regardless of socio-economic background, have
access to affordable and safe feminine hygiene products, education, and
reproductive care without shame or stigma.</p>
