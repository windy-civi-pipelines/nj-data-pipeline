In addition, the bill would prohibit the use of silver flags to mark anything likely to be confused with a pesticide application.  The exclusive color requirement is intended to distinguish pesticide flags from, among other things, those used for invisible dog fences, underground utility lines, septic tanks, and underground piping. The bill also directs the Department of Environmental Protection to promulgate rules and regulations effectuating these requirements.
