c.162.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.   The gross income of
an eligible taxpayer for a taxable year shall not include an amount of up to
$2,500 of employer contributions to a lifelong learning account of the eligible
taxpayer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Gross income shall not
include earnings that accrue on the balance of a lifelong learning account to
the eligible taxpayer for the taxable year, except as provided in subsection c.
of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)     Gross income of
a taxpayer shall include qualified and nonqualified distributions from a
lifelong learning account of the taxpayer for the taxable year of
distribution.  Provided further, the exclusions allowed pursuant to N.J.S.54A:6-10
and N.J.S.54A:6-15 shall not apply to any distributions from a lifelong
learning account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Notwithstanding
paragraph (1) of this subsection, gross income of an eligible taxpayer for a
taxable year shall not include: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   a distribution of
contributions for the taxable year made in excess of the annual $2,500 limit
for lifelong learning account contributions, provided that the earnings thereto
are also distributed and reported as gross income, or  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   a distribution from the
lifelong learning account of a taxpayer that is contributed to a lifelong
learning account of the taxpayer within 60 days of distribution, provided that
this subparagraph shall not apply to a distribution occurring within 365 days
of a prior distribution which was excluded from gross income pursuant to this
subparagraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    If a taxpayer makes a
nonqualified distribution from the taxpayers lifelong learning account the
taxpayer shall be subject to a penalty in the form of additional tax liability
due pursuant to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1, for the
taxable year of the distribution.  The amount of the additional tax liability
shall be five percent of the amount of the nonqualified distribution.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This subsection shall not
apply to nonqualified distributions incident to death, disability, divorce,
separation pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by
subsection (p) of section 414 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(26&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;s.414),&nbsp;or a taxpayer who has attained the age of 71
as of the first day of the taxable year. Excluded employer contributions shall
be allocated to the distribution on a pro rata basis between the amount of the
distribution and the amount remaining in the account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     As used in this
section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Disability means becoming
disabled and being unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by
reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be
expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Eligible taxpayer means a
taxpayer that as of the first day of the taxable year has attained the age of
18 but not yet attained the age of 71 and is the beneficiary for whom the
lifelong learning account has been established.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lifelong learning account means
an account created or organized, for the exclusive benefit of the taxpayer, in New
  Jersey as a lifelong learning account, which designation means that the
account is to be used exclusively for the purpose of making qualified
distributions.  To qualify as a lifelong learning account the account shall be
administered in adherence to the following requirements: all contributions
shall be made in an amount of money; all contributions to lifelong learning
accounts of a taxpayer for a taxable year shall not exceed $2,500, except as to
contributions which are made from funds distributed from a lifelong learning
account of the taxpayer within 60 days of the contribution, provided that the
distribution is not occurring within 365 days of a prior distribution excluded
from gross income pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of subsection
c. of this section; the trustee of the lifelong learning account shall be a
bank or other entity that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that
the lifelong learning account shall be administered in adherence to the
requirements of this section; an eligible taxpayers interest in the account balance
is nonforfeitable; the trustee of the lifelong learning account shall not
invest the accounts assets in life insurance contracts or collectibles, as
that term is defined pursuant to subsection (m) of section 408 of the federal
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.408); lifelong learning account
assets shall not be commingled with other property except in a common trust
fund or common investment fund; and requirements that the director deems to be
necessary to implement 
P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill), which the director shall adopt by
regulation in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968,
c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nonqualified distribution means
a distribution from a lifelong learning account that is not used for qualified
education expenses. A nonqualified distribution shall not include a
distribution of contributions for the taxable year made in excess of the annual
$2,500 limit for lifelong learning account contributions, provided that the
earnings thereto are also distributed and reported as gross income. A
nonqualified distribution shall not include a distribution from the lifelong
learning account of a taxpayer that is contributed to a lifelong learning
account of the taxpayer within 60 days of distribution, provided that the
distribution is not occurring within 365 days of a prior distribution excluded
from gross income pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of subsection
c. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualified distribution means
a distribution from a lifelong learning account that is used for qualified
education expenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualified education expense

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes certain tax
exclusions and credits for the use of lifelong learning accounts (account) in
order to finance worker training and education.  Generally, the bill consists
of four parts: gross income tax (GIT) exclusions for employer-provided account
contributions and account earnings; a GIT credit for personal account
contributions; GIT and corporation business tax (CBT) credits for employers
making account contributions for their employees; and administrative provisions
concerning the maintenance of the accounts.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows a taxpayer to
exclude from taxable gross income, employer contributions to the taxpayers
account of up to $2,500 per year and earnings on account balances.  Generally,
distributions from an account are treated as taxable income under the GIT,
except in the case of certain account rollovers and account adjustments made
due to excess contributions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides a GIT credit
for a taxpayers own contributions to the taxpayers account.  Generally, the
credit is for 50 percent of a taxpayers first $500 of account contributions,
or $1,000 for taxpayers filing jointly, and 25 percent for the taxpayers
account contributions exceeding $500, or $1,000 for taxpayers filing jointly. 
The maximum creditable contribution amount varies based on the taxpayers
filing status and annual income level. Generally, individual filers are allowed
a maximum creditable contribution of $2,500, which is reduced by $1 for each $8
earned over $100,000.  Creditable contributions are not allowed for individual
filers with $120,000 of annual income or more. Generally, joint filers are
allowed a maximum creditable contribution of $5,000 in the case of married
individuals each of whom contributes to a lifelong learning account, which is
reduced by $1 for each $8 earned over $200,000.  Creditable contributions are
not allowed for joint filers with $240,000 of annual income or more. Maximum
creditable contributions are reduced by the amount of any employer-provided
account contributions, which are excluded from the taxpayers taxable income by
this bill.  Generally, the maximum credit amount is $750 for individuals and
$1,500 for joint filers. Depending upon a taxpayers liability and order of
application of other potential credits, the GIT credit for taxpayer account
contributions is refundable.  The bill grants the Director of the Division of
Taxation the authority to preclude rollovers between accounts from qualifying
for credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows GIT and CBT
credits for employers making account contributions for their employees in an
amount equal to 25 percent of account contributions.  Per employee and per tax
year, annual account contributions may not exceed $2,500.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Small business employers are allowed
an additional credit amount for 50 percent of the administrative costs
associated with the credit for the tax year, but not exceeding $500 of credit
for the tax year.  The bill defines a small business as a taxpayer with no more
than 100 employees, each with no less than $5,000 of annual compensation. The
small business administrative cost credit is allowed only for the first and
second tax years for which the employer is allowed the employer-provided
employee account contribution credit. Both the employer-provided employee
account contribution credit and the small business administrative cost credit
are nonrefundable, but the amount of an unused credit may be carried forward
one tax year and used as a deduction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes certain
requirements for the maintenance and use of the accounts.  Accounts must be
created or organized in New Jersey and for the exclusive benefit of the account
beneficiary.  For a tax year, total contributions, from whatever source, to
lifelong learning accounts of a taxpayer may not exceed $2,500, except as to
account rollovers.  Account trustees must be a bank or other entity that
demonstrates to the Director of the Division of Taxation that accounts will be
maintained in accordance with the bill.  An account beneficiarys interest in
the account balance is nonforfeitable. The bill prohibits a trustee from
investing account assets in life insurance contracts or collectibles and
prohibits account assets from being commingled with other property, except as
to common trust or investment funds.  The bill gives the Director of the
Division of Taxation rulemaking authority with regard to further account
requirements.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Generally, the bill restricts
qualified use of accounts to taxpayers that are 18 to 70 years of age.  Account
funds are to be distributed for qualified education expenses incurred by the
taxpayer or the taxpayers spouse.  Qualified education expenses are amounts
paid and required for instructional courses, training courses, and
apprenticeship programs, which include, but are not limited to, books,
equipment, fees, information technology devices, supplies, tools, and tuition. 
Qualified education expenses do not include amounts paid for courses or
programs taken for recreational or leisure purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill includes a penalty
for nonqualified distributions in the form of additional tax liability in the
amount of five percent of the nonqualified distribution.  The bills
nonqualified distribution penalty does not apply to distributions on account of
death, disability, divorce, or attaining the age of 71 as of the first day of
the taxable year. The bill also contains exemptions from the nonqualified
distribution penalties for distributions that are rollovers between accounts
and account adjustments made due to excess annual account contributions. </p>
