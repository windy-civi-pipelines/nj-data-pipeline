(cf: P.L.2006, c.56, s.1) 7. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the provisions found in several of the theft statutes concerning the aggregation of the value of stolen property. Current law allows the value of stolen property to be aggregated so that a higher degree of crime can be charged if the property being aggregated was stolen pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.  The bill clarifies that one scheme or course of conduct can be carried out across multiple criminal episodes or transactions, against the same or several victims, or across a single county or multiple counties. Under the bill, evidence that multiple episodes or transactions constitute one scheme or course of conduct may include, but is not limited to, evidence that the acts involve the same defendant or defendants, are substantially similar in nature, and occur within a two-year period. Under the consolidated theft statute, N.J.S.A.2C:20-2, theft is a crime of the second degree if the amount involved is $75,000 or more.  Theft is a crime of the third degree if the amount is more than $500 but less than $75,000.  Theft is a crime of the fourth degree if the amount is between $200 and $500.  Theft is a disorderly persons offense if the amount is less than $200.  These same monetary amounts also apply when grading the level of offense for receiving stolen property, fencing stolen property, and shoplifting.  Concerning motor vehicle theft and receiving stolen motor vehicles, these are crimes of the second degree if the value of the vehicle is $75,000 or more; otherwise they are crimes of the third degree. A crime of the second degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of five to ten years, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.  A crime of the third degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of three to five years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  A disorderly persons offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.

(cf: P.L.2023, c.101, s.4) 2. N.J.S.2C:20-7 is amended to read as follows: 2C:20-7. Receiving Stolen Property. a.     Receiving. A person is guilty of theft if he knowingly receives or brings into this State movable property, other than a motor vehicle, of another knowing that it has been stolen, or believing that it is probably stolen.  It is an affirmative defense that the property was received with purpose to restore it to the owner. Receiving means acquiring possession, control or title, or lending on the security of the property. b.    Permissive inference. The requisite knowledge or belief may be inferred in the case of a person who: (1) Is found in possession or control of two or more items of property stolen on two or more separate occasions; or (2) Has received stolen property in another transaction within the two years preceding the transaction charged; or (3) Being a person in the business of buying or selling property of the sort received, acquires the property without having ascertained by reasonable inquiry that the person from whom he obtained it had a legal right to possess and dispose of it; or (4) Is found in possession of two or more defaced access devices; or (5) Is found in possession of property of a cargo carrier without proper documentation or other evidence of right to possession. c. For purposes of grading of an offense under this section, the amount involved shall be determined by the trier of fact.  The amount shall include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of any State tax avoided, evaded or otherwise unpaid, improperly retained or disposed of.  Amounts involved may be aggregated to include any property unlawfully possessed by the person that was acquired within the preceding two years through one or more acts in violation of chapters 15, 18, 20, or 21 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes, whether or not the actor committed the underlying violation, and may include any such property that the actor disposed of for value within the preceding two years.  Notwithstanding subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:1-9, if the actor was convicted of a prior offense under this section within the prior two years, the amount determined in the prior offense may be used for aggregation in the prosecution of the most recent offense. (cf: P.L.2023, c.101, s.5) 3. Section 7 of P.L.1981, c.167 (C.2C:20-7.1) is amended to read as follows: 7.    Fencing. a. Possession of altered property. Any dealer in property who knew or should have known that the identifying features such as serial numbers and permanently affixed labels of property in his possession have been removed or altered without the consent of the manufacturer is guilty of possession of altered property.  It is a defense to a prosecution under this subsection that a person lawfully possesses the usual indicia of ownership in addition to mere possession.  A prosecution for a violation of this subsection shall not preclude any criminal, civil, or administrative enforcement action for the intentional advertisement, sale, or distribution of an adulterated, counterfeit, misbranded, or mislabeled product. b. (1) Dealing in stolen property. A person is guilty of dealing in stolen property if he traffics in, or initiates, organizes, plans, finances, directs, manages or supervises trafficing in stolen property.  This paragraph shall not apply to dealing in stolen property consisting of a domestic companion animal, addressed in paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)   Dealing in stolen domestic companion animals. A person is guilty of dealing in stolen domestic companion animals if he trafficks in, or initiates, organizes, plans, finances, directs, manages or supervises trafficking in stolen property consisting of a domestic companion animal. c. (1) [For any] A violation of this section, other than dealing in stolen domestic companion animals, shall be graded as a theft offense in accordance with subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:20-2. [the] The value of the property involved in the violation shall be determined by the trier of fact for the purpose of determining the grade of the offense [, and] .  [the] The value of the property involved in the violation may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense where the acts or conduct constituting a violation were committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether in a single episode or transaction or across multiple episodes or transactions, whether [from] against the same [person] victim or several [persons] victims, or whether committed in a single county or across multiple counties.  Evidence that multiple episodes or transactions constitute one scheme or course of conduct may include, but is not limited to, evidence that the acts involve the same defendant or defendants, are substantially similar in nature, and occur within a two-year period.  Notwithstanding subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:1-9, if the actor was convicted of a prior offense under this section within the prior two years, the amount determined in the prior offense may be used for aggregation in the prosecution of the most recent offense. (2)   A violation of this section for dealing in stolen domestic companion animals constitutes a crime of the third degree. d.    It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that the actor: (1)   Was unaware that the property or service was that of another; (2)   Acted under an honest claim of right to the property or service involved or that he had a right to acquire or dispose of it as he did. e.     In addition to the presumptions contained in subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:20-7, the following presumptions are available in the prosecution for a fencing offense: (1)   Proof of the purchase or sale of property at a price substantially below its fair market value, unless satisfactorily explained, gives rise to an inference that the person buying or selling the property knew that it had been stolen; (2)   Proof of the purchase or sale of property by a dealer in that property, out of the regular course of business, or without the usual indicia of ownership other than mere possession, or the property or the job lot of which it is a part was bought, received, possessed or controlled in broken succession of title, so that it cannot be traced, by appropriate documents, in unbroken succession to the manufacturer, in all cases where the regular course of business reasonably indicates records of purchase, transfer or sale, unless satisfactorily explained, gives rise to an inference that the person buying or selling the property knew that it had been stolen; and (3)   Proof that a person buying or selling property of the sort received obtained such property without having ascertained by reasonable inquiry that the person from whom he obtained it had a legal right to possess or control it gives rise to an inference that such person knew that it had been stolen. (cf.: P.L.2017, c.156, s.1) 4. Section 1 of P.L.2023, c.101 (C.2C:20-10.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    Theft of a motor vehicle. a.     A person commits the crime of theft of a motor vehicle if the person unlawfully takes, or exercises unlawful control over, another person's motor vehicle with the purpose to deprive that person of the motor vehicle. b.    Theft of a motor vehicle constitutes a crime of the second degree if the value of the motor vehicle involved is $75,000 or more or if the theft involved more than one motor vehicle, otherwise it is a crime of the third degree. c.     The value of the motor vehicle involved in the theft shall be determined by the trier of fact.  The amount shall include, but not be limited to, the amount of any State tax avoided, evaded, or otherwise unpaid, or improperly retained or disposed of. Amounts involved in thefts of motor vehicles committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether in a single episode or transaction or across multiple episodes or transactions, whether [from] against the same [person] victim or several [persons] victims, or whether committed in a single county or across multiple counties, may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense.  Evidence that multiple episodes or transactions constitute one scheme or course of conduct may include, but is not limited to, evidence that the acts involve the same defendant or defendants, are substantially similar in nature, and occur within a two-year period.  Notwithstanding subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:1-9, if the actor was convicted of a prior offense under this section within the prior two years, the amount determined in the prior offense may be used for aggregation in the prosecution of the most recent offense. (cf: P.L.2021, c.101, s.1) 5. Section 2 of P.L.2023, c.101 (C.2C:20-10.2) is amended to read as follows: 2. a. Receiving a stolen motor vehicle. A person is guilty of receiving a stolen motor vehicle if the person knowingly receives or brings into this State a motor vehicle that is the property of another knowing that it has been stolen, or believing that it is probably stolen.  Receiving a stolen motor vehicle is a crime of the second degree if the value of the motor vehicle is $75,000 or more, otherwise it is a crime of the third degree. b.    It is an affirmative defense that the property was received with the purpose to restore it to the owner. c.     Permissive inference.

For the purposes of this section, receiving means acquiring possession, control or title, or lending on the security of the motor vehicle. d. For purposes of grading of an offense under subsection a. of this section, the value of the motor vehicle shall be determined by the trier of fact.  The value shall include, but shall not be limited to, the amount of any State tax avoided, evaded or otherwise unpaid, improperly retained or disposed of.  Value may be aggregated to include the value of any other stolen motor vehicle unlawfully possessed by the person that was acquired within the preceding two years through one or more acts in violation of chapters 15, 18, 20, or 21 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes, whether or not the actor committed the underlying violation, and may include any such motor vehicles that the actor disposed of for value within the preceding two years.  Notwithstanding subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:1-9, if the actor has already been convicted of a prior offense under this section within the preceding two years, the amount determined in the prior offense or offenses may be used for aggregation in the prosecution of the most recent offense. (cf: P.L.2023, c.101, s.2) 6. N.J.S.2C:20-11 is amended to read as follows: 2C:20-11. a. Definitions.

(cf: P.L.2006, c.56, s.1) 7. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the provisions found in several of the theft statutes concerning the aggregation of the value of stolen property. Current law allows the value of stolen property to be aggregated so that a higher degree of crime can be charged if the property being aggregated was stolen pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.  The bill clarifies that one scheme or course of conduct can be carried out across multiple criminal episodes or transactions, against the same or several victims, or across a single county or multiple counties. Under the bill, evidence that multiple episodes or transactions constitute one scheme or course of conduct may include, but is not limited to, evidence that the acts involve the same defendant or defendants, are substantially similar in nature, and occur within a two-year period. Under the consolidated theft statute, N.J.S.A.2C:20-2, theft is a crime of the second degree if the amount involved is $75,000 or more.  Theft is a crime of the third degree if the amount is more than $500 but less than $75,000.  Theft is a crime of the fourth degree if the amount is between $200 and $500.  Theft is a disorderly persons offense if the amount is less than $200.  These same monetary amounts also apply when grading the level of offense for receiving stolen property, fencing stolen property, and shoplifting.  Concerning motor vehicle theft and receiving stolen motor vehicles, these are crimes of the second degree if the value of the vehicle is $75,000 or more; otherwise they are crimes of the third degree. A crime of the second degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of five to ten years, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.  A crime of the third degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of three to five years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  A disorderly persons offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.
