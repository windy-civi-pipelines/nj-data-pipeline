It shall be no defense to a prosecution for a violation of subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that the defendant was unaware that the prohibited conduct took place while on or within 1,000 feet of any school property or while driving through a school crossing.  Nor shall it be a defense to a prosecution under subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that no juveniles were present on the school property or crossing zone at the time of the offense or that the school was not in session.

A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.

SIMPLE ASSAULT AGAINST A MINOR. If the simple assault is committed against a minor under the age of 18, the person is guilty of a crime of the third degree, with additional sentencing provisions as set out in the bill.  A crime of the third degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of five to 10 years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both. Under the bill, a person convicted of this third degree crime is to be sentenced to: (1) a fine of not less than $2,500 for a first offense, $10,000 for a second offense, and $15,000 for a third or subsequent offense; (2) exclusion from all school or community sponsored youth sports events for a period of not less than two years and up to five years; and (3) participation in anger management training of a period of not less than 50 hours, subject to the discretion of the anger management training facilitator The bill provides that a person sentenced to a crime of the fourth degree for assault against a sports official or participant is to be sentenced to: (1) a fine of not less than $1,000 for a first offense, $5,000 for a second offense, and $10,000 for a third or subsequent offense; (2) exclusion from all school or community sponsored youth sports events for a period of not less than one year and up to four years; and (3) participation in anger management training of a period of not less than 20 hours, subject to the discretion of the anger management training facilitator. AGGRAVATED ASSAULT. The bill provides that a person who commits an aggravated assault against a sports official, player, or participant is guilty of a crime of the third degree and is subject to the additional penalties set forth in the bill. Current law provides that a person is guilty of aggravated assault if the person: (1)   attempts to cause serious bodily injury to another, or causes injury purposely or knowingly or under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life recklessly causes such injury; or (2)   attempts to cause or purposely or knowingly causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon; or (3)   recklessly causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon; or (4)   knowingly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life points a firearm at or in the direction of another, whether or not the person believes it to be loaded. A person also is guilty of aggravated assault under current law if the person commits a simple assault against certain persons, such as law enforcement officers, teachers, health care workers, and others. HARASSMENT. In addition, the bill increases the penalties for harassment if committed against a sports official or participant. Currently, harassment is a petty disorderly persons offense, punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 30 days, a fine of up to $500, or both. Under the bill, it would be a crime of the fourth degree to commit harassment against a sports official: (1) while the sports official is engaged in conducting, supervising, refereeing, or officiating at a sanctioned interscholastic, recreational, private, or collegiate sports event; (2) in the immediate vicinity of a sports event, if the harassment arises out of the sports officials performance in the sports event; or (3)  while the player is engaged in a sports event, and prior to and after the event.
