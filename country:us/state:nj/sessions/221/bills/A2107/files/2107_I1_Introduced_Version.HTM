<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish the
New Jersey Commission on Poverty Elimination and Economic Security
(commission), and the Interagency Working Group on Poverty and Economic
Insecurity (interagency working group) in, but not of, the Department of
Human Services.  Notwithstanding this allocation, the commission and the
interagency working group will be independent of any supervision or control by
the department or any officer or employee thereof.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission is to be
composed of 25 voting members, including four members of the legislative branch
of government, one member of the judicial branch of government, and 20 public
members.  The members of the newly established interagency working group will
also serve as ex officio non-voting members of the commission.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of the commission
will be to:  1) improve policymakers understanding of poverty, including its
root causes, and its impacts on various measures of economic stability and
economic outcomes, including educational attainment levels, rates of
incarceration, lifetime earnings rates, access to housing, access to health
care, and health care outcomes; 2) support governmental efforts to ensure that
residents of the State have the equal opportunity to achieve economic security;
and 3) develop a strategic plan to address poverty and economic insecurity in
the State, as provided by the bill, and otherwise provide recommendations to
the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, to reduce and
ultimately eliminate poverty and economic insecurity in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The strategic plan is to be
developed within 18 months after the bills effective date.  The general goals
of the strategic plan will be to:  1) ensure that State programs and services
targeting poverty and economic insecurity reflect the goal of helping
individuals and families to rise above poverty and achieve long-term economic
stability, rather than simply providing relief from deprivation; 2) eliminate
disparate rates of poverty, deep poverty, child poverty, and intergenerational
poverty that are based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation or
identity, English language proficiency, ability, or geographic location in a
rural, urban, or suburban area; 3) reduce deep poverty in the State by 50
percent by 2026; 4) eliminate child poverty in the State by 2031; and 5)
eliminate all poverty in the State by 2036.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In developing the strategic
plan, the commission will be required to collaborate with the interagency
working group established under the bill, and will further be required to hold
at least six public hearings in different geographic regions of the State,
including regions that have disparate rates of poverty or historical experience
with economic insecurity, in order to collect information, take testimony, and
solicit input and feedback from interested parties, including members of the
public who have personal experience with State programs and services targeting
poverty, deep poverty, child poverty, intergenerational poverty, and economic
insecurity.  Information collected will be made available to the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The strategic plan is to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    identify, or provide for
the development of, fact-based measures to be used both in identifying rates of
poverty and economic insecurity in the State and in evaluating the long-term
effectiveness of existing and proposed programs and services targeting poverty
and economic insecurity in the State; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    evaluate the current
status of, and establish interim goals for the improvement, throughout the
State, of:  access to adequate food and nutrition; access to affordable and
quality health care; equal access to safe and affordable housing; equal access
to quality education and training; equal access to affordable, quality
post-secondary education options; access to dependable and affordable
transportation; access to quality and affordable child care; opportunities to
engage in meaningful and sustainable work that pays a living wage; barriers
that prevent low-income individuals in poverty from accessing available
affordable housing, nutritious food, quality health care, education,
transportation, and child care, from utilizing programs and services available
to address poverty and economic instability, or from accessing or taking
advantage of meaningful and sustainable work opportunities; equal access to
justice through a fair system of criminal justice that does not, in effect,
criminalize poverty; access to adequate income supports; and retirement
security;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)    provide various policy
and fiscal recommendations regarding the actions that should be undertaken by
State, local, and private actors, as appropriate, to address certain specified
issues related to poverty and economic insecurity.  For each recommendation,
the strategic plan is to identify, in measurable terms, the actual or potential
impact the recommendation will have on poverty and economic insecurity in the
State and on the achievement of the goals of the strategic plan; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4)    identify best practices
for the collection of data on various issues related to poverty and economic
insecurity.</p>

recommendation developed thereunder; 2) short-term, intermediate-term, and
long-term benchmarks to measure the States progress toward achieving the
general goals of the strategic plan, as outlined in the bill, and the specific
interim goals identified in the plan itself; and 3) a summary of the extent to
which the commission has collaborated with the interagency working group with respect
to the review and analysis of relevant data on poverty and economic insecurity.</p>

evaluating the status of the implementation of the strategic plan, and
providing any supplemental recommendations the commission deems necessary to
reduce or eliminate poverty and economic insecurity in the State, the first of
which is to be submitted one year after the publication of the commissions
strategic plan.</p>

Treasurer to include, in the materials that are submitted to the Legislature
outlining the Governors proposed annual budget, a description of any budget

impact on the State of successfully transitioning individuals and families from
poverty to long-term economic stability; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6)    establish an ongoing
system of data sharing, policy coordination, and communication among and within
State agencies, local agencies, and other organizations, including the
