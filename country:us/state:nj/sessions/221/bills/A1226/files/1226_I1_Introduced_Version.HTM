body of the county or by the appropriate board, as specified in the resolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     As used in this
section, agriculture development area, agricultural support business,
board, and unpreserved land mean the same as those terms are defined in

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would authorize a
county governing body, or the appropriate county or subregional agriculture
development board (board), as directed by the county governing body, to acquire
fee simple title to, and to sell or lease, certain lands situated in an
agricultural development area for use by an agricultural support business.  Agricultural
support business is defined, by the bill, to mean a for-profit or
not-for-profit business or enterprise, including, but not limited to, one
operated cooperatively by a collective group of farmers, which supplies needed
equipment, supplies, or services to the surrounding agricultural community and,
thereby, has a direct and positive impact on agriculture.  The term would
include, but not be limited to, the following types of businesses or
enterprises:  a veterinary practice and any other type of practice, shop, store,
or facility that supplies necessary food, temporary shelter, or medical care or
support for farm animals; any shop, store, or other facility that supplies
seeds, fertilizers, agricultural tools or equipment, or agricultural vehicles
or machinery to the surrounding agricultural community; any practice, shop, store,
garage, or other facility that engages in the repair or servicing of tractors
or other agricultural vehicles, equipment, tools, or machinery; any tack shop,
store, or other facility that sells equestrian supplies, apparel, equipment,
horse care products, grooming supplies, horse blankets and sheets, model
horses, or equine-related books, magazines, and videos; any shop, store, or
other facility that sells or provides storage for natural or synthetic
agricultural chemicals or other substances that are used to protect, or promote
the growth of, plants or animals, including, but not limited to, fertilizers,
pesticides, herbicides, growth regulators, animal feed supplements, urea,
animal vaccines or antibiotics, or raw materials used in agriculture-related
chemical processes; and any auction house or other facility that is used to
temporarily house, showcase, or sell produce or livestock being offered for
sale at auction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bills provisions, a
county would be authorized to acquire unpreserved land in an agricultural
development area, for use by an agricultural support business, so long as the
land so acquired does not constitute preserved farmland (i.e., is not subject
to a development easement conveyed, or to agricultural deed restrictions
imposed, for farmland preservation purposes), and the governing body of the county,
or the appropriate board, determines that the use of such land by an
agricultural support business would benefit and promote the long-term viability
of agricultural operations being undertaken in the agriculture development
area, including on preserved farmlands situated therein, and would, thereby,
facilitate and enhance the preferred use of the area for agriculture.  The
acquisition of land, by a county, for these purposes, may not be effectuated
through the exercise of eminent domain, or through condemnation proceedings,
but is to be effectuated through purchase, gift, devise, exchange, or other
appropriate means, as authorized by resolution of the governing body, adopted
pursuant to the Local Lands and Buildings Law, P.L.1971, c.199 (C.40A:12-1 et
seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would authorize a
county governing body or board to establish one or more agricultural support
working groups, composed of farmers, agricultural support business owners or
operators, and appropriate agricultural and environmental experts, to advise
the governing body or board regarding the appropriateness of land acquisitions
being considered, proposed, or effectuated pursuant to the bill.  Any such
agricultural support working group may be authorized to:  (1) study, and
provide the governing body or board with its findings and recommendations
regarding, the feasibility, need for, and appropriateness of acquiring land in
an agriculture development area for use by an agricultural support business;
(2) identify particular parcels of land in an agriculture development area, the
use of which by an agricultural support business would be most consistent with,
and would best facilitate, current and future agricultural activities being
undertaken in the agriculture development area; and (3) undertake any other
reviews, or engage in other investigatory and deliberative actions, as may be
necessary to facilitate the requisite determinations being made by the
governing body or board with respect to the acquisition of land under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would further provide
that, whenever a county acquires unpreserved land in an agriculture development
area, for the bills purposes, or whenever the governing body determines that
unpreserved land currently owned by the county in an agriculture development
area, with or without improvements, is no longer needed for county purposes,
the county may, by resolution, authorize the private sale and conveyance of
such unpreserved land, or any part thereof, to an agriculture support business
for such consideration as may be mutually agreed upon, including for
consideration that is less than the fair market value of the land, provided
that the agreement of sale contains express restrictions, which are recorded in
the deed, and which:  (1) require the land, and any improvements thereon, to be
used exclusively, by the buyer, for purposes of the agricultural support
business; (2) provide for the fee simple title to revert to the county upon any
violation of the agreements use restrictions by the buyer and following the
provision of written notice thereof to the buyer and any associated hearing on
the matter, which may be requested by the buyer within 30 days after receipt of
the written notice of violation; and (3) specify that, in any case involving
the future sale of the property, the county is to have the right of first
refusal to adopt and accept the terms and conditions of the proposed purchase
agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also enable a
county, by resolution, to authorize the lease of such unpreserved land, or any
part thereof, to an agriculture support business for such period,
consideration, and other terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon,
including for consideration that is less than the going lease rate for
similarly situated properties, provided that the lease agreement contains
express restrictions that:  (1) require the land, and any improvements thereon,
to be used, by the lessee, exclusively for purposes of the agricultural support
business; (2) provide for the lease agreement to be subject to immediate
termination, for any violation of the leases use restrictions, following the
provision of written notice of the violation to the lessee and any associated
hearing on the matter, which may be requested by the lessee within 30 days
after receipt of the written notice of violation; and (3) prohibit the lessee
from assigning or transferring the lease to any other person without the prior
consent and approval of the lessor county or board.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The acquisition, sale, or
lease of unpreserved land in an agriculture development area, which is
undertaken for the bills purposes, may be effectuated either by the county
governing body or by the appropriate board, on the governing bodys behalf, as
directed by the governing body.  Each board would additionally be required to
make appropriate recommendations to the governing body of the county regarding
the countys acquisition, resale, and lease of unpreserved land in an
agricultural development area, and undertake appropriate action to monitor and
enforce the compliance of agricultural support businesses with the deed or
lease restrictions that are imposed, pursuant to the bill, in association with
their purchase or lease of unpreserved land in an agricultural development
area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The availability and
accessibility of agricultural support businesses is essential and integral to
ensuring the ongoing viability and success of agricultural operations occurring
in the State, and the siting and operation of such businesses in agriculture
development areas, in accordance with the restrictions imposed by the bill,
would effectively compliment, and be fully consistent with, the preferred, but
non-exclusive, use of such areas for agriculture.</p>
