<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.   The director shall,
as soon as possible after learning of the law enforcement incident, determine
which State or county law enforcement agency shall serve as the independent
investigator, taking into account the provisions set forth in this section,
unless the selected law enforcement agency is unable to do so because of an
actual, potential, or perceived conflict of interest.  In this case, the
director shall mitigate the conflict or identify another agency to serve as
independent investigator. </p>

investigator shall not be the law enforcement agency that employs the principal
of the investigation, possess any other actual, potential, or perceived
conflict of interest pursuant to section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill), or rely on the investigative
assistance of any person who works for the same law enforcement agency as the
principal, except as provided in section 6 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

law enforcement officer resulting in death or serious bodily injury likely to
result in death; </p>

during an encounter with a law enforcement officer; </p>

while in the custody of law enforcement, where the death could plausibly be
linked to the actions of a law enforcement officer, whether through the
intentional use of force or a reckless indifference to human life; </p>

safety or privacy of that person.  The editing shall be done in a manner that
does not conceal the actions of any person who is using physical force against
another.  Any digital blurring shall be made to a copy of the recording
intended for public release.  The independent investigator shall not alter the
master copy of the recording. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   If the independent
investigator possesses footage recorded by anyone other than a law enforcement

refrain from presenting the grand jury with a draft charging document.  In this
case, the independent investigator may instruct the grand jury on its ability
to issue a presentment addressing matters of public policy in cases in which no
criminal charges are returned by the grand jury. </p>

permitted to share investigative information.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, the bill sets forth
the standards for releasing law enforcement footage.  The bill defines law
enforcement footage as recordings captured by a law enforcement officers
body-worn camera, a camera mounted in an officers patrol car, a camera
embedded in an officers conductive energy device, a surveillance or security
camera, or a camera or smartphone belonging to a witness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, at the
conclusion of the investigation, the independent investigator is to prepare a
summary of their factual findings, legal analysis, and preliminary
recommendations as to whether any principal of the investigation should be
criminally charged for their involvement in the law enforcement incident.  The
findings, legal analysis, and preliminary charging recommendation are required
to be submitted for an independent assessment by the independent supervisory
reviewer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also sets forth the
cases which require the independent investigator to present evidence to the
grand jury concerning the law enforcement incident and sets forth the actions
required by the independent investigator.  In cases where the matter is not
presented to the grand jury or where the matter is presented, but the grand
jury declines to criminally charge any of the principals of the investigation,
the independent investigator is to prepare a statement for public dissemination
which is to comply with all rules of grand jury secrecy and be reviewed by the
independent supervisory reviewer prior to release. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, where a death
of a person occurs while the person is in the custody of law enforcement and
plausibly could be linked to the actions of the law enforcement officer,
whether through the intentional use of force or a reckless indifference to
human life, the OPIA is required to investigate the matter in accordance with
the provisions of this bill.  Where the death cannot be plausibly linked to the
actions of the law enforcement officer, the office is to supervise the
investigation according to procedures established in the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires
each county prosecutor to undertake efforts to educate residents in the county
about the bills provisions and report to the Attorney General on public
education efforts.</p>
