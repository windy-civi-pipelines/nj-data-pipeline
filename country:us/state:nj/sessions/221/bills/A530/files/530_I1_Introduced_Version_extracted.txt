(2)   A grant issued pursuant to this section may be used for stormwater and nonpoint source pollution management activities that would, as determined by the department, directly enhance, improve, or protect the use of a lake for recreation and conservation purposes. (3)   (a)   An application received by the department from the Greenwood Lake Commission for funding pursuant to this section shall be approved by the department and shall receive a minimum grant award of $750,000 in each fiscal year.  A grant awarded to the Greenwood Lake Commission pursuant to this section shall be used solely for development for recreation and conservation purposes of that part of Greenwood Lake which lies within the State, and may be utilized without matching funds from substantially similar legislation by the State of New York. (b)   An application received by the department from the Lake Hopatcong Commission for funding pursuant to this section shall be approved by the department and shall receive a minimum grant award of $750,000 in each fiscal year. c.     (1)     Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-55 et seq.) to the contrary, each fiscal year, the department shall submit a list of qualified entities and a description of the projects to receive funding pursuant to this section to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly to be introduced in each House in the form of legislative appropriations bills.  The Legislature may approve one or more appropriation bills containing a project list or lists submitted by the department pursuant to this subsection. (2)   The department shall not submit, and the Legislature shall not approve, any other list of projects to receive funding pursuant to P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) until the department has submitted to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly the list required pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. d.    As used in this section: Greenwood Lake Commission means the commission created pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1999, c.402 (C.32:20A-3).  Highlands Region means the region as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3). Lake Hopatcong Commission means the commission created pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.175 (C.54:4B-3). Qualified entity means the Greenwood Lake Commission, the Lake Hopatcong Commission, or a local government unit. Pinelands area means the pinelands area as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-3). 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend and supplement the Preserve New Jersey Act to allocate $10 million annually from constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues for providing grants to assist certain entities to pay the cost of development of lands for recreation and conservation purposes for the management and maintenance of lakes.  The bill directs the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to establish a program for the issuance of these grants. The bill requires the DEP to develop criteria for the evaluation and ranking of applications to provide priority to projects located in the Highlands Region and Pinelands area and to improve water quality and increase recreational access and use of lakes, including projects to control nutrient levels in lakes in order to prevent future harmful algal blooms.  The bill provides priority for funding for projects located in the Highlands Region and Pinelands area in recognition of the critical role lakes in these ecologically significant locations provide in the supply of drinking water to residents throughout the State, watershed protection, and for recreation and conservation purposes. The bill provides that a grant issued pursuant to the bill may be used for stormwater and nonpoint source pollution management activities, if the DEP determines that those activities would directly enhance, improve, or protect the use of a lake for recreation and conservation purposes.  Harmful algal blooms occur when colonies of microscopic algae or bacteria grow at exponential rates and produce toxins harmful to humans and animals.  Exposure to these algal blooms can cause a range of health effects, including skin rashes, allergy-like reactions, flu-like symptoms, gastroenteritis, respiratory irritation and eye irritation. The issuance by the DEP of no contact advisories or other warnings cautioning against contact with the water in certain lakes due to the presence of harmful algal blooms directly impacts the publics use of lakes for recreation and conservation purposes.  Certain stormwater and nonpoint source pollution management activities may control harmful algal blooms, which would result in improvements to water quality and increase recreational access to lakes. The Greenwood Lake Commission, the Lake Hopatcong Commission, and local government units may apply for grants pursuant to the bill.  The DEP would be required to approve any applications submitted by the Greenwood Lake Commission and the Lake Hopatcong Commission, and each commission would receive a minimum grant award of $750,000 in each fiscal year under the bill. The funding in this bill is provided from constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues pursuant to Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution, approved by the voters of the State in November 2014.  The Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), implements the constitutional dedication of CBT revenues for open space, farmland, and historic preservation.  The act provides that a certain amount of the portion of dedicated CBT revenues allocated each year for the Green Acres program is to be used for:  the acquisition of lands for open space, including Blue Acres projects, and development projects, including stewardship activities, on State lands administered by the DEPs Division of Fish and Wildlife and Division of Parks and Forestry; grants and loans to fund local government open space acquisition and development projects; and grants to nonprofit entities to acquire or develop lands for recreation and conservation purposes.  The Preserve New Jersey Green Acres Fund was established by section 6 of the Preserve New Jersey Act. This bill provides that $10 million of the amount currently allocated for development of lands by the State for recreation and conservation purposes would be used instead to fund the grants to be awarded pursuant to the bill. The bill requires the DEP, each fiscal year, to submit a list of projects to receive funding pursuant to the bill to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly to be introduced in the Legislature as appropriations bills.  The bill further provides that the DEP shall not submit, and the Legislature shall not approve, any other list of projects to receive funding pursuant to the Preserve New Jersey Act until the DEP has submitted to the Legislature the list of projects recommended to receive funding pursuant to the program established by the bill. The Preserve New Jersey Act defines the terms development, recreation and conservation purposes, and stewardship.  Development means any improvement, including a stewardship activity, made to a land or water area designed to expand and enhance its utilization for recreation and conservation purposes, and includes the construction, renovation, or repair of any such improvement, but does not mean shore protection or beach nourishment or replenishment activities.  Recreation and conservation purposes means the use of lands for beaches, biological or ecological study, boating, camping, fishing, forests, greenways, hunting, natural areas, parks, playgrounds, protecting historic properties, water reserves, watershed protection, wildlife preserves, active sports, or a similar use for either public outdoor recreation or conservation of natural resources, or both. Stewardship activity means an activity, which is beyond routine operations and maintenance, undertaken by the State, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization to repair, or restore lands acquired or developed for recreation and conservation purposes for the purpose of enhancing or protecting those lands for recreation and conservation purposes.

(b)   To qualify to receive a grant from the Preserve New Jersey Blue Acres Fund, the board of directors or governing body of the applying tax exempt nonprofit organization shall: (i)    demonstrate to the commissioner that the organization qualifies as a charitable conservancy for the purposes of P.L.1979, c.378 (C.13:8B-1 et seq.); (ii)   demonstrate that the organization has the resources to match the grant requested; (iii)   agree to make and keep the lands accessible to the public, unless the commissioner determines that public accessibility would be detrimental to the lands or any natural resources associated therewith; (iv)   agree not to convey the lands except to the federal government, the State, a local government unit, or another qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization, for recreation and conservation purposes; and (v)   agree to execute and donate to the State at no charge a conservation restriction pursuant to P.L.1979, c.378 (C.13:8B-1 et seq.) on the lands to be acquired with the grant. l.     In addition to any other reporting requirements required by law, the department shall annually send a written report to the Chairperson of the Senate Environment and Energy Committee, the Assembly Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, and the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee, or their successors, identifying the projects funded with moneys pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of subsection j. of this section.  This report shall:  (1) identify the project type, location, and cost for each development project; and (2) identify the stewardship activities, including the location and cost for each stewardship activity, undertaken on lands administered by the Division of Fish and Wildlife and Division of Parks and Forestry pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (1) of subsection j. of this section. (cf: P.L.2019, c.136, s.3) 2.    (New section)   a.   The department shall establish a program for the purpose of providing grants with the moneys allocated pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph (1) of subsection j. of section 6 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-48) to assist qualified entities to pay the cost of development of lands for the management and maintenance of lakes for recreation and conservation purposes. b.    (1)     In establishing the program required pursuant to this section, in addition to the provisions of section 24 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-24), and any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, the department shall develop criteria for the evaluation and ranking of applications to provide priority to projects: (a)   submitted by qualified entities located in the Highlands Region and Pinelands area; and (b)   to improve water quality and increase recreational access and use of lakes, including projects to control nutrient levels in lakes in order to prevent future harmful algal blooms. (2)   A grant issued pursuant to this section may be used for stormwater and nonpoint source pollution management activities that would, as determined by the department, directly enhance, improve, or protect the use of a lake for recreation and conservation purposes. (3)   (a)   An application received by the department from the Greenwood Lake Commission for funding pursuant to this section shall be approved by the department and shall receive a minimum grant award of $750,000 in each fiscal year.  A grant awarded to the Greenwood Lake Commission pursuant to this section shall be used solely for development for recreation and conservation purposes of that part of Greenwood Lake which lies within the State, and may be utilized without matching funds from substantially similar legislation by the State of New York. (b)   An application received by the department from the Lake Hopatcong Commission for funding pursuant to this section shall be approved by the department and shall receive a minimum grant award of $750,000 in each fiscal year. c.     (1)     Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-55 et seq.) to the contrary, each fiscal year, the department shall submit a list of qualified entities and a description of the projects to receive funding pursuant to this section to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly to be introduced in each House in the form of legislative appropriations bills.  The Legislature may approve one or more appropriation bills containing a project list or lists submitted by the department pursuant to this subsection. (2)   The department shall not submit, and the Legislature shall not approve, any other list of projects to receive funding pursuant to P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) until the department has submitted to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly the list required pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. d.    As used in this section: Greenwood Lake Commission means the commission created pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1999, c.402 (C.32:20A-3).  Highlands Region means the region as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3). Lake Hopatcong Commission means the commission created pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.175 (C.54:4B-3). Qualified entity means the Greenwood Lake Commission, the Lake Hopatcong Commission, or a local government unit. Pinelands area means the pinelands area as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-3). 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend and supplement the Preserve New Jersey Act to allocate $10 million annually from constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues for providing grants to assist certain entities to pay the cost of development of lands for recreation and conservation purposes for the management and maintenance of lakes.  The bill directs the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to establish a program for the issuance of these grants. The bill requires the DEP to develop criteria for the evaluation and ranking of applications to provide priority to projects located in the Highlands Region and Pinelands area and to improve water quality and increase recreational access and use of lakes, including projects to control nutrient levels in lakes in order to prevent future harmful algal blooms.  The bill provides priority for funding for projects located in the Highlands Region and Pinelands area in recognition of the critical role lakes in these ecologically significant locations provide in the supply of drinking water to residents throughout the State, watershed protection, and for recreation and conservation purposes. The bill provides that a grant issued pursuant to the bill may be used for stormwater and nonpoint source pollution management activities, if the DEP determines that those activities would directly enhance, improve, or protect the use of a lake for recreation and conservation purposes.  Harmful algal blooms occur when colonies of microscopic algae or bacteria grow at exponential rates and produce toxins harmful to humans and animals.  Exposure to these algal blooms can cause a range of health effects, including skin rashes, allergy-like reactions, flu-like symptoms, gastroenteritis, respiratory irritation and eye irritation. The issuance by the DEP of no contact advisories or other warnings cautioning against contact with the water in certain lakes due to the presence of harmful algal blooms directly impacts the publics use of lakes for recreation and conservation purposes.  Certain stormwater and nonpoint source pollution management activities may control harmful algal blooms, which would result in improvements to water quality and increase recreational access to lakes. The Greenwood Lake Commission, the Lake Hopatcong Commission, and local government units may apply for grants pursuant to the bill.  The DEP would be required to approve any applications submitted by the Greenwood Lake Commission and the Lake Hopatcong Commission, and each commission would receive a minimum grant award of $750,000 in each fiscal year under the bill. The funding in this bill is provided from constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues pursuant to Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution, approved by the voters of the State in November 2014.  The Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), implements the constitutional dedication of CBT revenues for open space, farmland, and historic preservation.  The act provides that a certain amount of the portion of dedicated CBT revenues allocated each year for the Green Acres program is to be used for:  the acquisition of lands for open space, including Blue Acres projects, and development projects, including stewardship activities, on State lands administered by the DEPs Division of Fish and Wildlife and Division of Parks and Forestry; grants and loans to fund local government open space acquisition and development projects; and grants to nonprofit entities to acquire or develop lands for recreation and conservation purposes.  The Preserve New Jersey Green Acres Fund was established by section 6 of the Preserve New Jersey Act. This bill provides that $10 million of the amount currently allocated for development of lands by the State for recreation and conservation purposes would be used instead to fund the grants to be awarded pursuant to the bill. The bill requires the DEP, each fiscal year, to submit a list of projects to receive funding pursuant to the bill to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly to be introduced in the Legislature as appropriations bills.  The bill further provides that the DEP shall not submit, and the Legislature shall not approve, any other list of projects to receive funding pursuant to the Preserve New Jersey Act until the DEP has submitted to the Legislature the list of projects recommended to receive funding pursuant to the program established by the bill. The Preserve New Jersey Act defines the terms development, recreation and conservation purposes, and stewardship.  Development means any improvement, including a stewardship activity, made to a land or water area designed to expand and enhance its utilization for recreation and conservation purposes, and includes the construction, renovation, or repair of any such improvement, but does not mean shore protection or beach nourishment or replenishment activities.  Recreation and conservation purposes means the use of lands for beaches, biological or ecological study, boating, camping, fishing, forests, greenways, hunting, natural areas, parks, playgrounds, protecting historic properties, water reserves, watershed protection, wildlife preserves, active sports, or a similar use for either public outdoor recreation or conservation of natural resources, or both. Stewardship activity means an activity, which is beyond routine operations and maintenance, undertaken by the State, a local government unit, or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization to repair, or restore lands acquired or developed for recreation and conservation purposes for the purpose of enhancing or protecting those lands for recreation and conservation purposes.
