section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lake Hopatcong Commission

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend and
supplement the Preserve New Jersey Act to allocate $10 million annually from
constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues for
providing grants to assist certain entities to pay the cost of development of lands
for recreation and conservation purposes for the management and maintenance of
lakes.  The bill directs the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to
establish a program for the issuance of these grants.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the DEP to
develop criteria for the evaluation and ranking of applications to provide
priority to projects located in the Highlands Region and Pinelands area and to
improve water quality and increase recreational access and use of lakes,
including projects to control nutrient levels in lakes in order to prevent
future harmful algal blooms.  The bill provides priority for funding for
projects located in the Highlands Region and Pinelands area in recognition of
the critical role lakes in these ecologically significant locations provide in
the supply of drinking water to residents throughout the State, watershed
protection, and for recreation and conservation purposes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a grant
issued pursuant to the bill may be used for stormwater and nonpoint source
pollution management activities, if the DEP determines that those activities
would directly enhance, improve, or protect the use of a lake for recreation
and conservation purposes.  Harmful algal blooms occur when colonies of
microscopic algae or bacteria grow at exponential rates and produce toxins
harmful to humans and animals.  Exposure to these algal blooms can cause a
range of health effects, including skin rashes, allergy-like reactions,
flu-like symptoms, gastroenteritis, respiratory irritation and eye irritation. 
The issuance by the DEP of no contact advisories or other warnings cautioning
against contact with the water in certain lakes due to the presence of harmful
algal blooms directly impacts the publics use of lakes for recreation and
conservation purposes.  Certain stormwater and nonpoint source pollution
management activities may control harmful algal blooms, which would result in
improvements to water quality and increase recreational access to lakes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Greenwood Lake Commission,
the Lake Hopatcong Commission, and local government units may apply for grants
pursuant to the bill.  The DEP would be required to approve any applications
submitted by the Greenwood Lake Commission and the Lake Hopatcong Commission,
and each commission would receive a minimum grant award of $750,000 in each
fiscal year under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The funding in this bill is
provided from constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT)
revenues pursuant to Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 6 of the State
Constitution, approved by the voters of the State in November 2014.  The
Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), implements the
constitutional dedication of CBT revenues for open space, farmland, and
historic preservation.  The act provides that a certain amount of the portion
of dedicated CBT revenues allocated each year for the Green Acres program is to
be used for:  the acquisition of lands for open space, including Blue Acres
projects, and development projects, including stewardship activities, on State
lands administered by the DEPs Division of Fish and Wildlife and Division of
Parks and Forestry; grants and loans to fund local government open space
acquisition and development projects; and grants to nonprofit entities to
acquire or develop lands for recreation and conservation purposes.  The
Preserve New Jersey Green Acres Fund was established by section 6 of the
Preserve New Jersey Act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that $10
million of the amount currently allocated for development of lands by the State
for recreation and conservation purposes would be used instead to fund the
grants to be awarded pursuant to the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the DEP,
each fiscal year, to submit a list of projects to receive funding pursuant to
the bill to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly
to be introduced in the Legislature as appropriations bills.  The bill further
provides that the DEP shall not submit, and the Legislature shall not approve,
any other list of projects to receive funding pursuant to the Preserve New
Jersey Act until the DEP has submitted to the Legislature the list of projects
recommended to receive funding pursuant to the program established by the bill.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Preserve New Jersey Act
defines the terms development, recreation and conservation purposes, and
stewardship.  Development means any improvement, including a stewardship
activity, made to a land or water area designed to expand and enhance its
utilization for recreation and conservation purposes, and includes the
construction, renovation, or repair of any such improvement, but does not mean
shore protection or beach nourishment or replenishment activities.  Recreation
and conservation purposes means the use of lands for beaches, biological or ecological
study, boating, camping, fishing, forests, greenways, hunting, natural areas,
parks, playgrounds, protecting historic properties, water reserves, watershed
protection, wildlife preserves, active sports, or a similar use for either
public outdoor recreation or conservation of natural resources, or both. 
Stewardship activity means an activity, which is beyond routine operations
and maintenance, undertaken by the State, a local government unit, or a
qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization to repair, or restore lands
acquired or developed for recreation and conservation purposes for the purpose
of enhancing or protecting those lands for recreation and conservation
purposes.</p>
