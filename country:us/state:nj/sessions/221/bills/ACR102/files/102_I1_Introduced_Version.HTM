STATEMENT This resolution respectfully urges the Department of Education to impose a moratorium on the development and implementation of new Student Learning Standards for a period of two years. The most recent Student Learning Standards were adopted by the State Board of Education in June 2020, however there has been considerable discontent among parents and guardians with regards to the standards.  As a result, there are numerous bills pending before the Legislature that may affect the Student Learning Standards. Additionally, the United States has been falling in the global education rankings, reaching its lowest level ever in overall competitiveness in the most recent administration of the Program for International Student Assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant learning loss for students around the State, exacerbating the United States decline compared to other countries. It would be appropriate to impose a moratorium while the Legislature considers bills that may impact the Student Learning Standards and that would focus on addressing learning loss.
