S1382 SENATE, No. 1382 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  MICHAEL L. TESTA, JR. District 1 (Atlantic, Cape May and Cumberland) Senator  PAUL A. SARLO District 36 (Bergen and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Exempts certain oversized vehicles from requirement of additional escort vehicle if transported load is properly illuminated during nighttime. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the illumination of loads on certain oversized vehicles and supplementing Title 39 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  Notwithstanding any provision of law or regulation to the contrary, when an oversized vehicle or combination of vehicles receives a special written permit pursuant to subsection d. of R.S.39:3-84, the vehicle or combination of vehicles is required to be accompanied by one or more escort vehicles, and the vehicle or combination of vehicles is required to be accompanied by an additional escort vehicle when traveling during the nighttime hours of sunset to sunrise, then the vehicle or combination of vehicles shall not be required to be accompanied by the additional escort vehicle during such nighttime hours if the load transported by the vehicle or combination of vehicles is illuminated with additional lighting so as to be clearly visible from 1,000 feet in all directions of traffic. 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides an exemption for certain oversized vehicles or combination of vehicles from the requirement to be accompanied by an additional escort vehicle when traveling during the nighttime hours of sunset to sunrise.  Specifically, these vehicles or combination of vehicles would not be required to be accompanied by an additional escort vehicle if the load transported by the vehicle or combination of vehicles is illuminated with additional lighting so as to be clearly visible from 1,000 feet in all directions of traffic. Currently, oversized vehicles or combinations of vehicles are required to receive a special written permit from the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission in order to be operated within the State, and depending on the size of the oversized vehicle or combination of vehicles, one or more escort vehicles may be required to accompany the vehicle.  However, under current State regulations, when an oversized vehicle or combination of vehicles is permitted to travel during the nighttime hours of sunset to sunrise, an additional escort vehicle is also required to accompany the vehicle or combination of vehicles.  This bill would provide an exemption to the requirement for an additional escort vehicle during nighttime hours when the load transported by the oversized vehicle or combination of vehicles is illuminated according to the bills provisions.
