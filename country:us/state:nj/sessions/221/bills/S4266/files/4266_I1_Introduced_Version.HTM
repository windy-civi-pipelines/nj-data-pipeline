<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  A health care entity
shall notify the division in writing if a health care professional who is
employed by, under contract to render professional services to, or has
privileges granted by, that health care entity, or who provides such services
pursuant to an agreement with a health care services firm or staffing registry:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   for reasons relating to
the health care professional's impairment, incompetency, or professional
misconduct, which incompetency or professional misconduct relates adversely to
patient care or safety: (a) has full or partial privileges summarily or
temporarily revoked or suspended, or permanently reduced, suspended, or
revoked; (b) has been removed from the list of eligible employees of a health
services firm or staffing registry; (c) has been discharged from the staff; or
(d) has had a contract to render professional services terminated or rescinded;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   has conditions or
limitations placed on the exercise of clinical privileges or practice within
the health care entity for reasons relating to the health care professional's
impairment, incompetency, or professional misconduct or, which incompetency or
professional misconduct relates adversely to patient care or safety, including,
but not limited to, second opinion requirements, non-routine concurrent or retrospective
review of admissions or care, non-routine supervision by one or more members of
the staff, or the completion of remedial education or training;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   voluntarily resigns from
the staff if: (a) the health care entity is reviewing the health care professional's
patient care or reviewing whether, based upon its reasonable belief, the health
care professional's conduct demonstrates an impairment or incompetence or is
unprofessional, which incompetence or unprofessional conduct relates adversely
to patient care or safety; or (b) the health care entity, through any member of
the medical or administrative staff, has expressed an intention to do such a
review;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   voluntarily relinquishes
any partial privilege or authorization to perform a specific procedure if: (a)
the health care entity is reviewing the health care professional's patient care
or reviewing whether, based upon its reasonable belief, the health care
professional's conduct demonstrates an impairment or incompetence or is
unprofessional, which incompetence or unprofessional conduct relates adversely
to patient care or safety; or (b) the health care entity, through any member of
the medical or administrative staff, has expressed an intention to do such a
review;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   while under, or
subsequent to, a review by the health care entity of the health care
professional's patient care or professional conduct is granted a leave of
absence for reasons relating to a physical, mental, or emotional condition or
drug or alcohol use which impairs the health care professional's ability to
practice with reasonable skill and safety, except that no report is required
for pregnancy-related leaves of absence or if the health care professional has
sought assistance from a professional assistance or intervention program
approved or designated by the division or a board to provide confidential
oversight of the health care professional and is following the treatment
regimen or monitoring as that program requires; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   is a party to a medical
malpractice liability suit, to which the health care entity is also a party,
and in which there is a settlement, judgment, or arbitration award.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this subsection,
incompetence, professional misconduct, and unprofessional conduct shall not
include personal conduct, such as tardiness, insubordination, or other similar
behavior, which does not relate to patient care or safety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A health care entity
shall notify the division in writing if it is in possession of information that
indicates that a health care professional has failed to comply with a request
to seek assistance from a professional assistance or intervention program
approved or designated by the division or a board to provide confidential
oversight of the health care professional, or has failed to follow the treatment
regimen or monitoring program required by that program to assure that the
health care professional's physical, mental, or emotional condition or drug or
alcohol use does not impair the health care professional's ability to practice
with reasonable skill and safety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A health care entity
shall notify the division in writing if any health care professional who has
been the subject of a report pursuant to this section, has had conditions or
limitations on the exercise of clinical privileges or practice within the
health care entity altered, or privileges restored, or has resumed exercising
clinical privileges that had been voluntarily relinquished. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    In the case of a health
care professional who is providing services at a health care entity pursuant to
an agreement with a health care services firm or staffing agency and is the
subject of a notice pursuant to this section, the health care entity shall,
when it submits a notice to the division concerning that health care
professional, provide a copy of the notice to the health care services firm or
staffing agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The form of
notification shall be prescribed by the Commissioner of Health, in consultation
with the Commissioner of Human Services in the case of psychiatric facilities
and developmental centers, and shall contain such information as may be
required by the division and shall be made within seven days of the date of the
action, settlement, judgment, or award.  </p>

which fails to provide such notice to the division or fails to cooperate with a
request for information by the division, the board or the Medical Practitioner
Review Panel established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.1989, c.300 (C.45:9-19.8)
shall be subject to such penalties as the Department of Health may determine
pursuant to sections 13 and 14 of P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-13 and 26:2H-14).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    A health care entity, or
any employee thereof, which provides information to the division, the board,
the Medical Practitioner Review Panel, a health care services firm or staffing
agency, or the Department of Health, in good faith and without malice,
regarding a health care professional pursuant to the provisions of this section
or section 3 of P.L.1989, c.300 (C.26:2H-12.2a), is not liable for civil
damages in any cause of action arising out of the provision or reporting of the

for that disqualification, except that the information shall indicate that the
person was convicted of a crime or disorderly persons offense as described in

equivalent of at least two years of full time employment in the other state or
territory as a nurse aide and the most recent date of such employment is within
the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of the application.  The
board shall require an individual applying for a certification to be entered on

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill modifies current law
governing certified nurse aides (CNAs) by transferring the regulation of CNAs
from the New Jersey Department of Health to the New Jersey Board of Nursing,
which is part of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and
Public Safety. Under the bill, references to CNAs in the law currently
governing the profession and references to CNAs in law attributing the
oversight of CNAs to the Department of Health are removed and substantively
identical language on the regulation of CNAs is added under the law governing
the New Jersey Board of Nursing or is added to provisions attributing CNA
oversight to the board. The board is authorized under the bill to promulgate
regulations to effectuate the purposes of the bill.</p>
