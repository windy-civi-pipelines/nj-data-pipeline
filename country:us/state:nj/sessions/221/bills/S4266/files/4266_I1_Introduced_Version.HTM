STATEMENT This bill modifies current law governing certified nurse aides (CNAs) by transferring the regulation of CNAs from the New Jersey Department of Health to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, which is part of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Under the bill, references to CNAs in the law currently governing the profession and references to CNAs in law attributing the oversight of CNAs to the Department of Health are removed and substantively identical language on the regulation of CNAs is added under the law governing the New Jersey Board of Nursing or is added to provisions attributing CNA oversight to the board. The board is authorized under the bill to promulgate regulations to effectuate the purposes of the bill.

(3)   The person terminated from employment pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall have 30 days from the date of the termination to petition the board for a hearing on the accuracy of the information about the conviction reported to the board or to establish why the person should not be terminated from employment, and disqualified from certification, as a nurse aide. The board shall notify the person's employer of the person's petition for a hearing within five days following the receipt of the petition from the person.  Upon the issuance of a final decision upon a petition to the board pursuant to this paragraph, the board shall notify the person and the person's employer as to whether: (a)   the person is to be reinstated in the person's employment as a nurse aide and retain the person's certification; or (b)   the person's termination from employment as a nurse aide stands and the person remains disqualified from certification. g.    The board shall provide for a registry of all persons who have successfully completed all training and competency evaluation requirements for certification as a nurse aide and shall provide for the inclusion in the registry of information about the disqualification of any person from certification pursuant to sections 8 through 11 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature); for which purposes, the board may use an existing registry established pursuant to statute or regulation, subject to the requirements of federal law.  The registry shall include the specific documented findings constituting the basis for that disqualification, except that the information shall indicate that the person was convicted of a crime or disorderly persons offense as described in section 8 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), but shall not identify the conviction or convictions which constitute the basis for the disqualification. 10.  (New section) The Department of Law and Public Safety shall assume the cost of the criminal history record background check conducted on an applicant for nurse aide certification, or a certified nurse aide, as the case may be, pursuant to sections 8 through 11 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature) and section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.53:1-20.9a). 11.  (New section) Any person submitting a false sworn statement pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000, which may be assessed by the board. 12.  (New section) An individual certified as a nurse aide by another state or territory of the United States may apply to have that certification entered on the registry established and maintained by the board pursuant to section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), provided that: a.     the board receives documentation from the other state or territory that the applicant holds a current, valid certification as a nurse aide in the state or territory; b.    the applicant has not been convicted of any crimes and has no documented findings of abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of resident property in the other state or territory; c.     the applicant complies with the criminal history record background check requirements set forth under sections 8 through 11 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and d. (1) the applicant has completed within the preceding 24 months the amount of continuing education hours required by regulation for a nurse aide; or (2)   the applicant has the equivalent of at least two years of full time employment in the other state or territory as a nurse aide and the most recent date of such employment is within the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of the application.  The board shall require an individual applying for a certification to be entered on the registry on the basis of work experience pursuant to this paragraph to complete any clinical skills competency examination and any written and oral competency examination the board may require pursuant to regulation, to verify the individual meets New Jersey's training and competency requirements. 13.  Section 1 of P.L.2019, c.18 (C.26:2H-87.1) is repealed. 14.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the 19th month next following enactment.  The New Jersey Board of Nursing may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance of the effective dates of this act as shall be necessary for implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill modifies current law governing certified nurse aides (CNAs) by transferring the regulation of CNAs from the New Jersey Department of Health to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, which is part of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Under the bill, references to CNAs in the law currently governing the profession and references to CNAs in law attributing the oversight of CNAs to the Department of Health are removed and substantively identical language on the regulation of CNAs is added under the law governing the New Jersey Board of Nursing or is added to provisions attributing CNA oversight to the board. The board is authorized under the bill to promulgate regulations to effectuate the purposes of the bill.
