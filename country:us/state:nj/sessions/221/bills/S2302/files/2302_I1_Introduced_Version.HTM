energy conservation construction requirements and revise these energy-efficient
building codes to require that new residential and commercial buildings be
constructed as zero energy ready buildings in accordance with the provisions of
P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.    Section 5 of P.L.1975,
c.217 (C.52:27D-123) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    a.  The commissioner
shall after public hearing pursuant to section 4 of the &quot;Administrative
Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-4) adopt a State Uniform
Construction Code for the purpose of regulating the structural design,
construction, maintenance, and use of buildings or structures to be erected and
alteration, renovation, rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, removal, or
demolition of buildings or structures already erected.  Prior to the adoption
of said code, the commissioner shall consult with the code advisory board and
other departments, divisions, bureaus, boards, councils, or other agencies of
State Government heretofore authorized to establish or administer construction
regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Such prior consultations with
departments, divisions, bureaus, boards, councils, or other agencies of State
Government shall include but not be limited to consultation with the
Commissioner of Health and the Public Health Council prior to adoption of a
plumbing subcode pursuant to paragraph b. of this section.  Said code shall
include any code, rule, or regulation incorporated therein by reference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The code shall be
divided into subcodes which may be adopted individually by the commissioner as
the commissioner may from time to time consider appropriate. These subcodes
shall include but not be limited to a building code, a plumbing code, an
electrical code, an energy code, a fire prevention code, a manufactured or
mobile home code, and a mechanical code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     These subcodes, except for the
energy subcode, shall be adoptions of the model codes of the Building Officials
and Code Administrators International, Inc., the National Electrical Code, and
the National Standard Plumbing Code, provided that for good reasons, the
commissioner may adopt as a subcode, a model code or standard of some other
nationally recognized organization upon a finding that such model code or
standard promotes the purposes of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.).  The initial
adoption of a model code or standard as a subcode shall constitute adoption of
subsequent edition year publications of the model code or standard of such
other nationally recognized organization, except as provided for in paragraphs
(1) through (4) of this subsection.  Adoption of publications shall not occur
more frequently than once every three years; provided, however, that a revision
or amendment may be adopted at any time in the event that the commissioner
finds that there exists an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or
welfare.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The energy subcode shall be
based upon the model codes cited under this subsection or the International
Energy Conservation Code<u>; provided, however, that the energy subcode shall
be revised as necessary to comply with the requirements of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill)</u>.  It may be amended or
supplemented by the commissioner once before 2012 without regard to intervals
between the adoption of the energy subcode in effect on the effective date of
P.L.2009, c.106 (C.52:27D-122.2 et al.) and subsequent year revisions of that
subcode.  In amending or supplementing the energy subcode, the commissioner
shall rely upon 10-year energy price projections provided by an institution of
higher education within one year following the effective date of P.L.2009,
c.106 (C.52:27D-122.2 et al.), and thereafter at three-year intervals.  In
developing the energy price projections, the institution of higher education
shall consult with the Board of Public Utilities.  The commissioner shall be
authorized to amend the energy subcode to establish enhanced energy
conservation construction requirements, the added cost of each of which may
reasonably be recovered through energy conservation over a period of not more
than seven years.  Such requirements shall include provisions to ensure that,
in all parts of the State the anticipated energy savings shall be similarly
proportionate to the additional costs of energy subcode compliance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the edition of a model code or standard in effect
as a subcode as of July 1, 1995 shall continue in effect regardless of any
publication of a subsequent edition of that model code or standard.  Prior to
establishing the effective date for any subsequent revision or amendment of any
model code or standard adopted as a subcode, the commissioner shall review, in
consultation with the code advisory board, the text of the revised or amended
model code or standard and determine whether the amended or revised provisions
of the model code are essential to carry out the intent and purpose of
P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.) as viewed in contrast to the
corresponding provisions of the subcode then currently in effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In the event that the
commissioner, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, determines that any
amended or revised provision of a model code is essential to carry out the
intent and purpose of this act as viewed in contrast to any corresponding
provision of the subcode then currently in effect, the commissioner may then
adopt that provision of the amended or revised model code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The commissioner, in
consultation with the code advisory board, shall have the authority to review
any model code or standard currently in effect as a subcode of the State
Uniform Construction Code and compare it with previously adopted editions of
the same model code or standard in order to determine if the subcode currently
in effect is at least as consistent with the intent and purpose of this act as
were previously adopted editions of the same model code or standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   In the event that the
commissioner, after consultation with the code advisory board, determines
pursuant to this subsection that a provision of a model code or standard
currently in effect as a subcode of the State Uniform Construction Code is less
consistent with the intent and purpose of P.L.1975, c.217
(C.52:27D-119&nbsp;et&nbsp;seq.)&nbsp;than was the corresponding provision of a
previously adopted edition of the same model code or standard, the commissioner
may delete the provision in effect and substitute in its place the
corresponding provision of the previously adopted edition of the same model
code or standard determined to be more consistent with the intent and purpose
of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   The commissioner shall
be authorized to adopt a barrier free subcode or to supplement or revise any
model code adopted hereunder, for the purpose of insuring that adequate and
sufficient features are available in buildings or structures so as to make them
accessible to and usable by persons with physical disabilities.  Multi-family
residential buildings with four or more dwelling units in a single structure
shall be constructed in accordance with the barrier free subcode; for the
purposes of this subsection the term &quot;multi-family residential buildings
with four or more dwelling units in a single structure&quot; shall not include
buildings constructed as townhouses, which are single dwelling units with two
or more stories of living space, exclusive of basement or attic, with most or
all of the sleeping areas on one story and with most of the remaining habitable
space, such as kitchen, living, and dining areas, on another story, and with an
independent entrance at or near grade level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Any municipality
through its construction official, and any State agency or political
subdivision of the State, may submit an application recommending to the
commissioner that a State sponsored code change proposal be adopted.  Such
application shall contain such technical justification and shall be submitted
in accordance with such rules of procedure as the commissioner may deem
appropriate, except that whenever the State Board of Education shall determine
that enhancements to the code are essential to the maintenance of a thorough
and efficient system of education, the enhancements shall be made part of the
code; provided that the amendments do not result in standards that fall below
the adopted subcodes.  The Commissioner of Education shall consult with the
Commissioner of Community Affairs prior to publishing the intent of the State
Board to adopt any amendments to the Uniform Construction Code. Upon adoption
of any amendments by the State Board of Education they shall be transmitted
forthwith to the Commissioner of Community Affairs who shall publish and
incorporate the amendments as part of the Uniform Construction Code and the
amendments shall be enforceable as if they had been adopted by the
commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At least 45 days prior to the
final date for the submission of amendments or code change proposals to the
National Model Code Adoption Agency, the code of which has been adopted as a
subcode under P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), the commissioner shall
hold a public hearing in accordance with the &quot;Administrative Procedure
Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), at which testimony on any
application recommending a State sponsored code change proposal will be heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner shall
maintain a file of such applications, which shall be made available to the
public upon request and upon payment of a fee to cover the cost of copying and
mailing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After public hearing, the code
advisory board shall review any such applications and testimony and shall
within 20 days of such hearing present its own recommendations to the
commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner may adopt,
reject, or return such recommendations to the code advisory board for further
deliberation.  If adopted, any such proposal shall be presented to the subsequent
meeting of the National Model Code Agency by the commissioner or by persons
designated by the commissioner as a State sponsored code change proposal. 
Nothing herein, however, shall limit the right of any municipality, the
department, or any other person from presenting amendments to the National
Model Code Agency on its own initiative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner may adopt
further rules and regulations pursuant to this subsection and may modify the
procedures herein described when a model code change hearing has been scheduled
so as not to permit adequate time to meet such procedures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    This act shall take
effect immediately, but shall remain inoperative until January 1, 2025, except
that the Commissioner of Community Affairs, the Department of Environmental
Protection, and the Board of Public Utilities, shall take any anticipatory
administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish the
Zero Energy Construction Act, which would, beginning on January 1, 2025, require
all new residential and commercial developments to be zero energy ready and
require developers to offer zero energy construction to prospective owners.  Zero
energy buildings consume only as much energy as can be produced onsite through renewable
resources, and zero energy ready buildings are buildings capable of reaching
this level of energy consumption with the addition of renewable resources. 
Requiring new developments to be constructed as zero energy ready will reduce
both the consumption of energy that contributes to climate change as well as
the long-term energy costs of home and business owners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
Commissioner of Community Affairs, in consultation with the Department of
Environmental Protection and the Board of Public Utilities, to compile, and make
available on the Internet website of the Department of Community Affairs,
information for prospective owners and developers concerning the environmental
benefits of, and potential energy cost savings associated with, zero energy
buildings, and any applicable credits, rebates, or other incentives that may be
available to the prospective owner for purchasing a zero energy building.  The
bill also requires the Commissioner of Community Affairs, in consultation with
the Department of Environmental Protection and the Board of Public Utilities,
to adopt rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the purposes of the bill
and to revise the State Uniform Construction Code and the energy subcode accordingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     While the construction
requirements of the bill would be inoperative until January 1, 2025, the bill
authorizes the Commissioner of Community Affairs, the Department of Environmental
Protection, and the Board of Public Utilities, to take any anticipatory
administrative action in advance as is necessary for the implementation of the
bill.</p>
