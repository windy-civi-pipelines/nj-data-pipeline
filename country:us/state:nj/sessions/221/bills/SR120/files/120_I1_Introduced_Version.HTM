SR120 SENATE RESOLUTION No. 120 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JANUARY 14, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  ANTHONY M. BUCCO District 25 (Morris and Passaic) Senator  KRISTIN M. CORRADO District 40 (Bergen, Essex and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Urges President and Congress to enact certain legislation regarding drones. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Senate Resolution urging the President of the United States and Congress to enact proposed legislation regarding unmanned aircraft systems. Whereas, Every evening since November 18, 2024, thousands of residents of New Jersey have reported sighting small unmanned aircraft over several counties and several sensitive locations, including Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, Naval Weapons Station Earle in Monmouth County, the States largest reservoir, Round Valley in Hunterdon County, and a residence of the President-elect, Trump National Golf Club in Somerset County; and Whereas, during this same period, nighttime incursions by small unmanned aircraft, also known as drones, appeared at several United States military bases in England; and Whereas, the frequency, locations, and ongoing nature of these sightings have alarmed our States residents and generated a federal investigation; and Whereas, While the Federal Aviation Administration (F.A.A.) relies on State and local law enforcement agencies to observe and report to federal authorities suspicious or unlawful activity in airspace, federal aviation statutes do not authorize the F.A.A. to delegate its formal enforcement functions to state or local governments; and Whereas, It is proper and fitting for the people of New Jersey to urge Congress to advance Senate Bill No. 157, The Drone Act of 2023, which creates a federal statutory framework to criminalize various conduct involving the misuse of drones; and Whereas, It is proper and fitting for the people of New Jersey to urge Congress to advance Senate Bill No. 896, The SHIELD U Act, which authorizes and expands counter-unmanned aerial vehicle activity, or counter-drone activity, by state, local, and airport law enforcement and federal agencies; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The President of the United States and Congress are urged to enact The Drone Act of 2023, to create a federal statutory framework which criminalizes the misuse of drones and The SHIELD U Act to authorize and expand counter-drone activity by state, local, and airport law enforcement and federal agencies. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Senate Secretary to the President of the United States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and every member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution urges the President of the United States and Congress to enact S. 157 and S. 896. New Jersey has recently been inundated with activity by unmanned aircraft systems, or drones.  This activity occurs primarily between dusk and dawn, and per thousands of reports, is conducted by craft larger than any hobbyist is permitted to own.  The timing of these sightings coincide with sightings occurring at United States military bases in England.  The sightings in New Jersey have been troubling to residents as many have occurred over sensitive locations such as military installations, the Round Valley Reservoir, and a residence of the President-elect. Due to the supremacy of the Federal Aviation Administration (F.A.A.) over State and local law, and the inability of the F.A.A. to delegate formal enforcement functions to State and local governments, New Jerseys law enforcement are extremely limited in their ability to investigate and respond to this increasingly disturbing phenomenon; nor are they able to provide an informed response to alarmed residents. The resolution respectfully urges the President and Congress to enact The Drone Act of 2023, or S. 157, which creates a federal statutory framework to criminalize various conduct involving the misuse of drones and The SHIELD U Act, or  S. 896, which authorizes and expands counter-drone activities by state, local and airport law enforcement and federal agencies.
