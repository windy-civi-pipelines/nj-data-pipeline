This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) to create a list of individuals who are indefinitely excused from jury duty due to a developmental disability. The AOC is required to develop and maintain a list and eligibility guidelines for persons to be indefinitely excused from jury service due to a developmental disability.  Developmental disability is defined in the bill as a severe, chronic disability of a person which: (1)   is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental or physical impairments; (2)   manifests before age 22; (3)   is likely to continue indefinitely; (4)   results in substantial function limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activity, that is, self-care, receptive and expressive language, learning, mobility, self-direction and capacity for independent living or economic self-sufficiency; and (5) reflects the need for a combination and sequence of special inter-disciplinary or generic care, treatment or other services which are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated. Developmental disability also includes severe disabilities attributable to an intellectual disability, autism, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, spina bifada, and other neurological impairments where the criteria are met. The AOC is required to develop and publish on its internet website a form for persons seeking to be excused from jury service due to a developmental disability to complete as part of the information gathering process.  A person seeking to be excused from jury service is required to submit: (1) information, verified by a doctor of the person, indicating that the person meets the eligibility requirements; (2) information required by the form developed by the AOC; and (3) any other information deemed necessary by the AOC to make a proper determination. Currently, a person with a developmental disability, such as autism, is not automatically excused from jury duty.  To be excused from jury duty, a person would need to meet a requirement of N.J.S.A.2B:20-10, which does not include excusal for developmental disability.  Under the bill a person with a developmental disability may voluntarily be added to a list of persons who are automatically excused.
