by the bidder, it may vote to find the bidder lacking in responsibility and,
thus, disqualified.</p>

submission of a good faith application under oath, supported by documentary

relief, including reversal of a judgment or actual change of ownership, management,
or control of the bidder.</p>

Index for all urban consumers in New York and Northeastern New Jersey and the
Philadelphia areas, as reported by the United States Department of Labor.&nbsp;

&quot;New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act. The threshold for contracts through
which workers employed in the performance of the contract are paid in

for the provision of: banking, financial services, and e-commerce services;
services for maintenance and repair of building systems; and the purchase of
