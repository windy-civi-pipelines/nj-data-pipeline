Proper warning, as specified in the bill, is the posting of a warning notice on certain signs and contracts.  That warning notice would read:  WARNING:  Under New Jersey law, an agritourism host is not liable for the injury or death of a participant in an agritourism activity resulting from the inherent risk of the agritourism activity.  Inherent risks include without limitation the risk of animals, weather, land conditions, and the potential for you as a participant to act in a negligent way that may contribute to your own injury or death.  You are assuming the risk of participating in this agritourism activity.  Failure to follow the warning requirements would result in the agritourism hosts loss of limited liability protections. The limitation on liability also would not extend to any agritourism host who:  (1) commits an act or omission of gross negligence concerning the safety of a participant that proximately causes injury or death to the participant; (2) has actual knowledge of a dangerous condition on the land, facilities, or equipment used in the activity or the dangerous propensity of a particular animal used in the activity that proximately causes injury or death to the participant and does not make that danger known to the participant; (3) intentionally injures a participant; or (4) commits any other act, error, or omission that constitutes willful or wanton misconduct, gross negligence, or criminal conduct that proximately causes injury or death to the participant.  The limitation on liability provided by the bill would be in addition to any other limitation on liability provided by law, including, but not limited to, the limitations on liability for outdoor sports and recreational activities and equine animal activities. Finally, the bill would repeal P.L.1997, c.378 (C.2A:42A-9 et seq.) concerning farmer immunity for pick-your-own operations.  The protections in that law would be included in this bill, and are expanded to include agritourism activities generally.  This bill is modeled substantially on legislation from Arkansas.
