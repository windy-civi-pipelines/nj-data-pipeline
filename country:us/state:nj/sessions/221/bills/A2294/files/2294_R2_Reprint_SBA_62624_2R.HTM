"Mortgage servicer" means the same as that term is defined in section 2 of P.L.2019, c.65 (C.17:16F-28). "Remnants of Hurricane Ida" means the major storm that caused flooding in New Jersey on September 1 through 3 of 2021, for which notice of a Presidential declaration of a major disaster for New Jersey was issued on September 5, 2021. "Storm-impacted homeowner" means a mortgagor of title of a residential property who, as of August 31, 2021, occupied the property as the mortgagors primary residence, and who obtained federal disaster assistance for disaster-related needs as a result of damage sustained to the home due to the remnants of Hurricane Ida. 3.  a.  A mortgage servicer shall grant a mortgage forbearance to a storm-impacted homeowner if the storm-impacted homeowner submits a written request to the mortgage servicer, prior to the first day of the sixth month next following enactment of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), affirming the following: (1)  the storm-impacted homeowner has suffered a negative financial impact resulting from damage to the homeowners primary residence due to the remnants of Hurricane Ida, and has obtained federal disaster assistance as a result; (2)  the gross household income of the storm-impacted homeowner, for 2022, does not exceed 150 percent of the most recent area median income by zip code, as defined for New Jersey in guidelines published annually by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, unless this requirement for eligibility is waived by the mortgage lender; and (3)  if the storm-impacted homeowner possesses one or more bank accounts, those bank accounts collectively contain less than six months reserves of the storm-impacted homeowners gross household income for 2021.  The mortgage servicer may require the storm-impacted homeowner to provide a cash asset certification to demonstrate compliance with this paragraph. b.    Upon receipt of a written request or verbal authorization for a mortgage forbearance from a storm-impacted homeowner pursuant to subsection a. of this section, a mortgage servicer shall provide to the storm-impacted homeowner a mortgage forbearance and confirmation of that forbearance in writing.  No additional documentation shall be required from the storm-impacted homeowner by the mortgage servicer other than the written request under subsection a. of this section.  The mortgage forbearance period of a storm-impacted homeowner shall be one year.  Fees, penalties, or interest, including attorneys fees beyond the amounts scheduled and calculated as if the storm-impacted homeowner made all contractual payments on time and in full under the terms of the mortgage contract, shall not be assessed or accrue during or as a result of a mortgage forbearance granted pursuant to this section.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impact property tax and insurance obligations of an owner related to any real property in the State.  A mortgage servicer that grants a mortgage forbearance pursuant to this section shall encourage owners to seek out United States Department of Housing and Urban Development certified housing counseling and shall provide to the property owner confirmation of the approval of the forbearance, information concerning the process for forbearance, 2[and]2 information on how to request a subsequent forbearance 2, and information about other available relief programs2. c.     (1)  A mortgage servicer shall not furnish negative mortgage payment information to a debt collector or credit reporting agency related to mortgage payments subject to a mortgage forbearance under this section.

(2)  The mortgage servicer shall submit information on all forbearances that the mortgage servicer has provided within the State to the Department of Banking and Insurance on a monthly basis, or on any alternative schedule directed by the Department of Banking and Insurance, after removing all personally-identifiable information.  This information shall be submitted in accordance with any specifications required by the Department of Banking and Insurance, and, to the extent required by the Department of Banking and Insurance, shall be deemed to be government records and subject to the provisions of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), commonly known as the open public records act. h.    This section shall not apply to any mortgage loans made, insured, or securitized by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal Housing Administration of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Rural Housing Service, nor shall this section apply to any mortgage loans serviced pursuant to the policies of these entities but not made, or insured, or securitized by the entities 2unless the mortgage loan has been granted a forbearance under this section prior to being serviced by these entities2. i.     It shall be an unlawful discrimination in violation of the "New Jersey Law Against Discrimination," P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) for a mortgage servicer to discriminate in application of the provisions of this section on any basis protected by subsection g. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12). j.     This section shall not be construed to prohibit a mortgage servicer from considering an oral or electronic request for a mortgage forbearance instead of a written request submitted pursuant to subsection a. of this section. 4.  A storm-impacted homeowner who is the subject of a foreclosure proceeding shall be awarded, by the court and upon application by the property owner, a stay in the foreclosure proceedings if the conditions necessary to obtain a mortgage forbearance are satisfied, as established pursuant to subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  An application to the court by a storm-impacted homeowner pursuant to this section shall be made prior to the first day of the sixth month next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), unless the courts in their discretion permit application submission for a longer period.  The award of a stay pursuant to this section shall conclude upon the earlier of: a.  the conclusion of one year following the initial award of a stay of foreclosure proceedings; or b.  1[July] January1 1, 1[2024] 20261. 5.  This act shall take effect immediately, and shall apply retroactively to mortgage payments missed subsequent to September 1, 2021.
