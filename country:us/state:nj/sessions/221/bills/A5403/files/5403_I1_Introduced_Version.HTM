c.32 (C.4:1C-31) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     24.  a.  Any landowner
applying to the board to sell a development easement pursuant to section 17 of
P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-24) shall offer to sell the development easement at a
price which, in the opinion of the landowner, represents a fair value of the
development potential of the land for nonagricultural purposes, as determined
in accordance with the provisions of P.L.1983, c.32 <u>(C.4:1C-11 et al.)</u>.</p>

appraisals shall determine the current overall value of the parcel for
nonagricultural purposes, as well as the current market value of the parcel for
agricultural purposes<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>.
