Energy Planning and Conservation and shall be signed by said director and by
the commissioner.  In the event that such report is not prepared and
transmitted to the State instrumentality with power of approval over such
application within 90 days after the department's receipt of such application,
such State instrumentality shall act upon such application pursuant to the law
providing its power of approval thereof. In the event that the views of the
department, as contained in its report, with respect to any such application
differ from the views of the State instrumentality with the power of approval
over such application, there shall be established an Energy Facility Review
Board which shall consist of the Director of the Division of Energy Planning
and Conservation, the director or chief executive officer of the State
instrumentality with the power of approval over such application, and a
designee of the Governor.  The decision of the Energy Facility Review Board
created with respect to a specific energy facility application shall be binding
with respect to such facility and shall be implemented forthwith by the State
instrumentality with the power of approval over such application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In implementing its
responsibilities pursuant to this subsection, the department shall have the
power to adopt, by regulation, a fee schedule for reviewing applications for
the construction or location of energy facilities; provided, however, that fees
shall be charged to applicants for permits to construct or locate energy
facilities only in those instances where the nature and extent of the proposed
energy facility are such as to necessitate the employment of consultants or
other expert personnel from without the department before the department can make
its determination with respect to any such  application, and that such fees
shall in any event be the minimum amount necessary to permit the department to
fulfill its responsibilities under this section.<b><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
Energy Facilities Siting Commission (Commission), in but not of the Department
of the Treasury.  The purpose of the commission is to prepare and publish to
its Internet website criteria for the siting of new or expanded energy
facilities; propose and adopt site designations for the number, location, and
type of new or expanded energy facilities needed in the State; deny or grant
applications to construct energy facilities at designated sites and promote
energy production in New Jersey by minimizing the amount of restrictions placed
on where energy facilities can be located throughout the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission will consist of
five members, with at least one member that resides in each of the northern,
central, and southern regions of the State.  Three will be experts in the
energy industry, one will have experience in engineering, and one will have
experience in commercial land use and planning.  The bill authorizes the
commission, amongst other things, to:<span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
150%;letter-spacing:0pt'> </span>hold public meetings or hearings within this
State on any matter related to the location and operation of an energy
facility; to adopt rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions
of the bill; and to authorize energy facilities to be constructed and operated
in a manner that is exempt from State and local land-use regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
commission, within one year of the effective date of the bill, to prepare and publish
to its Internet website criteria for the siting of new energy facilities.  The
bill directs the commission to design the criteria to promote energy production
throughout the State by reducing the limitations on where energy facilities are
sited.  The bill directs the commission, by various dates established in the
bill, to: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) prepare and make available
to all interested persons preliminary criteria for the siting of new energy
facilities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) conduct public meetings on
the preliminary criteria in the several geographic areas of the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) consider and evaluate any
comments made at the public meetings, make revisions to the preliminary
criteria as it deems necessary or appropriate, and schedule a public hearing on
the revised criteria and hold public hearing on the revised criteria;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) evaluate comments made at
the public hearing, make such changes to the revised criteria as it deems
necessary or appropriate, and adopt and publish to its Internet website final
criteria for the siting of new energy facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill directs
the commission to propose and adopt site designations for the location, number
and type of new energy facilities.  The bill outlines the process by which
sites are to be proposed and adopted and guidelines for how the commission will
determine suitable proposed sites.  Under the bill, all new or expanded energy
facilities cannot commence construction without site certification.  The
commission is to review all applications for site certification which will be
prescribed by commission.  The bill establishes the review process by which all
applications for site certification are to occur.  Furthermore, the bill allows
for the commission to construct and operate an energy facility at a site
designated by the commission, in the event there are no applications for site
construction by a private owner or operator of an energy facility. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill exempts construction
and operation of the facility on a site designated by the commission from all
State and local land-use laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations.  The bill allows
an owner or operator of an energy facility which has received site
certification to construct and operate that facility without regard to any
local zoning ordinance or approval of a local zoning board.  Under the bill,
the commission may designate additional or alternative sites by request of
anyone in the energy industry and at the request of an affected municipality or
on its own, repeal or withdraw any adopted site for a new energy facility.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill is to supersede and
preempt any municipal or county rule, regulation, code, or ordinance concerning
the regulation of siting energy facilities.  The bill allows the commission to
adopt rules and regulations as may be necessary for the performance of their
respective responsibilities.  Under the bill, the owner or operator of an
energy facility located at a site which was adopted by the commission pursuant
this bill is be eligible for any applicable State funding or grant programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill amends State
law regarding the siting of any energy facility in any part of New Jersey to
reflect the boards control over siting along with the process of siting energy
facilities as established by this bill. </p>
