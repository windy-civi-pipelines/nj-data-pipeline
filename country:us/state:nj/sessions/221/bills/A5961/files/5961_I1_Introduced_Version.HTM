<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.  A prosecutor seeking
waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case by the Superior Court,
Chancery Division, Family Part to an appropriate court and prosecuting
authority without the consent of the juvenile shall file a motion within 60
days after the receipt of the complaint, which time may be extended for good
cause shown.  The motion shall be accompanied by a written statement of reasons
clearly setting forth the facts used in assessing all factors contained in
paragraph (3) of subsection c. of this section, together with an explanation as
to how evaluation of those facts support waiver for each particular juvenile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    At a hearing, the court
shall receive the evidence offered by the State and by the juvenile.  The State
shall provide proof to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) and
(2) of subsection c. of this section.  The court also shall review whether the
State considered the factors set forth in paragraph (3) of subsection c. of
this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Except as provided in
paragraph (3) of this subsection, the court shall waive jurisdiction of a
juvenile delinquency case without the juveniles consent and shall refer the
case to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority having jurisdiction if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  The juvenile was 15 years
of age or older at the time of the alleged delinquent act; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  There is probable cause
to believe that the juvenile committed a delinquent act which if committed by
an adult would constitute:</p>

than death by auto;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  strict liability for

when the juvenile previously had been sentenced and confined in an adult
correctional facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  The court may deny a
motion by the prosecutor to waive jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case
if it is clearly convinced that the prosecutor abused his discretion in
considering the following factors in deciding whether to seek a waiver:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  The nature and
circumstances of the offense charged;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  Whether the offense was
against a person or property, allocating more weight for crimes against the
person;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, which is designated
as Westons Law, extends the crime of human trafficking, N.J.S.A.2C:13-8, to
include the recruiting or coercing of juveniles to join or serve a criminal
gang or drug trafficking scheme.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, which
encompasses both labor and sex trafficking, human trafficking occurs when a
person knowingly holds, recruits, lures, entices, harbors, transports,
provides, or obtains another person, regardless of age, by any means, to engage
in sexual activity or to provide other labor or services, using methods that
include, among other things, acts that would constitute criminal coercion,
under N.J.S.A.2C:13-5, or providing the victim with access to controlled
dangerous substances (CDS).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Human trafficking of a minor
occurs when a person knowingly holds, recruits, lures, entices, harbors,
transports, provides, or obtains a minor by any means to engage in sexual
activity using any method, whether or not the trafficker mistakenly believes
that the victim is 18 years of age or older.  In addition to any other legal
remedy which may be awarded by law, under N.J.S.A.2C:13-8 and
N.J.S.A.2C:13-8.1, a victim of human trafficking may be awarded civil damages
and restitution in an amount equivalent to the value of the victims labor or
services, plus other appropriate relief by the court.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Human trafficking is also
defined as a type of racketeering activity under the States organized crime
statutes, N.J.S.A.2C:41-1 et seq. (also known as the State RICO law).  The
State RICO law allows the court to award triple damages to victims of
racketeering activity who bring a civil suit against a person convicted of
racketeering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the existing law
concerning the use of juveniles to commit crimes, N.J.S.A.2C:24-9, it is a
crime for a person 18 years of age or older to knowingly use, solicit, direct,
hire, employ, or conspire with a person 17 years of age or younger to commit any
crime, whether or not the adult mistakenly believed that the minor was at least
18 years of age.  Additionally, under subsection d. of N.J.S.A.2C:33-28, it is
a crime for a person to solicit, recruit, coerce, or threaten a person under 18
years of age to join or actively participate in a criminal street gang. 
Further, under N.J.S.A.2C:35-6, it is a crime for a person 18 years of age or
older to knowingly use, solicit, direct, hire, or employ a person 17 years of
age or younger in the operation of an illegal drug production facility, or in
the unlawful manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing of CDS, or to possess
CDS with intent to distribute.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, human
trafficking with respect to labor or services is defined to include, but not be
limited to, labor or services for a criminal street gang or in furtherance of
racketeering activity.  Human trafficking of a minor is defined to include, but
not be limited to, using a minor to commit a crime in violation of
N.J.S.A.2C:24-9, to participate in a criminal street gang in violation of
N.J.S.A.2C:33-28, or to participate in a drug distribution scheme in violation
of N.J.S.A.2C:35-6.  The definition of criminal street gang is amended to
include human trafficking as a type of gang related activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to criminal
coercion, the bill adds other prohibited methods of inducing a victim into
trafficking to include stalking (N.J.S.A.2C:12-10), invasion of privacy
(N.J.S.A.2C:14-9), sexual extortion (N.J.S.A.2C:14-9.1), and theft by extortion
(N.J.S.A.2C:20-5).  The bill further amends the criminal coercion statute to
expand coercive threats to include not only threats to a persons health,
safety, business, calling, career, financial condition, reputation, or personal
relationships, but also threats to a persons education, employment, or child
custody.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also clarifies that a
conviction for human trafficking will not merge, for sentencing purposes, with
a conviction for employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme.  Finally,
the bill amends the civil damages provision of the State RICO law to clarify
that persons damaged in their business or property by racketeering activity,
who are entitled to sue a person convicted of racketeering, includes victims of
human trafficking if the racketeering activity involved human trafficking.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill adds human
trafficking to the list of crimes for which a prosecutor may seek to waive a
juvenile up from the Family Court to adult criminal court to be tried as an
adult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Through the application of
human trafficking law under the bill, it is the sponsors intent to provide
additional law enforcement tools to combat the exploitation of minors by the
organized illegal drug trade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is named in honor of
Weston Fundner, who died in 2022 at the age of 15, from a fentanyl overdose
after he was stalked by another teenager who was involved in the illegal drug
trade, and coerced into accepting and ingesting a fentanyl pill.</p>
