(3)  The court may deny a motion by the prosecutor to waive jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case if it is clearly convinced that the prosecutor abused his discretion in considering the following factors in deciding whether to seek a waiver: (a)  The nature and circumstances of the offense charged; (b)  Whether the offense was against a person or property, allocating more weight for crimes against the person; (c)  Degree of the juveniles culpability; (d)  Age and maturity of the juvenile; (e)  Any classification that the juvenile is eligible for special education to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the juvenile or by the court; (f)  Degree of criminal sophistication exhibited by the juvenile; (g)  Nature and extent of any prior history of delinquency of the juvenile and dispositions imposed for those adjudications; (h)  If the juvenile previously served a custodial disposition in a State juvenile facility operated by the Youth Justice Commission, and the response of the juvenile to the programs provided at the facility to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the Youth Justice Commission; (i)  Current or prior involvement of the juvenile with child welfare agencies; (j)  Evidence of mental health concerns, substance use disorder, or emotional instability of the juvenile to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the juvenile or by the court; and (k)  If there is an identifiable victim, the input of the victim or victim's family. The Attorney General may develop for dissemination to the county prosecutors those guidelines or directives deemed necessary or appropriate to ensure the uniform application of this section throughout the State. d.    An order waiving jurisdiction over a case and referring the case to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority shall specify the alleged act upon which the referral is based and all other delinquent acts charged against the juvenile arising out of or related to the same transaction. e.     Testimony of a juvenile at a hearing to determine referral under this section shall not be admissible for any purpose in any subsequent hearing to determine delinquency or guilt of any offense. f.     Upon waiver of jurisdiction and referral to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority having jurisdiction: (1)  The case shall proceed as if it originated in that court and shall be subject to the sentencing provisions available to that court; provided, however, upon conviction for any offense which is subject to waiver pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection c. of this section, there shall be a presumption that the juvenile shall serve any custodial sentence imposed in a State juvenile facility operated by the Youth Justice Commission until the juvenile reaches the age of 21, except that: (a)  a juvenile who has not reached the age of 21 may, in the discretion of the Youth Justice Commission, be transferred to the Department of Corrections in accordance with the plan established pursuant to subsection e. of section 7 of P.L.1995, c.284 (C.52:17B-175) and regulations adopted pursuant to that section; and (b) a juvenile who has reached or exceeds the age of 21 may continue to serve a sentence in a State juvenile facility operated by the Youth Justice Commission in the discretion of the Youth Justice Commission and if the juvenile so consents; otherwise the juvenile shall serve the remainder of the custodial sentence in a State correctional facility; (2) If a juvenile is not convicted of an offense set forth in paragraph (2) of subsection c. of this section, a conviction for any other offense shall be deemed a juvenile adjudication and be remanded to the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part for disposition, in accordance with the dispositional options available to that court and all records related to the act of delinquency shall be subject to the provisions of section 1 of P.L.1982, c.79 (C.2A:4A-60); (3)  With the consent of the defense and the prosecutor, at any point in the proceedings subsequent to the decision ordering waiver the court may remand to the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part if it appears that: (a)  the interests of the public and the best interests of the juvenile require access to programs or procedures uniquely available to that court; and (b)  the interests of the public are no longer served by waiver. g.    (1) The Youth Justice Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall establish a program to collect, record, and analyze data regarding waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case by the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part to an appropriate court and prosecuting authority.  In furtherance of this program, the Youth Justice Commission shall, in cooperation with the Administrative Office of the Courts, Attorney General, and county prosecutors, collect data related to the decision to seek waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case, which shall include but not be limited to data concerning: (a)  youth demographics, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity; (b)  case characteristics, including the degree of the offense waived, the degree of the offense convicted, and the final court resolution; (c)  case processing times; and (d)  waiver rates by race and ethnicity. (2)  The commission shall prepare and publish on its Internet website biennial reports summarizing the data collected, recorded, and analyzed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. (3)  The commission shall, pursuant to section 2 of P.L. 1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), biennially prepare and transmit to the Governor and the Legislature the reports required in paragraph (2) of this subsection, along with any recommendations the commission may have for legislation concerning waiver of jurisdiction of juvenile delinquency cases. (cf: P.L.2025, c.35, s.3) 2.  N.J.S.2C:13-5 is amended to read as follows: 2C:13-5.  Criminal Coercion. a.     Offense defined. A person is guilty of criminal coercion if, with purpose unlawfully to restrict anothers freedom of action to engage or refrain from engaging in conduct, he threatens to: (1)   Inflict bodily injury on anyone or commit any other offense, regardless of the immediacy of the threat; (2)   Accuse anyone of an offense; (3)   Expose any secret which would tend to subject any person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to impair his credit or business repute; (4)   Take or withhold action as an official, or cause an official to take or withhold action; (5)   Bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other collective action, except that such a threat shall not be deemed coercive when the restriction compelled is demanded in the course of negotiation for the benefit of the group in whose interest the actor acts; (6)   Testify or provide information or withhold testimony or information with respect to anothers legal claim or defense; or (7)   Perform any other act which would not in itself substantially benefit the actor but which is calculated to substantially harm another person with respect to his health, safety, business, calling, career, financial condition, reputation, education, employment, child custody, or personal or family relationships. It is an affirmative defense to prosecution based on paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (6) and (7) that the actor believed the accusation or secret to be true or the proposed official action justified and that his purpose was limited to compelling the other to behave in a way reasonably related to the circumstances which were the subject of the accusation, exposure or proposed official action, as by desisting from further misbehavior, making good a wrong done, or refraining from taking any action or responsibility for which the actor believes the other disqualified. b.    Grading. Criminal coercion is a crime of the fourth degree unless the threat is to commit a crime more serious than one of the fourth degree or the actors purpose is criminal, in which cases the offense is a crime of the third degree. (cf: P.L.2015, c.98, s.3) 3.  Section 1 of P.L.2005, c.77 (C.2C:13-8) is amended to read as follows: 1.    Human trafficking. a.

(cf: P.L.2013, c.51, s.3) 4.  Section 1 of P.L.2007, c.341 (C.2C:33-29) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a.  A person is guilty of the crime of gang criminality if, while knowingly involved in criminal street gang activity, he commits, attempts to commit, or conspires to commit, whether as a principal or an accomplice, any crime specified in chapters 11 through 18, 20, 33, 35 or 37 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes; N.J.S.2C:34-1; N.J.S.2C:39-3; N.J.S.2C:39-4; section 1 of P.L.1998, c.26 (C.2C:39-4.1); N.J.S.2C:39-5; or N.J.S.2C:39-9.  A crime is committed while involved in a criminal street gang related activity if the crime was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang. Criminal street gang means three or more persons associated in fact.  Individuals are associated in fact if: (1) two of the following seven criteria that indicate criminal street gang membership apply: (a) self-proclamation; (b) witness testimony or official statement; (c) written or electronic correspondence; (d) paraphernalia or photographs; (e) tattoos; (f) clothing or colors; (g) any other indicia of street gang activity; and (2) individually or in combination with other members of a criminal street gang, while engaging in gang related activity, have committed or conspired or attempted to commit, within the preceding five years from the date of the present offense, excluding any period of imprisonment, one or more offenses on separate occasions of robbery, carjacking, aggravated assault, assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, arson, burglary, kidnapping, extortion, tampering with witnesses and informants, human trafficking, a violation of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.2013, c.51 (C.2C:13-9), or a violation of chapter 11, sections 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 of chapter 35, or chapter 39 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes. b.    Grading. Gang criminality is a crime of one degree higher than the most serious underlying crime referred to in subsection a. of this section, except that where the underlying crime is a crime of the first degree, gang criminality is a first degree crime and the defendant, upon conviction, and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, shall be sentenced to an ordinary term of imprisonment between 15 and 30 years.  A sentence imposed upon conviction of the crime of gang criminality shall be ordered to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed upon conviction of any underlying offense referred to in subsection a. of this section.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-3, the court may also impose a fine not to exceed $500,000.00 or five times the street value of the controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog involved, whichever is greater. It shall be no defense to a prosecution under this section that the actor mistakenly believed that the person which the actor used, solicited, directed, hired or employed was 18 years of age or older, even if such mistaken belief was reasonable. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude or limit a prosecution or conviction for a violation of any offense defined in this chapter pursuant to N.J.S.2C:2-6 or any other provision of law governing an actors liability for the conduct of another, and, notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.2C:1-8 or any other provision of law, a conviction arising under this section shall not merge with a conviction for a violation of N.J.S.2C:35-3 (leader of narcotics trafficking network), N.J.S.2C:35-4 (maintaining or operating a CDS production facility), N.J.S.2C:35-5 (manufacturing, distributing or dispensing), [or] N.J.S.2C:35-9 (strict liability for drug induced death), or section 1 of P.L.2005, c.77 (C.2C:13-8) (human trafficking).

The Superior Court, making due provision for the rights of innocent persons, shall have jurisdiction to prevent and restrain the acts or conduct which constitute violations of N.J.S. 2C:41-2, by issuing appropriate orders, including, but not limited to: (1)  Ordering any person to divest himself of any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise; (2)  Imposing reasonable restrictions on the future activities or investments  of any person, including but not limited to, prohibiting any person from  engaging in the same type of endeavor as the enterprise found to be in  violation of N.J.S. 2C:41-2; (3)  Ordering the dissolution or reorganization of any enterprise; (4)  Ordering the denial, suspension or revocation of the charter of any corporation organized under the laws of this State and to deny, suspend or revoke the license of any foreign corporation authorized to do business in the State of New Jersey; (5)  Ordering the denial, suspension or revocation of the license or permit granted to any enterprise by any department or agency of the State of New Jersey; (6)  Entering a cease and desist order which specifies the acts or conduct which is to be discontinued, altered or implemented by any person; (7)  Ordering the restitution of any moneys or property unlawfully obtained or retained by any person found to be in violation of N.J.S. 2C:41-2; (8)  Assessing civil monetary penalties against any person who has violated N.J.S. 2C:41-2 to deter future violations, provided that the court shall, upon making a finding on the record as to the gain any such person has acquired or maintained through the violation, assess such penalties in an amount not to exceed three times the amount of the gain; [and] (9)  Ordering any person to forfeit to the State any interest he has acquired or maintained in violation of this chapter and any interest in, security of, claim against, or property or contractual right of any kind affording a source of influence over any enterprises he has established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of this chapter.  Forfeiture under this subsection shall be in accordance with chapter 64 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.  The interest which shall be subject to forfeiture shall be as defined by this section and as defined by subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:64-1[a.]; or (10)  Imposing any or all of the foregoing sanctions in combination with each other. b. The Attorney General may institute proceedings in Superior Court for violations of N.J.S.2C:41-2.  In any action brought under this section, the court shall proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing and determination thereof.  Pending final determination thereof, the court may at any time enter restraining orders or prohibitions, or take other actions, including the acceptance of satisfactory performance bonds, as it shall deem proper. c. Any person damaged in his business or property by reason of a violation of N.J.S.2C:41-2, including but not limited to a victim of human trafficking if the violation of N.J.S.2C:41-2 involved a violation of section 1 of P.L.2005, c.77 (C.2C:13-8), may sue therefor in any appropriate court and shall recover threefold any damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorneys fee, costs of investigation and litigation. d. A final judgment rendered in favor of the State in any criminal proceeding brought under this chapter shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense in any subsequent civil proceeding. (cf: P.L.1981, c.167, s.2) 7.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, which is designated as Westons Law, extends the crime of human trafficking, N.J.S.A.2C:13-8, to include the recruiting or coercing of juveniles to join or serve a criminal gang or drug trafficking scheme. Under current law, which encompasses both labor and sex trafficking, human trafficking occurs when a person knowingly holds, recruits, lures, entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains another person, regardless of age, by any means, to engage in sexual activity or to provide other labor or services, using methods that include, among other things, acts that would constitute criminal coercion, under N.J.S.A.2C:13-5, or providing the victim with access to controlled dangerous substances (CDS). Human trafficking of a minor occurs when a person knowingly holds, recruits, lures, entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains a minor by any means to engage in sexual activity using any method, whether or not the trafficker mistakenly believes that the victim is 18 years of age or older.  In addition to any other legal remedy which may be awarded by law, under N.J.S.A.2C:13-8 and N.J.S.A.2C:13-8.1, a victim of human trafficking may be awarded civil damages and restitution in an amount equivalent to the value of the victims labor or services, plus other appropriate relief by the court. Human trafficking is also defined as a type of racketeering activity under the States organized crime statutes, N.J.S.A.2C:41-1 et seq. (also known as the State RICO law).  The State RICO law allows the court to award triple damages to victims of racketeering activity who bring a civil suit against a person convicted of racketeering. Under the existing law concerning the use of juveniles to commit crimes, N.J.S.A.2C:24-9, it is a crime for a person 18 years of age or older to knowingly use, solicit, direct, hire, employ, or conspire with a person 17 years of age or younger to commit any crime, whether or not the adult mistakenly believed that the minor was at least 18 years of age.  Additionally, under subsection d. of N.J.S.A.2C:33-28, it is a crime for a person to solicit, recruit, coerce, or threaten a person under 18 years of age to join or actively participate in a criminal street gang. Further, under N.J.S.A.2C:35-6, it is a crime for a person 18 years of age or older to knowingly use, solicit, direct, hire, or employ a person 17 years of age or younger in the operation of an illegal drug production facility, or in the unlawful manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing of CDS, or to possess CDS with intent to distribute. Under the bill, human trafficking with respect to labor or services is defined to include, but not be limited to, labor or services for a criminal street gang or in furtherance of racketeering activity.  Human trafficking of a minor is defined to include, but not be limited to, using a minor to commit a crime in violation of N.J.S.A.2C:24-9, to participate in a criminal street gang in violation of N.J.S.A.2C:33-28, or to participate in a drug distribution scheme in violation of N.J.S.A.2C:35-6.  The definition of criminal street gang is amended to include human trafficking as a type of gang related activity. In addition to criminal coercion, the bill adds other prohibited methods of inducing a victim into trafficking to include stalking (N.J.S.A.2C:12-10), invasion of privacy (N.J.S.A.2C:14-9), sexual extortion (N.J.S.A.2C:14-9.1), and theft by extortion (N.J.S.A.2C:20-5).  The bill further amends the criminal coercion statute to expand coercive threats to include not only threats to a persons health, safety, business, calling, career, financial condition, reputation, or personal relationships, but also threats to a persons education, employment, or child custody. The bill also clarifies that a conviction for human trafficking will not merge, for sentencing purposes, with a conviction for employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme.  Finally, the bill amends the civil damages provision of the State RICO law to clarify that persons damaged in their business or property by racketeering activity, who are entitled to sue a person convicted of racketeering, includes victims of human trafficking if the racketeering activity involved human trafficking. Finally, the bill adds human trafficking to the list of crimes for which a prosecutor may seek to waive a juvenile up from the Family Court to adult criminal court to be tried as an adult. Through the application of human trafficking law under the bill, it is the sponsors intent to provide additional law enforcement tools to combat the exploitation of minors by the organized illegal drug trade. This bill is named in honor of Weston Fundner, who died in 2022 at the age of 15, from a fentanyl overdose after he was stalked by another teenager who was involved in the illegal drug trade, and coerced into accepting and ingesting a fentanyl pill.

(3)  The court may deny a motion by the prosecutor to waive jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case if it is clearly convinced that the prosecutor abused his discretion in considering the following factors in deciding whether to seek a waiver: (a)  The nature and circumstances of the offense charged; (b)  Whether the offense was against a person or property, allocating more weight for crimes against the person; (c)  Degree of the juveniles culpability; (d)  Age and maturity of the juvenile; (e)  Any classification that the juvenile is eligible for special education to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the juvenile or by the court; (f)  Degree of criminal sophistication exhibited by the juvenile; (g)  Nature and extent of any prior history of delinquency of the juvenile and dispositions imposed for those adjudications; (h)  If the juvenile previously served a custodial disposition in a State juvenile facility operated by the Youth Justice Commission, and the response of the juvenile to the programs provided at the facility to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the Youth Justice Commission; (i)  Current or prior involvement of the juvenile with child welfare agencies; (j)  Evidence of mental health concerns, substance use disorder, or emotional instability of the juvenile to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the juvenile or by the court; and (k)  If there is an identifiable victim, the input of the victim or victim's family. The Attorney General may develop for dissemination to the county prosecutors those guidelines or directives deemed necessary or appropriate to ensure the uniform application of this section throughout the State. d.    An order waiving jurisdiction over a case and referring the case to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority shall specify the alleged act upon which the referral is based and all other delinquent acts charged against the juvenile arising out of or related to the same transaction. e.     Testimony of a juvenile at a hearing to determine referral under this section shall not be admissible for any purpose in any subsequent hearing to determine delinquency or guilt of any offense. f.     Upon waiver of jurisdiction and referral to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority having jurisdiction: (1)  The case shall proceed as if it originated in that court and shall be subject to the sentencing provisions available to that court; provided, however, upon conviction for any offense which is subject to waiver pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection c. of this section, there shall be a presumption that the juvenile shall serve any custodial sentence imposed in a State juvenile facility operated by the Youth Justice Commission until the juvenile reaches the age of 21, except that: (a)  a juvenile who has not reached the age of 21 may, in the discretion of the Youth Justice Commission, be transferred to the Department of Corrections in accordance with the plan established pursuant to subsection e. of section 7 of P.L.1995, c.284 (C.52:17B-175) and regulations adopted pursuant to that section; and (b) a juvenile who has reached or exceeds the age of 21 may continue to serve a sentence in a State juvenile facility operated by the Youth Justice Commission in the discretion of the Youth Justice Commission and if the juvenile so consents; otherwise the juvenile shall serve the remainder of the custodial sentence in a State correctional facility; (2) If a juvenile is not convicted of an offense set forth in paragraph (2) of subsection c. of this section, a conviction for any other offense shall be deemed a juvenile adjudication and be remanded to the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part for disposition, in accordance with the dispositional options available to that court and all records related to the act of delinquency shall be subject to the provisions of section 1 of P.L.1982, c.79 (C.2A:4A-60); (3)  With the consent of the defense and the prosecutor, at any point in the proceedings subsequent to the decision ordering waiver the court may remand to the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part if it appears that: (a)  the interests of the public and the best interests of the juvenile require access to programs or procedures uniquely available to that court; and (b)  the interests of the public are no longer served by waiver. g.    (1) The Youth Justice Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall establish a program to collect, record, and analyze data regarding waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case by the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part to an appropriate court and prosecuting authority.  In furtherance of this program, the Youth Justice Commission shall, in cooperation with the Administrative Office of the Courts, Attorney General, and county prosecutors, collect data related to the decision to seek waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case, which shall include but not be limited to data concerning: (a)  youth demographics, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity; (b)  case characteristics, including the degree of the offense waived, the degree of the offense convicted, and the final court resolution; (c)  case processing times; and (d)  waiver rates by race and ethnicity. (2)  The commission shall prepare and publish on its Internet website biennial reports summarizing the data collected, recorded, and analyzed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. (3)  The commission shall, pursuant to section 2 of P.L. 1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), biennially prepare and transmit to the Governor and the Legislature the reports required in paragraph (2) of this subsection, along with any recommendations the commission may have for legislation concerning waiver of jurisdiction of juvenile delinquency cases. (cf: P.L.2025, c.35, s.3) 2.  N.J.S.2C:13-5 is amended to read as follows: 2C:13-5.  Criminal Coercion. a.     Offense defined. A person is guilty of criminal coercion if, with purpose unlawfully to restrict anothers freedom of action to engage or refrain from engaging in conduct, he threatens to: (1)   Inflict bodily injury on anyone or commit any other offense, regardless of the immediacy of the threat; (2)   Accuse anyone of an offense; (3)   Expose any secret which would tend to subject any person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to impair his credit or business repute; (4)   Take or withhold action as an official, or cause an official to take or withhold action; (5)   Bring about or continue a strike, boycott or other collective action, except that such a threat shall not be deemed coercive when the restriction compelled is demanded in the course of negotiation for the benefit of the group in whose interest the actor acts; (6)   Testify or provide information or withhold testimony or information with respect to anothers legal claim or defense; or (7)   Perform any other act which would not in itself substantially benefit the actor but which is calculated to substantially harm another person with respect to his health, safety, business, calling, career, financial condition, reputation, education, employment, child custody, or personal or family relationships. It is an affirmative defense to prosecution based on paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (6) and (7) that the actor believed the accusation or secret to be true or the proposed official action justified and that his purpose was limited to compelling the other to behave in a way reasonably related to the circumstances which were the subject of the accusation, exposure or proposed official action, as by desisting from further misbehavior, making good a wrong done, or refraining from taking any action or responsibility for which the actor believes the other disqualified. b.    Grading. Criminal coercion is a crime of the fourth degree unless the threat is to commit a crime more serious than one of the fourth degree or the actors purpose is criminal, in which cases the offense is a crime of the third degree. (cf: P.L.2015, c.98, s.3) 3.  Section 1 of P.L.2005, c.77 (C.2C:13-8) is amended to read as follows: 1.    Human trafficking. a.

(cf: P.L.2013, c.51, s.3) 4.  Section 1 of P.L.2007, c.341 (C.2C:33-29) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a.  A person is guilty of the crime of gang criminality if, while knowingly involved in criminal street gang activity, he commits, attempts to commit, or conspires to commit, whether as a principal or an accomplice, any crime specified in chapters 11 through 18, 20, 33, 35 or 37 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes; N.J.S.2C:34-1; N.J.S.2C:39-3; N.J.S.2C:39-4; section 1 of P.L.1998, c.26 (C.2C:39-4.1); N.J.S.2C:39-5; or N.J.S.2C:39-9.  A crime is committed while involved in a criminal street gang related activity if the crime was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang. Criminal street gang means three or more persons associated in fact.  Individuals are associated in fact if: (1) two of the following seven criteria that indicate criminal street gang membership apply: (a) self-proclamation; (b) witness testimony or official statement; (c) written or electronic correspondence; (d) paraphernalia or photographs; (e) tattoos; (f) clothing or colors; (g) any other indicia of street gang activity; and (2) individually or in combination with other members of a criminal street gang, while engaging in gang related activity, have committed or conspired or attempted to commit, within the preceding five years from the date of the present offense, excluding any period of imprisonment, one or more offenses on separate occasions of robbery, carjacking, aggravated assault, assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, arson, burglary, kidnapping, extortion, tampering with witnesses and informants, human trafficking, a violation of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.2013, c.51 (C.2C:13-9), or a violation of chapter 11, sections 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 of chapter 35, or chapter 39 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes. b.    Grading.

STATEMENT This bill, which is designated as Westons Law, extends the crime of human trafficking, N.J.S.A.2C:13-8, to include the recruiting or coercing of juveniles to join or serve a criminal gang or drug trafficking scheme. Under current law, which encompasses both labor and sex trafficking, human trafficking occurs when a person knowingly holds, recruits, lures, entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains another person, regardless of age, by any means, to engage in sexual activity or to provide other labor or services, using methods that include, among other things, acts that would constitute criminal coercion, under N.J.S.A.2C:13-5, or providing the victim with access to controlled dangerous substances (CDS). Human trafficking of a minor occurs when a person knowingly holds, recruits, lures, entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains a minor by any means to engage in sexual activity using any method, whether or not the trafficker mistakenly believes that the victim is 18 years of age or older.  In addition to any other legal remedy which may be awarded by law, under N.J.S.A.2C:13-8 and N.J.S.A.2C:13-8.1, a victim of human trafficking may be awarded civil damages and restitution in an amount equivalent to the value of the victims labor or services, plus other appropriate relief by the court. Human trafficking is also defined as a type of racketeering activity under the States organized crime statutes, N.J.S.A.2C:41-1 et seq. (also known as the State RICO law).  The State RICO law allows the court to award triple damages to victims of racketeering activity who bring a civil suit against a person convicted of racketeering. Under the existing law concerning the use of juveniles to commit crimes, N.J.S.A.2C:24-9, it is a crime for a person 18 years of age or older to knowingly use, solicit, direct, hire, employ, or conspire with a person 17 years of age or younger to commit any crime, whether or not the adult mistakenly believed that the minor was at least 18 years of age.  Additionally, under subsection d. of N.J.S.A.2C:33-28, it is a crime for a person to solicit, recruit, coerce, or threaten a person under 18 years of age to join or actively participate in a criminal street gang. Further, under N.J.S.A.2C:35-6, it is a crime for a person 18 years of age or older to knowingly use, solicit, direct, hire, or employ a person 17 years of age or younger in the operation of an illegal drug production facility, or in the unlawful manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing of CDS, or to possess CDS with intent to distribute. Under the bill, human trafficking with respect to labor or services is defined to include, but not be limited to, labor or services for a criminal street gang or in furtherance of racketeering activity.  Human trafficking of a minor is defined to include, but not be limited to, using a minor to commit a crime in violation of N.J.S.A.2C:24-9, to participate in a criminal street gang in violation of N.J.S.A.2C:33-28, or to participate in a drug distribution scheme in violation of N.J.S.A.2C:35-6.  The definition of criminal street gang is amended to include human trafficking as a type of gang related activity. In addition to criminal coercion, the bill adds other prohibited methods of inducing a victim into trafficking to include stalking (N.J.S.A.2C:12-10), invasion of privacy (N.J.S.A.2C:14-9), sexual extortion (N.J.S.A.2C:14-9.1), and theft by extortion (N.J.S.A.2C:20-5).  The bill further amends the criminal coercion statute to expand coercive threats to include not only threats to a persons health, safety, business, calling, career, financial condition, reputation, or personal relationships, but also threats to a persons education, employment, or child custody. The bill also clarifies that a conviction for human trafficking will not merge, for sentencing purposes, with a conviction for employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme.  Finally, the bill amends the civil damages provision of the State RICO law to clarify that persons damaged in their business or property by racketeering activity, who are entitled to sue a person convicted of racketeering, includes victims of human trafficking if the racketeering activity involved human trafficking. Finally, the bill adds human trafficking to the list of crimes for which a prosecutor may seek to waive a juvenile up from the Family Court to adult criminal court to be tried as an adult. Through the application of human trafficking law under the bill, it is the sponsors intent to provide additional law enforcement tools to combat the exploitation of minors by the organized illegal drug trade. This bill is named in honor of Weston Fundner, who died in 2022 at the age of 15, from a fentanyl overdose after he was stalked by another teenager who was involved in the illegal drug trade, and coerced into accepting and ingesting a fentanyl pill.
