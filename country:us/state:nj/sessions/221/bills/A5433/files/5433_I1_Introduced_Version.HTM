<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 5 of P.L.1966,
c.113 (C.34:11-56a4) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    a.  Except as provided
in subsections c., d., e. g., and i. of this section, each employer shall pay
to each of his employees wages at a rate of not less than $8.85 per hour as of
January 1, 2019 and, on January 1 of 2020 and January 1 of each subsequent year,
the minimum wage shall be increased by any increase in the consumer price index
for all urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) as calculated by the
federal government for the 12 months prior to the September 30 preceding that
January 1, except that any of the following rates shall apply if it exceeds the
rate determined in accordance with the applicable increase in the CPI-W for the
indicated year: on July 1, 2019, the minimum wage shall be $10.00 per hour; on
January 1, 2020, the minimum wage shall be $11.00 per hour; and on January 1 of
each year from 2021 to 2024, inclusive, the minimum wage shall be increased
from the rate of the preceding year by $1.00 per hour.  If the federal minimum
hourly wage rate set by section 6 of the federal &quot;Fair Labor Standards Act
of 1938&quot; (29 U.S.C. s.206), or a successor federal law, is raised to a
level higher than the State minimum wage rate set by this subsection, then the
State minimum wage rate shall be increased to the level of the federal minimum
wage rate and subsequent increases based on increases in the CPI-W pursuant to
this section shall be applied to the higher minimum wage rate.  If an
applicable wage order has been issued by the commissioner under section 17
(C.34:11-56a16) of this act, the employer shall also pay not less than the
wages prescribed in said order.  The wage rates fixed in this section shall not
be applicable to persons under the age of 18 not possessing a special
vocational school graduate permit issued pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1940,
c.153 (C.34:2-21.15), or to persons employed as salesmen of motor vehicles, or
to persons employed as outside salesmen as such terms shall be defined and
delimited in regulations adopted by the commissioner, or to persons employed in
a volunteer capacity and receiving only incidental benefits at a county or
other agricultural fair by a nonprofit or religious corporation or a nonprofit
or religious association which conducts or participates in that fair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  An employer shall
also pay each employee not less than 1 1/2 times such employee's regular hourly
rate for each hour of working time in excess of 40 hours in any week, except
that this overtime rate shall not apply: to any individual employed in a bona
fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity; or to employees
engaged to labor on a farm or employed in a hotel; or to an employee of a
common carrier of passengers by motor bus; or to a limousine driver who is an
employee of an employer engaged in the business of operating limousines; or to
employees engaged in labor relative to the raising or care of livestock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Employees engaged on a
piece-rate or regular hourly rate basis to labor on a farm shall be paid for
each day worked not less than the applicable minimum hourly wage rate multiplied
by the total number of hours worked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Full-time students may
be employed by the college or university at which they are enrolled at not less
than 85% of the effective applicable minimum wage rate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Employees of a small
employer, and employees who are engaged in seasonal employment, except for
employees who customarily and regularly receive gratuities or tips who shall be
subject to the provisions of subsections a. and d. of this section, shall be
paid $8.85 per hour as of January 1, 2019 and, on January 1 of 2020 and January
1 of each subsequent year, that minimum wage rate shall be increased by any
increase in the consumer price index for all urban wage earners and clerical
workers (CPI-W) as calculated by the federal government for the 12 months prior
to the September 30 preceding that January 1, except that any of the following
rates shall apply if it exceeds the rate determined in accordance with the
applicable increase in the CPI-W for the indicated year: on January 1, 2020,
the minimum wage shall be $10.30 per hour; and on January 1 of each year from
2021 to 2025, inclusive, the minimum wage shall be increased from the rate of
the preceding year by eighty cents per hour, and, in 2026, the minimum wage
shall be increased from the rate of the preceding year by seventy cents per
hour, and, in each year from 2027 to 2028 inclusive, the minimum wage for
employees subject to this subsection c. shall be increased by the same amount
as the increase for employees subject to subsection a. of this section based on
CPI-W increases, plus one half of the difference between $15.00 per hour and
the minimum wage in effect in 2026 for employees pursuant to subsection a. of
this section, so that, by 2028, the minimum wage for employees subject to this
subsection shall be the same as the minimum wage in effect for employees
subject to subsection a. of this section.  If the federal minimum hourly wage
rate set by section 6 of the federal &quot;Fair Labor Standards Act of
1938&quot; (29 U.S.C. s.206), or a successor federal law, is raised to a level
higher than the State minimum wage rate set by this subsection, then the State
minimum wage rate shall be increased to the level of the federal minimum wage
rate and subsequent increases based on increases in the CPI-W pursuant to this
subsection shall be applied to the higher minimum wage rate.</p>

of Transportation may prescribe maximum hours of work for the safe operation of

the trucking industry shall be paid no less than the minimum wage rate as
provided in this section and N.J.A.C. 12:56-3.1.  As used in this section,
&quot;trucking industry employer&quot; means any business or establishment

2020, a training wage of not less than 90 percent of the minimum wage rate
otherwise set pursuant to subsection a. of this section may be paid to an
employee who is enrolled in an established employer on-the-job or other
training program which meets standards set by regulations adopted by the
commissioner.  The period during which an employer may pay the training wage to
the employee shall be the first 120 hours of work after hiring the employee in
employment in an occupation in which the employee has no previous similar or
related experience.  An employer shall not utilize any employee paid the
training wage in a manner which causes, induces, encourages or assists any
displacement or partial displacement of any currently employed worker,
including any previous recipient of the training wage, by reducing hours of a
currently employed worker, replacing a current or laid off employee with a
trainee, or by relocating operations resulting in a loss of employment at a
previous workplace, or in a manner which replaces, supplants, competes with or
duplicates any approved apprenticeship program.  An employer who pays an
employee a training wage shall make a good faith effort to continue to employ
the employee after the period of the training wage expires and shall not hire
the employee at the training wage unless there is a reasonable expectation that
there will be regular employment, paying at or above the effective minimum
wage, for the trainee upon the successful completion of the period of the
training wage.  If the commissioner determines that an employer has made
repeated, knowing violations of the provisions of this subsection regarding the
payment of a training wage, the commissioner shall suspend the employer's right
to pay a training wage for a period set pursuant to regulations adopted by the
commissioner, but not less than three years.</p>

a five-year period, reduces the current credit of $9.87 per hour to $7.90 per
hour in 2026, $5.92 per hour in 2027, $3.95 per hour in 2028, $1.97 per hour in
2029, and eliminating the credit in 2030 and all subsequent years, thus
providing tipped employees with the same cash minimum wage as other workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The current law allows an
employer of a tipped employee to count the tips received by the employee
towards compliance with minimum wage requirements.  The eventual elimination of
the tip credit by this bill will require that the employer pay the full amount
of the minimum wage without regard to any amount of tips received by the
employee.</p>
