As set forth in the current law (section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19)), domestic violence includes any of the following offenses: · Homicide    N.J.S.2C:11-1 et seq. · Assault    N.J.S.2C:12-1 · Terroristic threats  N.J.S.2C:12-3 · Kidnapping    N.J.S.2C:13-1 · Criminal restraint  N.J.S.2C:13-2 · False imprisonment  N.J.S.2C:13-3 · Sexual assault   N.J.S.2C:14-2 · Criminal sexual contact  N.J.S.2C:14-3 · Lewdness    N.J.S.2C:14-4 · Criminal mischief  N.J.S.2C:17-3 · Burglary    N.J.S.2C:18-2 · Criminal trespass  N.J.S.2C:18-3 · Harassment    N.J.S.2C:33-4 · Stalking    P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10) Thus, an adoptive parent who was subjected to one or more of these offenses by a person whose parental rights toward the adopted child were terminated could, as established by the bill, receive protections under the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991.
