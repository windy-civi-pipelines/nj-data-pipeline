In addition, federal funding is urgently needed to rebuild the decaying memorial homes.  The Vineland veteran memorial home was rebuilt and rededicated in 2005, while the Paramus and Menlo Park locations are decades old.  Our veterans and their families have sacrificed so much.  They should not have to suffer because of COVID-19 related shortages, or live in decaying buildings.
