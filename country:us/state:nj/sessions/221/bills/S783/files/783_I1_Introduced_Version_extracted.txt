"High contrast" means a light symbol on a solid dark background or a dark symbol on a solid light background and having at least 70 percent contrast between the symbol artwork and background using the formula [(B1 - B2) / B1] * 100, where B1 is the light reflectance value of the light background, and B2 is the light reflectance value of the dark background or symbol. "Label" means to represent by statement, word, picture, design, or emblem on a covered product package. "Label notice" means the phrase "Do Not Flush" in a size equal to at least two percent of the surface area of the principal display panel, except as otherwise specified in subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); provided, however, for covered products regulated pursuant to the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. s.1261 et seq.) by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission under 16 CFR s.100.121, if the label notice requirements in this paragraph would result in a type size larger than first aid instructions under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, then the type size for the label notice shall, to the extent permitted by federal law, be equal to or greater than the type size required for first aid instructions; and for a  covered product required to be registered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. s.136 et seq.) if the label notice requirements in this paragraph would result in a type size on the principal display panel larger than a warning pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, then the type size for the label notice shall, to the extent permitted by federal law, be equal to or greater than the type size required for a child hazard warning required by the Environmental Protection Agency. Non-flushable disposable wipe product means (1) a pre-moistened nonwoven disposable wipe marketed as a baby wipe or diapering wipe; or (2) a pre-moistened nonwoven disposable wipe that is composed partly or entirely of petrochemical-derived fibers which may reasonably be used in a bathroom and shall include, but not be limited to, baby wipes, bathroom cleaning wipes, toilet cleaning wipes, hard surface cleaning wipes, disinfecting wipes, hand sanitizing and other sanitizing wipes, antibacterial wipes, facial and makeup removal wipes, general purpose cleaning wipes, personal care wipes for use on the body, feminine hygiene wipes, adult incontinence wipes, adult hygiene wipes, and body cleansing wipes.

(7)   for covered products sold in bulk at retail, both the outer package visible at retail and the individual packages contained within shall comply with the labeling requirements set forth in this subsection that apply to the particular packaging types, except the following: (a)   individual packages contained within the outer package that are not intended to dispense individual wipes and contain no retail labeling; and (b)   outer packages that do not obscure the symbol and label notice on individual packages contained within; (8)   if a covered product is provided within the same packaging as another consumer product for use in combination with the other consumer product, the outside retail packaging of the other consumer product does not need to comply with the labeling requirements of this subsection; (9)   if a covered product is provided within the same package as another consumer product for use in combination with the other product and is in a package smaller than three inches by three inches, the covered entity of the covered product may comply with the requirements of this subsection by placing the symbol and label notice in a prominent location reasonably likely to be seen and read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions;

(11)  if a covered product is required to be registered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. s.136 et seq.) and the New Jersey Department of Agriculture under State law, then the covered entity shall submit a label compliant with the labeling requirements of this subsection no later than January 1, 2024, to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  If the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the New Jersey Department of Agriculture does not approve a product label that otherwise complies with the labeling requirements of this subsection, the covered entity shall use a label that complies with as many of the requirements of this subsection as the relevant agency has approved; and (12)  a covered entity may include on a covered product words or phrases in addition to those required for the label notice if the words or phrases are consistent with the purposes of this act. c.     The Department of Environmental Protection and the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety shall enforce the provisions of this section. d.    Nothing in this section shall apply to non-flushable disposable wipe products that are sold, offered for sale, or distributed by a retailer or wholesaler that does not package or label the non-flushable disposable wipe products. 3.    A covered entity who violates this act shall be subject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for each offense, to be collected in a civil action by summary proceeding pursuant to the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  If the violation is of a continuing nature, each day during which a non-flushable disposable wipe product is sold, offered for sale, or distributed in violation of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall constitute a separate offense.  The Superior Court and the municipal court, as appropriate, shall have jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999. 4.    The Department of Environmental Protection shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations necessary to implement this act. 5.    This act shall take effect two years after the date of enactment, but the Commissioner of Environmental Protection may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill requires non-flushable disposable wipes to be labeled, and prohibits the sale, offering for sale, or distribution for sale of these products without Do Not Flush labeling.  The bill defines a non-flushable disposable wipe product to mean (1) a pre-moistened nonwoven disposable wipe marketed as a baby wipe; or (2) a pre-moistened nonwoven disposable wipe that is composed partly or entirely of petrochemical-derived fibers which may reasonably be used in a bathroom and which are to include, but not be limited to, baby wipes, bathroom cleaning wipes, toilet cleaning wipes, hard surface cleaning wipes, disinfecting wipes, hand sanitizing  and other sanitizing wipes, antibacterial wipes, facial and makeup removal wipes, general purpose cleaning wipes, personal care wipes for use on the body, feminine hygiene wipes, adult incontinence wipes, adult hygiene wipes, and body cleansing wipes.  Any non-flushable disposable wipe product sold, offered for sale, or distributed for sale in this State would be required to have a Do Not Flush symbol and label notice on the product packaging in accordance with the provisions of this bill. The Department of Environmental Protection and the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety are to enforce the bills provisions.  The bill would not apply to media advertisements or retailers who sell non-flushable disposable wipe products that are not properly labeled. Violations of the bills provisions would be subject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for each offense.  Each day during which a nonwoven disposable product is sold, offered for sale, or distributed in violation of the bills provisions would constitute a separate offense.
