Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 3 of P.L.1961,
c.49 (C.52:14-17.27) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a. There is hereby
created a State Health Benefits Commission, consisting of five members: the State
Treasurer; the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance; the Chairperson of the
Civil Service Commission; a State employees' representative chosen by the
Public Employee Committee of the AFL-CIO; and the fifth member of the
commission shall be a local employees' representative chosen by the Public
Employee Committee of the AFL-CIO.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The treasurer shall be
chairman of the commission and the health benefits program authorized by
P.L.1961, c.49 shall be administered in the Treasury Department. The Director of
the Division of Pensions and Benefits shall be the secretary of the commission.
The commission and committee shall establish a health benefits program for the
employees of the State, the cost of which shall be paid as specified in section
6 of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.30). The commission, in consultation with the
committee, shall establish rules and regulations as may be deemed reasonable
and necessary for the administration of P.L.1961, c.49.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Attorney General shall be
the legal advisor of the commission and committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The members of the commission
and committee shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for any
necessary expenditures. The public employee members shall not suffer loss of
salary or wages during service on the commission or committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission shall publish
annually a report showing the fiscal transactions of the program for the
preceding year and stating other facts pertaining to the plan. The commission
shall submit the report to the Governor and furnish a copy to every employer
for use of the participants and the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The commission shall
publish annually a rate setting recommendation analysis report, prepared by an
actuarial firm, including an executive summary, the plan overview for the
upcoming year, a trend analysis, financial projections, rate setting
developments, and any exhibits to further support the findings of the report. 
The commission shall submit the report to the Governor and the Legislature in
accordance with section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), and the Division
of Pensions and Benefits shall post the report on its website for the public.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The commission shall
provide for a period after the report is released to the public during which
the public may submit comments.  The commission shall hold at least one public
hearing after the release of the report to the public to allow for input on the
rate setting recommendation analysis.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    There is established a
State Health Benefits Plan Design Committee, composed of 12 members as
follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     six members who shall be
appointed by the Governor as representatives of public employers whose
employees are enrolled in the program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     three members who shall be
appointed by the Public Employee Committee of the AFL-CIO;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     one member who shall be
appointed by the head of the union, that is not affiliated with the AFL-CIO,
that represents the greatest number of police officers in this State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     one member who shall be
appointed by the head of the union, that is not affiliated with the AFL-CIO,
that represents the greatest number of firefighters in this State; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     one member who shall be
appointed by the head of the State Troopers Fraternal Association. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The members of the committee
shall serve for a term of three years and until a successor is appointed and
qualified.  Of the initial appointments by the Governor, three members shall
serve for two years and until a successor is appointed and qualified, and two
shall serve for one year and until a successor is appointed and qualified.  Of
the initial appointment by the head of the union representing the greatest
number of police officers in the State, the member shall serve for two years
and until a successor is appointed and qualified.  Of the initial appointment
by the head of the union representing the greatest number of firefighters in
the State, the member shall serve for one year and until a successor is
appointed and qualified. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The members of the committee
shall select a chairperson from among the members, who shall serve for a term
of one year, with no member serving more than one term as chairperson until all
the members of the committee have served a term in a manner alternating among
the employer representatives and employee representatives, unless the committee
determines otherwise with regard to this process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The committee shall have the
responsibility for and authority over the various plans and components of those
plans, including for medical benefits, prescription benefits, dental, vision,
and any other health care benefits, offered and administered by the program. 
The committee shall have the authority to create, modify, or terminate any plan
or component, at its sole discretion.  Any reference in law to the State Health
Benefits Commission in the context of the creation, modification, or
termination of a plan or plan component shall be deemed to apply to the
committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The members of the committee
shall have the same duty and responsibility to the program as do the members of
the commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If any matter before the
committee receives at least seven votes in the affirmative, the commission
shall approve and implement the committee's decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If any matter before the
committee receives six votes in the affirmative and six votes in the negative
or the committee otherwise reaches an impasse on a decision, the provisions of
section 55 of P.L.2011, c.78 (C.52:14-17.27b) shall be followed.</p>
