<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section)  a.  The
commissioner shall establish standards for the maximum development costs per
unit that shall be permitted for a project developed with the assistance of
funding provided through the &quot;New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust
Fund&quot; established pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-320). 
The per-unit development cost standards established by the commissioner shall
be comparable to the maximum per-unit development cost standards administered

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The commissioner shall
adopt rules and regulations, in accordance with the &quot;Administrative
Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to implement the

c.222 (C.52:27D-320) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     20.  There is established in
the Department of Community Affairs a separate trust fund, to be used for the
exclusive purposes as provided in this section, and which shall be known as the
&quot;New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund.&quot;  The fund shall be a
non-lapsing, revolving trust fund, and all monies deposited or received for
purposes of the fund shall be accounted for separately, by source and amount,
and remain in the fund until appropriated for such purposes.  The fund shall be
the repository of all State funds appropriated for affordable housing purposes,
including, but not limited to, the proceeds from the receipts of the additional
fee collected pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 3 of
P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-7), proceeds from available receipts of the Statewide
non-residential development fees collected pursuant to section 35 of P.L.2008,
c.46 (C.40:55D-8.4), monies lapsing or reverting from municipal development
trust funds, or other monies as may be dedicated, earmarked, or appropriated by
the Legislature for the purposes of the fund.  All references in any law,
order, rule, regulation, contract, loan, document, or otherwise, to the
&quot;Neighborhood Preservation Nonlapsing Revolving Fund&quot; shall mean the
&quot;New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund.&quot;  The department shall be
permitted to utilize annually up to 7.5 percent of the monies available in the
fund for the payment of any necessary administrative costs related to the
administration of the &quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222
(C.52:27D-301 et al.), or any costs related to administration of P.L.2008, c.46
(C.52:27D-329.1 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  (1)  Except as permitted
pursuant to subsection g. of this section, and by section 41 of P.L.2009, c.90
(C.52:27D-320.1), the commissioner shall award grants or loans from this fund
for housing projects and programs in municipalities whose housing elements have
obtained compliance certification pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2024, c.2
(C.52:27D-304.1), or in municipalities receiving State aid pursuant to
P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178 et seq.).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Of those monies deposited
into the &quot;New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund&quot; that are derived
from municipal development fee trust funds, or from available collections of
Statewide non-residential development fees, a priority for funding shall be
established for projects in municipalities that have received compliance
certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Programs and projects in
any municipality shall be funded only after receipt by the commissioner of
either:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  a written statement in
support of the program or project from the municipal governing body; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  a written statement in
support of the program or project from the municipal clerk, if the municipality
has enacted an ordinance pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2024, c.5 (C.
52:27D-304.1a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  The commissioner
shall establish rules and regulations governing the qualifications of
applicants, the application procedures, and the criteria for awarding grants
and loans and the standards for establishing the amount, terms, and conditions
of each grant or loan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The governing body of a
municipality in which a housing project or program is located, and which is
awarded a grant or loan from the fund for a housing project or program, may
provide, by ordinance , that the units of affordable housing being developed or
preserved pursuant to a housing project or program being funded, in whole or in
part, through the &quot;New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund&quot; shall be
exempt from real property taxation if the housing sponsor enters into an
agreement with the municipality for payments to the municipality in lieu of
taxes for municipal services.  Any such agreement may require the housing
sponsor to pay to the municipality an amount up to 20 percent of the annual
gross revenue from each housing project situated on such real property for each
year of operation of the agreement following the substantial completion of the
housing project.  Any such agreement shall require the housing sponsor to pay
the municipality an amount not less than the greater of four percent of the
annual gross revenue or the amount of the taxes attributable to the land value
component of the property comprising the project site for the year preceding
the recording of the mortgage, if applicable.  In the case of a property
assessed under the &quot;Farmland Assessment Act of 1964,&quot; P.L.1964, c.48
(C.54:4-23.1 et seq.), the minimum amount the housing sponsor shall be required
to pay to the municipality shall be four percent of the annual gross revenue. 
For the purpose of this subsection, &quot;annual gross revenue&quot; means the
total annual gross rental or carrying charge and other income of a housing
sponsor from a housing project.  If an agreement is entered into from the date
of recording the mortgage on the housing project to the date of substantial
completion of the housing project, the annual amount payable to the
municipality as taxes or as payments in lieu of taxes in respect of the project
site shall not be in excess of the amount of taxes on the project site for the
year preceding the recording of the mortgage.  Within 30 calendar days
following: the effective date of an ordinance adopted by a municipal governing
body approving a tax exemption under this subsection; or the execution of a
financial agreement between a housing sponsor and a municipality entered into
pursuant to this subsection, whichever is later, the municipal clerk shall
electronically transmit a certified copy of the ordinance and the agreement to
the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in such a manner as
may be specified by the director.  An exemption from taxation provided pursuant
to this subsection shall not extend beyond the date on which an eligible loan
made for the project is paid in full.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Notwithstanding the
provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the governing body of a
municipality may agree to continue a tax exemption for a State, federally, or
municipally subsidized housing project beyond the date on which an eligible
loan made for the project is fully paid, or beyond the date upon which a tax
exemption expires, for any period the project remains subject to affordability
controls pursuant to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  project-based federal

moderate-income housing need as determined pursuant to the low- and
moderate-income household growth over the prior 10 years, as calculated
pursuant to section 6 of P.L.2024, c.2 (C.52:27D-304.2).  Amounts in the fund

it administers which: (a) are unusable or in a serious state of disrepair; (b)
can be restored in an economically feasible and sound manner; and (c) can be
retained in a safe, decent, and sanitary manner, upon completion of

agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall incorporate contractual

occupied by low- and moderate-income households for a period that conforms to
the requirements of subsection f. of section 21 of P.L.1985, c.222

provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, in making
grants or loans under this section, the department shall not require that
tenants be certified as low- or moderate-income or that contractual guarantees
or deed restrictions be in place to ensure continued low- and moderate-income
occupancy as a condition of providing housing assistance from any program
administered by the department, when that assistance is provided for a project
of moderate rehabilitation if the project: (1) contains 30 or fewer rental
units; and (2) is located in a census tract in which the median household
income is 60 percent or less of the median income for the housing region in
