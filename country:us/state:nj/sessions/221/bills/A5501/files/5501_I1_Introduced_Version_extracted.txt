(2)  Of those monies deposited into the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" that are derived from municipal development fee trust funds, or from available collections of Statewide non-residential development fees, a priority for funding shall be established for projects in municipalities that have received compliance certification. (3)  Programs and projects in any municipality shall be funded only after receipt by the commissioner of either: (a)  a written statement in support of the program or project from the municipal governing body; or (b)  a written statement in support of the program or project from the municipal clerk, if the municipality has enacted an ordinance pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2024, c.5 (C. 52:27D-304.1a). b.    (1)  The commissioner shall establish rules and regulations governing the qualifications of applicants, the application procedures, and the criteria for awarding grants and loans and the standards for establishing the amount, terms, and conditions of each grant or loan. (2)  The governing body of a municipality in which a housing project or program is located, and which is awarded a grant or loan from the fund for a housing project or program, may provide, by ordinance , that the units of affordable housing being developed or preserved pursuant to a housing project or program being funded, in whole or in part, through the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" shall be exempt from real property taxation if the housing sponsor enters into an agreement with the municipality for payments to the municipality in lieu of taxes for municipal services.  Any such agreement may require the housing sponsor to pay to the municipality an amount up to 20 percent of the annual gross revenue from each housing project situated on such real property for each year of operation of the agreement following the substantial completion of the housing project.  Any such agreement shall require the housing sponsor to pay the municipality an amount not less than the greater of four percent of the annual gross revenue or the amount of the taxes attributable to the land value component of the property comprising the project site for the year preceding the recording of the mortgage, if applicable.  In the case of a property assessed under the "Farmland Assessment Act of 1964," P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et seq.), the minimum amount the housing sponsor shall be required to pay to the municipality shall be four percent of the annual gross revenue.

(3)  Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the governing body of a municipality may agree to continue a tax exemption for a State, federally, or municipally subsidized housing project beyond the date on which an eligible loan made for the project is fully paid, or beyond the date upon which a tax exemption expires, for any period the project remains subject to affordability controls pursuant to: (a)  project-based federal rental assistance, authorized pursuant to section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. s.1437f), or other federal or State project-based assistance; (b)  the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls promulgated by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency; or (c)  the rent and income limits established by the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program pursuant to section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.42). c.  For any period which the commissioner may approve, the commissioner may assist affordable housing programs that are located in municipalities that have a pending request for compliance certification; provided that the affordable housing program will meet all or part of a municipal low- and moderate-income housing obligation. d.    Amounts deposited in the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" shall be targeted to regions based on the region's percentage of the State's low- and moderate-income housing need as determined pursuant to the low- and moderate-income household growth over the prior 10 years, as calculated pursuant to section 6 of P.L.2024, c.2 (C.52:27D-304.2).  Amounts in the fund shall be applied for the following purposes in designated neighborhoods: (1)   Rehabilitation of substandard housing units occupied or to be occupied by low- and moderate-income households; (2)   Creation of accessory dwelling units to be occupied by low- and moderate-income households; (3)   Conversion of non-residential space to residential purposes; provided a substantial percentage of the resulting housing units are to be occupied by low- and moderate-income households;
