<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 5 of P.L.2005,
c.156 (C.30:4J-12) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    a.  The purpose of the
program shall be to provide subsidized health insurance coverage, and other
health care benefits as determined by the commissioner, to children under 19
years of age and their parents or caretakers and to adults without dependent
children, within the limits of funds appropriated or otherwise made available
for the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The program shall require
families to pay copayments and make premium contributions, based upon a sliding
income scale.  The program shall include the provision of well-child and other
preventive services, hospitalization, physician care, laboratory and x-ray
services, prescription drugs, mental health services, and other services as
determined by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commissioner shall
take such actions as are necessary to implement and operate the program in
accordance with the State Children's Health Insurance Program established
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s.1397aa et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The commissioner:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   shall, by regulation,
establish standards for determining eligibility and other program requirements,
including, but not limited to, restrictions on voluntary disenrollments from
existing health insurance coverage;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   shall require that a
parent or caretaker who is a qualified applicant purchase coverage, if
available, through an employer-sponsored health insurance plan which is
determined to be cost-effective and is approved by the commissioner, and shall
provide assistance to the qualified applicant to purchase that coverage, except
that the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to require an
employer to provide health insurance coverage for any employee or employee's
spouse or dependent child;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   may, by regulation,
establish plans of coverage and benefits to be covered under the program,
except that the provisions of this section shall not apply to coverage for
medications used exclusively to treat AIDS or HIV infection; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   shall establish, by
regulation, other requirements for the program, including, but not limited to,
premium payments and copayments, and may contract with one or more appropriate
entities, including managed care organizations, to assist in administering the
program. The period for which eligibility for the program is determined shall
be the maximum period permitted under federal law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The commissioner shall
establish procedures for determining eligibility, which shall include, at a
minimum, the following enrollment simplification practices:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A streamlined
application form as established pursuant to subsection k. of this section;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Require new applicants
to submit one recent pay stub from the applicant's employer, or, if the
applicant has more than one employer, one from each of the applicant's
employers, to verify income.  In the event the applicant cannot provide a
recent pay stub, the applicant may submit another form of income verification
as deemed appropriate by the commissioner.  If an applicant does not submit
income verification in a timely manner, before determining the applicant
ineligible for the program, the commissioner shall seek to verify the
applicant's income by reviewing available Department of the Treasury and
Department of Labor and Workforce Development records concerning the applicant,
and such other records as the commissioner determines appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner shall
establish retrospective auditing or income verification procedures, such as
sample auditing and matching reported income with records of the Department of
the Treasury and the Department of Labor and Workforce Development and such
other records as the commissioner determines appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In matching reported income
with confidential records of the Department of the Treasury, the commissioner
shall require an applicant to provide written authorization for the Division of
Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to release applicable tax
information to the commissioner for the purposes of establishing income eligibility
for the program. The authorization, which shall be included on the program
application form, shall be developed by the commissioner, in consultation with
the State Treasurer; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Online enrollment and
renewal, in addition to enrollment and renewal by mail.  The online enrollment
and renewal forms shall include electronic links to other State and federal
health and social services programs;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Continuous enrollment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Simplified renewal by
sending an enrollee a preprinted renewal form and requiring the enrollee to
sign and return the form, with any applicable changes in the information
provided in the form, prior to the date the enrollee's annual eligibility
expires. The commissioner shall establish such auditing or income verification
procedures, as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection; <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b></p>

eligibility-identification cards that are issued no more frequently than once a
year<u>; and</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(7)   An eligibility
determination timeliness standard that provides for a new applicants
determination of eligibility as soon as all factors of eligibility are met and
verified, but not later than 21 days from the date of the initial application
submission.  When the determination of eligibility is made later than 21 days
from the date of the initial application submission, the eligibility
determination agency </u><u><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>responsible
for the intake and processing of the application</span> shall provide the
applicant written notification, immediately upon the expiration of the 21-day

the period of time in which a beneficiary may fail to pay a premium required
for NJ FamilyCare coverage before coverage is terminated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, this bill
requires the eligibility determination timeliness standard to provide for a new

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also provides that a
failure to pay a premium required for NJ FamilyCare coverage for three consecutive
months will result in the termination of coverage.  By current regulation,
N.J.A.C. 10:49-9.2 and 10:79-6.7, coverage is terminated the month after a
monthly plan premium payment is missed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The current law, as modified
by federal regulation, provides that an individual may be locked out or
ineligible to apply for coverage if that person was voluntarily disenrolled
from coverage within three months of their application to the program. This
bill, by providing that coverage be terminated after three consecutive missed
premium payments, instead of after one missed premium payment, will reduce the
number of individuals who lose coverage, and accordingly, prevent individuals
from being locked-out of or ineligible to apply for reinstatement of coverage
due to a single missed premium payment. </p>
