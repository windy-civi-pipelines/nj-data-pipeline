STATEMENT This bill requires the Commissioner of Health to develop a shared decision-making tool for use by maternity care hospitals and licensed birthing centers.  Use of the shared decision-making tool will be voluntary. The purpose of the shared decision-making tool will be to: improve knowledge of the benefits and risks of, and best practice standards for, the provision of maternity care; increase collaboration between a maternity care patient and the patients health care provider to assist the patient in making informed decisions about the maternity care the patient receives; improve patient experiences during, and reduce adverse outcomes related to, or associated with, pregnancy; and encourage maternity care patients to create a birth plan stating the patients preferences during the stages of labor, delivery, and postpartum.

The bill directs the commissioner to implement a three-year pilot program, under which a select number of maternity care hospitals and birthing centers may utilize and evaluate the shared decision-making tool developed pursuant to the bill.  The commissioner will develop a process for hospitals and birthing centers that are interested in participating in the pilot program to request to participate. The commissioner will determine the total number of participating hospitals and birthing centers, except that, at a minimum, the commissioner will be required to select at least one hospital or birthing facility from each of the northern, central, and southern regions of the State. The hospitals and birthing centers selected by the commissioner to participate in the pilot program will use a standardized, comprehensive evaluation process, to be designed by the commissioner, that will assess the effectiveness of the shared decision-making tool in improving maternal care and reducing adverse outcomes related to, or associated with, pregnancy by collecting and analyzing information, during the pilot program period, about maternal outcomes including.  The data to be collected using the evaluation process will include, but will not be limited to, the number and percentage of maternity care patients who: underwent non-medically indicated and medically-indicated labor induction procedures; underwent non-medically indicated and medically-indicated cesarean section procedures; underwent vaginal delivery; delivered at 41 or more weeks of gestation and delivered between 34 and 41 or more weeks of gestation; and created a birth plan.  The evaluation process data will additionally include any other information related to a maternity care patients prenatal, postnatal, labor, and delivery care that the commissioner deems necessary.

The bill provides that it will expire upon the submission of all of the reports required from participant hospitals and birthing centers.
