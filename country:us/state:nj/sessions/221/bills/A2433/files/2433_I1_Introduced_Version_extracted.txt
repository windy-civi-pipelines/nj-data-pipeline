(cf: P.L.2017, c.7, s.2) 2.    Section 3 of P.L.1995, c.328 (C.26:2-137.4) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a. A physician or registered professional nurse, as appropriate, shall perform lead screening on each patient [under six] 16 years of age or younger to whom the physician or registered professional nurse provides health care services, unless the physician or registered professional nurse has knowledge that the child has already undergone lead screening in accordance with the requirements of this act.  If the physician, registered professional nurse, or an authorized staff member cannot perform the required lead screening, the physician or registered professional nurse may refer the patient, in writing, to another physician, registered professional nurse, health care facility, or designated agency or program which is able to perform the lead screening. b.    A health care facility that serves children and is licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.), and any other agency or program that serves children and is designated by the commissioner to perform lead screening, shall perform lead screening on each child [under six] 16 years of age or younger that the facility, agency, or program serves, unless the facility, agency, or program has knowledge that the child has already undergone lead screening in accordance with the requirements of this act.  If the health care facility, agency, or program cannot perform the required lead screening, the facility, agency, or program may refer the patient, in writing, to another health care facility, physician, registered professional nurse, or other designated agency or program which is able to perform the lead screening. c.     If a physician, registered professional nurse, or health care facility, agency, or program receives laboratory test results indicating that a child has an elevated blood lead level, the physician, registered professional nurse, or health care facility, agency, or program shall notify the parent or guardian of the child, in writing, about the test results, and shall additionally provide the parent or guardian with an explanation, in plain language, of the significance of lead poisoning.  The physician, registered professional nurse, or health care facility, agency, or program shall also take appropriate measures to ensure that any of the child's siblings or other members of the household who are [under the age of six] 16 years of age or younger either are, or have been, screened for lead exposure. d.    A physician, registered professional nurse, or health care facility, agency, or program shall not be required to conduct lead screening under this act if the parent or guardian of the child objects to the testing in writing. e.     (1) The department shall specify, by regulation, the parameters for lead screening required under this act, including the age of the child when initial screening shall be conducted, the time intervals between screening, when follow-up testing is required, and the methods that shall be used to conduct the lead screening. (2)   (a)  The department shall additionally specify, by regulation, in accordance with the most recent recommendations of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the elevated blood lead levels that require responsive action under this act, and the types of responsive action, including environmental follow-up, notice to the family, additional screening of family members, the provision of case management services, and the provision of medical treatment such as chelation therapy, that shall be undertaken when a screening test reveals an elevated blood lead level.  The levels of responsive action required by the department pursuant to this paragraph may vary, consistent with the latest recommendations of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on the severity of the elevated blood lead level. (b)   Within 30 days after the enactment of P.L.2017, c.7, and on a biennial basis thereafter, the department shall review and appropriately revise its rules and regulations pertaining to elevated blood lead levels, in order to ensure that they appropriately reflect, and are consistent with, the latest guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. f.     The department shall develop a mechanism, such as distribution of lead screening record cards or other appropriate means, by which children who have undergone lead screening can be identified by physicians, registered professional nurses, and health care facilities, agencies, and programs that perform lead screening, so as to avoid duplicate lead screening of children. g.    The department shall continuously engage in a public information campaign to inform the parents of young children, as well as physicians, registered professional nurses, and other health care providers, of the lead screening requirements of this act. At a minimum, the public information campaign shall:  (1) highlight the importance of lead screening, and encourage parents, especially those who have not yet complied with the lead screening provisions of this act, to have their children screened for lead poisoning at regular intervals, in accordance with the age-based timeframes established by department regulation; and (2) provide for the widespread dissemination of information to parents and health care providers on the dangers of lead poisoning, the factors that contribute to lead poisoning, the recommended ages at which children should be tested for lead poisoning, and the elevated blood lead levels that require responsive action under this act.  If the department changes the elevated blood lead levels that require responsive action under this act, as may be necessary to conform its regulations to federal guidance, the information disseminated through the public information campaign shall be appropriately revised to reflect the new action levels, and shall be reissued to parents and health care providers, within 30 days after the change is implemented. h.    The department, to the greatest extent possible, shall coordinate payment for lead screening required pursuant to this act with the State Medicaid program established pursuant to P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.) and other federal children's health programs, so as to ensure that the State receives the maximum amount of federal financial participation available for the lead screening services provided pursuant to this act. (cf: P.L.2017, c.7, s.5.) 3.    This act shall take effect on the 90th day after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires health insurance companies to cover lead screenings for children 16 years of age or younger.  Under current law, health insurance companies are only required to cover screenings by blood lead measurement for children under the age of six. This bill will help protect the children of New Jersey from the harms of lead poisoning and elevated blood lead levels.  There is no safe level of lead exposure in children, as even low levels of lead in the bloodstream can stunt a childs development.  By requiring health insurance companies to cover lead screenings in children who are 16 years of age or younger, the State will be taking a substantial step to detect lead exposure in children before it is too late.
