education, generally defined as the board of education of any local school
district, consolidated school district, regional school district, county
vocational school, and any other board of education or other similar body, the
board of directors of an educational services commission, and the administrative

the bill permits a board of education to contract with personnel to ensure
required programs and services are provided and are not required to directly
employ the personnel, provided that the personnel hold an applicable
certificate. Under the bill, the personnel include: (1) a substitute teacher;
(2) personnel providing instruction in financial, economic, business, and

supplement existing district services; (3) home instruction; (4) speech-language
services in certain circumstances; and (5) related services, provided that
certified occupational therapy assistants, others employed in a supportive role

exemptions to the provisions of the bill that require a school district to
directly employ certain professionals.</p>

a school district to utilize virtual or remote instruction for a student or a
class of students when equivalent instruction cannot be provided through
in-person instruction, subject to the approval of the commissioner and
establishes an application process for a school district to apply for
individualized virtual or remote instruction for a student or a class of
students. Under the bill, the commissioner is required to establish a process
for notifying an individual currently providing the instructional services
which are being sought to be implemented virtually or remotely, and the
majority representative of the districts employees of the submission of an
application and provide them with a copy of the application and notice of the
right to object to, or comment on, the application prior to the commissioners

the majority representative of the districts employees regarding a
determination on the request for virtual or remote instruction and a procedure
for a school district to them to appeal the determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill permits <span

virtual or remote instruction pursuant to the provisions of the bill to utilize
virtual or remote instruction on a temporary basis without the approval of the

charter schools and renaissance school projects to provide virtual or remote
instruction, either in whole or in part, for summer school sessions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill specifies that
individualized student learning opportunities that meet or exceed the New
Jersey Student Learning Standards for students in grades nine through 12
include (1) independent study, (2) study abroad programs, (3) student exchange
programs, (4) credit recovery programs; and (5) structured learning
experiences, including, but not limited to, work-based programs, internships,
apprenticeships, and service-learning experiences. Under the bill, the board is
to determine if an individualized student learning opportunity may be completed
by virtual or remote instruction, either in whole or in part. Pursuant to the
bill, individualized student learning opportunities are required to apply
toward the credit requirement for a State-endorsed diploma established under State
Board of Education regulations.</p>
