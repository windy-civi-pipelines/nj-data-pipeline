STATEMENT This bill authorizes special Operation Desert Storm license plates.  The license plate is to display the words and images that honor members of the military that served in Operation Desert Storm, which was a military operation to defend and expel Iraqi forces that invaded Kuwait.  An application to obtain Operation Desert Storm license plates is to include satisfactory proof that the applicant served in Operation Desert Storm.  In addition to the required motor vehicle registration fees, there is an application fee of $50 and an annual renewal fee of $10 for the Operation Desert Storm license plates.  After deducting the cost to implement the license plates, the additional fees collected are to be deposited into the Operation Desert Storm License Fund and the funds are to be appropriated annually to the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (department) for programs to benefit combat veterans. The Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (commission) is required to annually certify the average cost of producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the availability of the specialty license plates.  If the average cost per plate exceeds $50 in two consecutive fiscal years, the chief administrator may discontinue the license plate program.

The bill requires that an individual or entity designated by the department contribute non-public monies, not to exceed $25,000, to offset the initial cost to design, produce, issue, and publicize the license plates and for any computer programming necessary to implement the program.  The bill authorizes the department to receive funds from private sources to be used to offset the initial costs. The commission is not required to design, produce, issue, or publicize the availability of the license plates or make any necessary programming changes, until: (1) the individual or entity designated by the department has provided the commission with the money necessary to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission in establishing the license plate program; and (2) the liaison appointed by the department has provided the commission with a minimum of 500 completed applications for the license plates. The provisions of the bill will remain inoperative until the first day of the 13th month following the date on which the money to offset the initial costs to establish the license plate program and a minimum of 500 applications are provided to the commission.  The bill expires on the last day of the 12th month after enactment if sufficient applications and fees to offset the initial costs are not received by that date.
