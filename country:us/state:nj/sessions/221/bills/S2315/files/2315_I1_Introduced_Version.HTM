an uncertified recovery residence administrator shall remain ineligible to
obtain a certificate of compliance until such time as the recovery residence
administrator obtains professional certification pursuant to this act.  For the
purposes of expediency, the credentialing entity may consider an application

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
Department of Community Affairs (DCA), within 120 days after the bills
enactment, to approve a credentialing entity to develop and administer a
voluntary certification program for recovery residences and recovery residence
administrators in the State.  Recovery residence is defined by the bill to
mean housing with a home-like atmosphere, which is available in a
professionally-managed facility (i.e., a facility that is directly managed by a
recovery residence administrator) or in a peer-managed facility (i.e., a
facility that is cooperatively self-managed by residents in recovery who are
renting rooms at the facility), and which provides a sober living environment
and alcohol and drug free living accommodations to individuals with substance
use disorders, or to individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance
use disorders, but which does not provide clinical treatment services for
mental health or substance use disorders.  The term includes, but is not
limited to, facilities that are commonly referred to as sober living homes. 
Recovery residence administrator is defined as the owner or operator of a
recovery residence who is responsible for the overall management of the
recovery residence, including, but not limited to, the supervision of residents
and staff, and who does not reside in the recovery residence.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the DCA to
use a portion of the monies annually appropriated thereto to provide
appropriate funds to the credentialing entity, on an annual basis, to enable
the credentialing entity to fulfill its duties and responsibilities under the
bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In developing the recovery
residence certification program (which is to become operational within 180 days
after the credentialing entity is approved by the DCA), the credentialing
entity is required to:  1) establish requirements for the voluntary
certification of recovery residences and recovery residence administrators, as
well as for the annual recertification of certified residences and
administrators; 2) establish criminal background check requirements for the
administrators and employees of professionally-managed facilities, as deemed by
the credentialing entity to be necessary; 3) administer all aspects of the
certification program and establish procedures to facilitate the application,
certification, and annual recertification processes; 4) engage in the on-site
pre-certification inspection of recovery residences applying for certification;
5) establish procedures and protocols for the regular monitoring and inspection
of certified recovery residences, which procedures and protocols must, at a
minimum, require at least one unannounced on-site inspection of each certified
recovery residence as a condition of annual recertification; and 6) establish
an Internet website to provide information to the public about the recovery
residence certification program.  The requirements adopted under the recovery
residence certification program are to be consistent with applicable standards
adopted by the National Alliance for Recovery Residences (NARR).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The credentialing entity is
required to issue a certificate of compliance to any recovery residence, upon
application therefor, provided that the residence satisfactorily passes a
pre-certification inspection, complies with all other certification
requirements established by the credentialing entity, and is either
professionally managed by a certified recovery residence administrator or is a
peer-managed facility.  A recovery residence that is professionally managed by
an uncertified administrator is not eligible to obtain a certificate of
compliance until such time as the recovery residence administrator obtains
professional certification.  The bill specifies that, for the purposes of
expediency, the credentialing entity may consider an application for the
professional certification of an administrator at the same time as it is
considering an application for certification of the recovery residence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A recovery residence
administrator or other recovery residence employee or volunteer is prohibited
from advertising, representing, or implying to the public that the recovery
residence is a certified recovery residence unless the residence has obtained
a certificate of compliance from the credentialing entity.  Similarly, a recovery
residence administrator or other recovery residence employee or volunteer is
prohibited from advertising, representing, or implying to the public that the
administrator is a certified recovery residence administrator unless the
administrator has obtained a professional certification from the credentialing
entity.  Any person who violates these provisions is subject to a civil penalty
of up to $1,000 for each offense.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A certificate of compliance
issued to a recovery residence, and a professional certification issued to a
recovery residence administrator, is valid for a period of one year from the
date of issuance.  The credentialing entity is authorized to suspend, revoke,
or refuse to renew a certificate of compliance issued to a recovery residence if
it finds that the residence has violated any certification requirements or that
the residence, if professionally managed, is no longer being managed by a
certified administrator.  The credentialing entity is authorized to suspend,
revoke, or refuse to renew the professional certification issued to an
administrator, if it finds that the administrator is not in compliance with the
requirements necessary to maintain such certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 180 days after the
recovery residence certification program becomes operational, the credentialing
entity is required to publish, on its website, a list that provides contact
information for all recovery residences that have obtained a certificate of
compliance.  The credentialing entity is to notify the DCA, immediately upon
publication, that the list is publicly available.  The bill specifies that the
published list of certified recovery residences may not include the names or
contact information of any individual resident of a recovery residence, but,
instead, is to include contact information only for the residence or the owner
of the residence, as deemed appropriate by the credentialing entity.  At no
point is the credentialing entity authorized to disclose any personally
identifying information about the residents of a recovery residence.  The
credentialing entity is required to regularly update the list of certified
recovery residences to ensure that the list reflects the most up-to-date
certification information.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The DCA is similarly required
to update its website to reflect its approval of the credentialing entity and
to provide the public with the name and contact information of the
credentialing entity, as well as a link to the entitys website.  Upon the
DCAs receipt of notice that the credentialing entity has published a list of
certified recovery residences, the DCA is required to notify all health care
practitioners and substance use disorder treatment providers in the State about
the availability of the list and about the bills requirements regarding professional
referrals to recovery residences.  In particular, a health care practitioner or
substance use disorder treatment provider is prohibited from referring a
patient to a recovery residence unless the recovery residence is listed as a
certified recovery residence on the credentialing entitys website, or the
recovery residence, whether certified or not, is owned or operated by a
licensed or certified substance use disorder treatment provider or by a wholly
owned subsidiary thereof.  However, the bill specifies that nothing in its
provisions may be deemed to require a health care practitioner or substance use
disorder treatment provider to refer any patient to a recovery residence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies that a
recovery residence, whether certified or not, may not be considered to be
either a health care facility within the meaning of the Health Care Facilities
Planning Act, P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.), or a substance use disorder
treatment facility within the meaning of P.L.1970, c.334 (C.26:2G-21 et seq.),
and P.L.1975, c.305 (C.26:2B-7 et seq.).  The bill further specifies that any
recovery residence that holds a valid certificate of compliance may not be
considered to be a rooming or boarding house, and is to be exempted from the
provisions of the Rooming and Boarding House Act of 1979, P.L.1979, c.496
(C.55:13B-1 et seq.).  Uncertified recovery residences are to remain subject to
applicable rooming and boarding house requirements.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, a certified
recovery residence is to be exempt from any rules and regulations governing the
operation or certification of recovery residences or sober living homes, which
were adopted prior to the bills effective date.  This bill effectively supersedes
all other pre-existing rules and regulations on this issue. </p>
