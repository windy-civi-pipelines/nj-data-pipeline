Upon completion of a RAP, an apprentice receives a certification that is recognized nationwide and allows the apprentice to be considered a journeyman in the profession for which that individual received certification. RAPs are recognized federally by the U.S. Department of Labor, which is authorized under federal law to promote the furtherance of labor standards required to protect the welfare of apprentices. The State established the New Jersey Apprenticeship Program to create and expand on existing pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs that are registered with the U.S. Department of Labor. Current federal legislation, H.R. 447, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021, invests more than $3.5 billion over a period of five years to expand opportunities and access to RAPs and enjoys bipartisan support.
