Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.34:15-36 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     34:15-36.  &quot;Willful
negligence&quot; within the intent of this chapter shall consist of (1)
deliberate act or deliberate failure to act, or (2) such conduct as evidences
reckless indifference to safety, or (3) intoxication, operating as the
proximate cause of injury, or (4) unlawful use of a controlled dangerous
substance as defined in the &quot;New Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances
Act,&quot; P.L.1970, c.226 (C.24:21-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Employer&quot; is
declared to be synonymous with master, and includes natural persons,
partnerships, and corporations; &quot;employee&quot; is synonymous with
servant, and includes all natural persons, including officers of corporations,
who perform service for an employer for financial consideration, exclusive of
(1) employees eligible under the federal &quot;Longshore and Harbor Workers'
Compensation Act,&quot; 44 Stat. 1424 (33 U.S.C.s.901 et seq.), for benefits
payable with respect to accidental death or injury, or occupational disease or
infection; and (2) casual employments, which shall be defined, if in connection
with the employer's business, as employment the occasion for which arises by
chance or is purely accidental; or if not in connection with any business of
the employer, as employment not regular, periodic or recurring; provided,
however, that forest fire wardens and forest firefighters employed by the State
of New Jersey shall, in no event, be deemed casual employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A self-employed person,
partners of a limited liability partnership, members of a limited liability
company or partners of a partnership who actively perform services on behalf of
the self-employed person's business, the limited liability partnership, limited
liability company or the partnership shall be deemed an &quot;employee&quot; of
the business, limited liability partnership, limited liability company or
partnership for purposes of receipt of benefits and payment of premiums
pursuant to this chapter, if the business, limited liability partnership,
limited liability company or partnership elects, when the workers' compensation
policy of the business, limited liability partnership, limited liability
company or partnership is purchased or renewed, to obtain coverage for the
person, the limited liability partners, the limited liability company members
or the partners. If the business, limited liability partnership, limited
liability company or partnership elects to obtain coverage for the
self-employed person, limited liability partners, limited liability company
members or the partners, the election may only be made at purchase or at
renewal and may not be withdrawn during the policy term.  If the business,
limited liability partnership, limited liability company or partnership
performs services covered under a homeowner's policy or other policies
providing comprehensive personal liability insurance for domestic servants,
household employees or the dependents thereof, the workers' compensation policy
of the business, limited liability partnership, limited liability company or
partnership shall have primary responsibility for the payment of benefits. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of R.S.34:15-71 and 34:15-72, the business,
limited liability partnership, limited liability company or partnership shall
not be required to purchase a policy unless the business, limited liability
partnership, limited liability company or partnership is an
&quot;employer&quot; of <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>a<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>at</u>
least one employee as defined in this section who is not a self-employed
person, limited liability partner, limited liability company member or partner
actively performing services on behalf of the business, limited liability
partnership, limited liability company or partnership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>An individual who is the
only individual performing services for an S corporation and is the only
shareholder in the corporation shall</u> <u>not be deemed an
&quot;employee&quot; of the corporation for purposes of receipt of benefits and
payment of premiums pursuant to R.S.34:15-1 et seq., unless the corporation
elects, to obtain coverage for the individual.  This paragraph shall not be
construed as modifying in any way the status of any individual or corporation
with respect to any tax or other law other than the workers compensation law.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of law to the contrary, no insurer or insurance producer as defined
in section <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>2
of P.L.1987, c.293 (C.17:22A-2)<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>3 of P.L.2001, c.210 (C.17:22A-28)</u> shall be liable in an action for
damages on account of the failure of a business, limited liability partnership,
limited liability company or partnership to elect to obtain workers'
compensation coverage for a self-employed person, limited liability partner,
limited liability company member or partner, unless the insurer or insurance
producer causes damage by a willful, wanton or grossly negligent act of
commission or omission. Every application for workers' compensation made on or
after the effective date of this amendatory act shall include notice, as
approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, concerning the
availability of workers' compensation coverage for self-employed persons,
limited liability partners, limited liability company members or partners. That
application shall also contain a notice of election of coverage and shall
clearly state that coverage for self-employed persons, limited liability
partners, limited liability company members and partners shall not be provided
under the policy unless the application containing the notice of election is
executed and filed with the insurer or insurance producer.  The application
containing the notice of election shall also contain a statement that the
insurer or insurance producer shall not be liable in an action for damages on
account of the failure of a business, limited liability partnership, limited
liability company or partnership to elect to obtain workers' compensation
coverage for a self-employed person, limited liability partner, limited
liability company member or partner, unless the insurer or insurance producer
causes damage by a willful, wanton or grossly negligent act of commission or
omission. The failure of a self-employed person, limited liability partnership,
limited liability company or partnership to elect to obtain workers'
compensation coverage for the self-employed person, the limited liability
partners, the limited liability company members or the partners shall not
affect benefits available under any other accident or health policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Employment shall be deemed to
commence when an employee arrives at the employer's place of employment to
report for work and shall terminate when the employee leaves the employer's
place of employment, excluding areas not under the control of the employer;
provided, however, when the employee is required by the employer to be away
from the employer's place of employment, the employee shall be deemed to be in
the course of employment when the employee is engaged in the direct performance
of duties assigned or directed by the employer; but the employment of employee
paid travel time by an employer for time spent traveling to and from a job site
or of any employee who utilizes an employer authorized vehicle shall commence
