(1)   Upon the death of a person from any of the causes specified in subsection a. of this section, it shall be the duty of the physician in attendance, a law enforcement officer having knowledge of the death, the funeral director, or any other person present, to immediately notify the county or intercounty medical examiner and the county prosecutor of the county in which the death occurred of the known facts concerning the time, place, manner, and circumstances of that death.

(c)   The medical examiner or medicolegal death investigator, as the case may be, shall take possession of any objects or articles that, in his opinion, may be useful in establishing the cause or manner of death, or which constitute evidence of criminal behavior, and, after cataloging each item, deliver them to the county prosecutor. (4)   The Chief State Medical Examiner, Deputy Chief State Medical Examiner, county or intercounty medical examiner, assistant county or intercounty medical examiner, or medicolegal death investigator shall consult with law enforcement officers and agencies, county prosecutors, public health agencies, or other appropriate entities in matters within their expertise, when conducting a medicolegal death investigation.  The medical examiner or medicolegal death investigator, as the case may be, shall be provided with an Originating Agency Identification Number, and access to the State's motor vehicle registries and fingerprint registries, for the purposes of identifying the remains of a deceased individual under this section.

(c)   The medical examiner with jurisdiction for the investigation shall make the preliminary findings and conclusions of the autopsy available to the child's parent or legal guardian and the department within 48 hours after the medical examiner is notified of the death of the child.  The medical examiner shall provide his findings and conclusions for each reported case to the department upon completion of the investigation.

(9)   In the case of the death of a resident of a long-term care facility licensed by the Department of Health pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.), a State psychiatric hospital operated by the Department of Health and listed in R.S.30:1-7, a county psychiatric hospital, a facility for persons with developmental disabilities as defined in section 3 of P.L.1977, c.82 (C.30:6D-3), or a facility for persons with traumatic brain injury as defined in 42 U.S.C. s.280b-1c that is operated by or under contract with the Department of Human Services, the psychiatric hospital or facility, as the case may be, shall, in addition to notifying the next-of-kin of the resident's death, so notify the county or intercounty medical examiner and provide that individual with contact information for the resident's next-of-kin.  The county or intercounty medical examiner, or assistant county or intercounty medical examiner on his behalf, shall make every practicable effort to contact the resident's next-of-kin to offer that person the opportunity to provide the medical examiner with information that the person deems relevant to:  the circumstances of the resident's death; and whether there is a need to perform a dissection or autopsy of the decedent. d.    Upon the request of a decedent's legal representative, or upon the request of the person who, pursuant to section 22 of P.L.2003, c.261 (C.45:27-22), is in control of the decedent's funeral, the Chief State Medical Examiner shall provide the legal representative or person in control of the funeral with all available documentation related to the decedent's autopsy and the medical investigation of the decedent's death. (cf: P.L.2018, c.62, s.10) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires a law enforcement officer who has responded to an incident involving a dead body to remain with the body until the medical examiner arrives to take charge of the body.
