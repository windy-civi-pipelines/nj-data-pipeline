<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning the end-of-life management of electronic
cigarettes and supplementing Title 13 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  This act shall be known
and may be cited as the &quot;Electronic Cigarette Extended Producer
Responsibility Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) In the past decade, consumption
and sales of electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, have risen dramatically
worldwide;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Approximately 60 million
e-cigarettes and refills are sold annually, and one-third of these are designed
for single-use, according to a 2019 study in the Journal of Environmental
Management;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) E-cigarettes are a growing
waste management concern because, despite their small size, they are consumed
and discarded much more quickly than typical electronics;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) The disposal of
e-cigarette waste products into the environment is problematic due to the
presence of oxidants, reactive oxygen species, nanoparticles, metals, and toxic
compounds including nicotine, carbonyls, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
such as benzene and toluene;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  Local governments,
businesses, and residents of the State do not have ready access to an
efficient, environmentally sound, and cost-effective disposal method for e-cigarettes;
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) The producers of e-cigarettes
are best able to assume responsibility for the development and implementation
of a cost-effective e-cigarette stewardship program that will promote the refurbishment,
reuse, and recycling of e-cigarettes, including vaporizers and batteries, and will
provide for the collection, transportation, and processing of discarded
e-cigarettes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The Legislature therefore
determines that it is in the best interests of the State for the producers of e-cigarettes
to form a producer responsibility organization and to develop and implement a program
to collect, reuse, recycle, transport, and soundly dispose of discarded e-cigarettes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Department&quot; means
the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Distributor&quot; means
a person who has a contractual relationship with one or more producers to
market and sell e-cigarettes to retailers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;E-cigarette stewardship
plan&quot; or &quot;stewardship plan&quot; means the plan developed pursuant to
section 5 of this act, and which provides for the environmentally sound
life-cycle management, by participating producers, of e-cigarettes that are
sold or offered for sale in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Electronic cigarette&quot;
or &quot;e-cigarette&quot; means:  (1) any device that employs a battery or
other mechanism to heat a solution or substance to produce a vapor or aerosol
intended for inhalation, including an electronic cigar, electronic cigarillo,
electronic pipe, electronic hookah, or vape pen; (2) any cartridge or container
of a solution or substance intended to be used with or in the device or to
refill the device; or (3) any solution or substance, whether or not it contains
nicotine, intended for use in the device.  &quot;Electronic cigarette&quot;
does not include: cigarettes, as defined in section 102 of the &quot;Cigarette
Tax Act,&quot; P.L.1948, c.65 (C.54:40A-2), any product approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration for sale as a tobacco cessation product, a
tobacco dependence product, or for other medical purposes, and which is
marketed and sold solely for that approved purpose, or any asthma inhaler
prescribed by a physician for that condition that is marketed and sold solely
for that approved purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Environmentally sound
management practices&quot; means policies or procedures for the collection,
storage, transportation, reuse, recycling, and disposal of e-cigarettes, which
ensure compliance with all applicable federal, State, and local laws, rules,
regulations, and ordinances, and the protection of human health and the
environment, and which address matters such as adequate recordkeeping, accurate
tracking and documentation of the use, reuse, recycling, or disposal of
post-consumer e-cigarettes within and outside of the State, and adequate
provision of environmental liability coverage for professional services and for
the operations of contractors working on behalf of a producer or representative
organization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Federal waste management
hierarchy&quot; means the four-tiered hierarchy, established by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency, that guides waste management
determinations through the promotion of source reduction, recycling, energy
recovery, and waste treatment and disposal, in that order, to the extent
feasible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Post-consumer e-cigarette&quot;
means an e-cigarette that is not used and no longer wanted by a consumer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Producer&quot; means a
manufacturer of an e-cigarette that is sold, offered for sale, or distributed
in the State, either under the producer's own name or under any other brand
name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Producer responsibility
organization&quot; or &quot;PRO&quot; means an organization that is exempt from
taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986
and is formed for the purpose of implementing a producer responsibility plan to
meet the requirements of this act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Recycling&quot; means
any process by which materials or products that would otherwise become solid

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, to be known as the &quot;Electronic
Cigarette Extended Producer Responsibility Act,&quot; would require producers
of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and their component parts to form a
producer responsibility organization (PRO) and develop and implement a plan to
provide for the sound disposal of e-cigarettes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the
formation of the PRO within two years after the bill's enactment.  The bill
would require the PRO to be approved by the Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP), and to meet certain standards established by the bill. 
Within five years after the bill's enactment, the bill would require the PRO to
submit an &quot;e-cigarette stewardship plan&quot; to the DEP.  The plan would
be required to, among other things, provide collection site locations Statewide
that will accept post-consumer e-cigarettes such that: (1) at least 90 percent
of State residents have a permanent collection site within 15 miles of their
residence; (2) permanent collection sites be established for every 30,000
residents of a population center, and (3) collection sites be distributed to
provide convenient and equitable access for residents within each population
center.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also require
the PRO to charge fees to its members, in order to fund the PRO's activities
and the implementation of the e-cigarette stewardship plan.  The fees would be
based, in part, on the quantity of e-cigarettes sold by the member in the
State.  The fees would also be based on the environmental impact of the
e-cigarette, with, for example, lower fees being charged for reusable
e-cigarettes and e-cigarettes that contain recycled content.  The bill would
require the DEP to approve the e-cigarette stewardship plan, according to
certain procedures established in section 6 of the bill, and the bill would
require the plan to be updated at least every five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Beginning six years after the
bill's effective date, the bill would prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes made by
producers that do not join the PRO, and the bill would establish civil
penalties of $500 for producers, distributors, and retailers that sell the
prohibited e-cigarettes.  The bill would authorize the DEP, municipalities, and
county environmental enforcement agencies to enforce this prohibition.  The
bill would also authorize the DEP to assess civil administrative penalties of
up to $10,000 per violation for any violation of the bill's provisions.</p>
