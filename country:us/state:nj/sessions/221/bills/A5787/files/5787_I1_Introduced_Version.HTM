Similar to the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Act, the bill includes a provision providing that if the State does not make the appropriations and distributions required under the bill, the State would forgo the collection of certain corporation business tax revenues from all corporate taxpayers that are not public utilities for that tax year. Amounts distributed to municipalities from the Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid Fund in excess of the amount distributed to the municipality from the "Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund" during the State fiscal year 2002 is to be used for the purpose of reducing the amount the municipality is required to raise by local property tax levy for municipal purposes.

Under the bill, no municipality would receive less than the amount received in Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid in calendar year 2024, or State fiscal year 2025 for a municipality that utilizes a State fiscal year budget cycle.  State aid provided to municipalities in excess of $1,455,000,000 would be distributed pursuant to a formula developed by the Commissioner of Community Affairs, as specified in the bill. Similar to the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Act, the bill includes a provision providing that if the State does not make the appropriations and distributions required under the bill, the State would forgo the collection of certain corporation business tax revenues from all corporate taxpayers that are not public utilities for that tax year. Amounts distributed to municipalities from the Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid Fund in excess of the amount distributed to the municipality from the "Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund" during the State fiscal year 2002 is to be used for the purpose of reducing the amount the municipality is required to raise by local property tax levy for municipal purposes. Under the bill, in any year that certain net payments from specified sources to the State exceed $1.425 billion, 75 percent of the amount in excess of $1.425 billion would be required to be credited to the "Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid Fund" and distributed to municipalities as additional aid.
