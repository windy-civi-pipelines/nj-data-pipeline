Operation Noble Eagle officially began on September 12, 2001, and is the name given to military operations to support homeland security and support federal, State, and local agencies in the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Operation Enduring Freedom, the official name for the Global War on Terrorism, began in October 2001.  This operation primarily refers to the War in Afghanistan, although additional missions are included in the operation.  Operation Enduring Freedom was completed in 2014.  Subsequent operations in Afghanistan by the United States military were completed under the official name Operation Freedoms Sentinel. Operation Freedoms Sentinel was a coalition mission to train, advise, and assist Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and to conduct counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al Qaeda. Operation Iraqi Freedom began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States led coalition which overthrew the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein, and continued through 2011 as the collation forces fought an insurgency in Iraq.  Operation Inherent Resolve, begun in 2014, is the name given to United States military and coalition forces united to support the Iraqi Security Force operations and to complete military campaigns in Iraq, Syria, and Libya.
