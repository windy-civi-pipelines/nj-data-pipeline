Any person, in a municipality operating under Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes, who, prior to the adoption of the State Uniform Construction Code, held the equivalent of the job title "construction" official or "subcode" official, but who no longer holds [his] that position as a result of a determination that [his] the officials old job title was not equivalent to that of "construction" official or "subcode" official, shall be offered reappointment as a construction official or subcode official, as the case may be, and shall be granted permanent classified status in such position.  Tenure shall continue for (1) any construction official or subcode official who is serving under tenure as otherwise provided by law on the effective date of this act or within one year thereafter, or (2) any person certified pursuant to subsection c. of this section and who subsequently gains such tenure. A construction official or subcode official appointed in a municipality operating under the provisions of Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes, who, at the time of adoption of the State Uniform Construction Code, January 1, 1977, or prior to January 1, 1981, had permanent classified status or was employed as a construction official or subcode official or in another position in the unclassified service, shall be included in the classified service without civil service examination in his respective title of construction official or subcode official.  Any individual employed by a municipality, who, in his employment with the municipality between January 1, 1977 and prior to January 1, 1981, was charged with the chief administrative responsibility to enforce all existing municipal construction codes, shall be deemed as appointed to the position of construction official for the purposes of this act.  Any individual employed by a municipality, who, in his employment with the municipality between January 1, 1977 and prior to January 1, 1981, was charged with chief responsibility to enforce the municipal building, plumbing, fire, or electrical code, shall be deemed as appointed to the position of subcode official for the purposes of this act.  No person, on or after January 1, 1981, shall be appointed as construction or subcode official in a municipality operating under Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes without having passed an examination administered by the Civil Service Commission certifying the merit and fitness of the person to hold such position; provided that, whenever a noncivil service municipality adopts the provisions of that Title, construction code officials and subcode officials of such municipality appointed prior to the filing of the petition for the adoption of civil service, shall attain permanent status in the classified service without examination.  Any construction or subcode official appointed after January 1, 1981 on a provisional basis in a municipality which has adopted the provisions of Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes, may not be removed from office except for just cause after a fair and impartial hearing has been held at the local level, with no further appeal to the Civil Service Commission; provided, however, that such a construction or subcode official may be removed to permit the appointment of a person certified for appointment by the Civil Service Commission.  A construction official or subcode official in a noncivil service municipality shall be appointed for a term of four years and shall, upon appointment to a second consecutive term or on or after the commencement of a fifth consecutive year of service, including years of service in an equivalent job title held prior to the adoption of the State Uniform Construction Code, be granted tenure and shall not be removed from office except for just cause after a fair and impartial hearing. A construction or subcode official, to be eligible for appointment in civil service or noncivil service municipalities, shall be certified by the State of New Jersey in accordance with subsection c. of this section and shall have had at least three years' experience in construction, design, or supervision as a licensed engineer or registered architect; or five years' experience in construction, design, or supervision as an architect or engineer with a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution of higher education; or 10 years' experience in construction, design, or supervision as a journeyman in a trade or as a contractor; or, in the case of an official responsible for enforcing the fire code concerning fire escapes and exterior stairways, shall be a structural engineer or an employee with a certified fire escape inspection company certified by the Commissioner of Community in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner.  A subcode official shall, pursuant to any subcode which [he] the official administers, pass upon: (1)   matters relative to the mode, manner of construction or materials to be used in the erection or alteration of buildings or structures, including fire escapes and exterior stairways, except as to any such matter foreclosed by State approval pursuant to this act, and (2) actual execution of the approved plans and the installation of the materials approved by the State.  The construction official in each municipality shall be the chief administrator of the "enforcing agency."  [He] The person shall have the power to overrule a determination of a subcode official based on an interpretation of a substantive provision of the subcode which such subcode official administers, only if the construction official is qualified to act pursuant to this act as a subcode official for such subcode. [He] The person may serve as subcode official for any subcode which [he] the person is qualified under this act to administer.  A subcode official or municipal engineer may serve as a construction official if otherwise qualified under the provisions of this act.  The municipal enforcing agency shall require compliance with the provisions of the code, of all rules lawfully adopted and promulgated thereunder and of laws relating to the construction, alteration, repair, removal, demolition and integral equipment and location, occupancy and maintenance of buildings and structures, except as may be otherwise provided for. Two or more municipalities may provide by ordinance, subject to regulations established by the commissioner, for the joint appointment of a construction official and subcode official for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the code in the same manner. c.     No person shall act as a construction official or subcode official for any municipality unless the commissioner determines that said person is so qualified, except for the following: (1)   a municipal construction official or subcode official holding office under permanent civil service status, or tenure as otherwise provided by law on the effective date of this act or within one year thereafter and (2) a municipal construction official or subcode official holding office without such permanent civil service status or tenure on the effective date of this act or within one year thereafter; provided said construction official or subcode official not having such permanent civil service status or tenure shall be certified in accordance with this act within four years of the effective date thereof; provided further that a person holding on the effective date of this act a valid plumbing inspector's license from the Department of Health and Senior Services pursuant to Title 26 of the Revised Statutes may serve as a plumbing subcode official and a person holding on the effective date of this act a valid electrical inspector's license from the Board of Public Utilities pursuant to Title 48 of the Revised Statutes may serve as an electrical subcode official.  The commissioner, after consultation with the code advisory board, may authorize the preparation and conducting of oral, written and practical examinations to determine if a person is qualified by this act to be eligible to be a construction official or subcode official or, in the alternative, may accept successful completion of programs of training as proof of qualification within the meaning of this act.  Upon a determination of qualification the commissioner shall issue or cause to be issued a certificate to the construction official or subcode official or trainee stating that [he] the person is so certified.  The commissioner, after consultation with the code advisory board, may establish classes of certification that will recognize the varying complexities of code enforcement in the municipalities within the State.  The commissioner shall, after consultation with the code advisory board, provide for educational programs designed to train and assist construction officials, subcode officials, and technical assistants to these officials in carrying out their responsibilities. Whenever the commissioner is required by the terms of this subsection to consult with the code advisory board and the matter in question concerns plumbing subcode officials, the commissioner shall also consult with the Public Health Council and Commissioner of Health and Senior Services. d.    The commissioner, after consultation with the code advisory board, may periodically require that each construction official, subcode official, and technical assistant demonstrate a working knowledge of innovations in construction technology and materials, recent changes in and additions to the relevant portions of the State Uniform Construction Code, and current standards of professional ethics and legal responsibility; or, in the alternative, the commissioner, after consultation with the code advisory board, may accept successful completion of appropriate programs of training as proof of such working knowledge.

(cf: P.L.1991, c.202, s.8)]1 1[6.  Section 12 of P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-203) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a.  Each enforcing agency in this State shall enforce [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.) in all buildings, structures and premises within its jurisdiction, except owner-occupied buildings used exclusively for dwelling purposes and containing fewer than three dwelling units, subject to the control and supervision of the commissioner and in accordance with regulations promulgated by the commissioner.  The commissioner shall consult with and advise all local enforcement agencies enforcing the provision of [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.), and each local enforcement agency shall provide the commissioner with reports, data and information required by the commissioner.  To cover the cost to the municipality of conducting inspections under [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.), the municipality may, by ordinance, establish fees, which shall be paid into the treasury of the municipality to which the local enforcing agency is responsible, and which shall be appropriated by the municipality to the local enforcing agency to pay the cost of enforcing [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.). b.    A local enforcing agency consisting of or employing at least one paid fire inspector who is certified pursuant to subsection c. of this section may elect to inspect high-rise structures and life hazard uses within its jurisdiction, including fire escapes and exterior stairways, in lieu of inspection by the commissioner. That election shall be made by resolution of the governing body having jurisdiction over the local enforcing agency.  If an appropriate resolution has not been received by the commissioner on or before the effective date of [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.), the department shall perform all inspections under this subsection until such time as the governing body shall adopt and send to the commissioner an appropriate resolution.  A local enforcing agency that elects to inspect high-rise structures and life hazard uses may issue the certificates of inspection required to be issued pursuant to section 14 of [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-205) and may inspect buildings and premises other than high-rise structures and life hazard uses in order to secure compliance with [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.). c.     The commissioner shall certify fire inspectors under [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.), including inspectors who shall be responsible for conducting compliance inspections of fire escapes and exterior stairways, in accordance with such standards as [he] the commissioner shall establish by regulation; provided that a fire inspector certificate shall be issued by the commissioner to any person who: on the effective date of [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.) is, and for at least one year prior to the effective date of [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.) has been, serving as a fire inspector in the fire service; or shall have, within two years of the effective date of [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.), successfully completed an educational program such as the basic fire prevention code course offered by the Building Officials and Code Administrators International or a recognized equivalent, a fire prevention course offered by an institution of higher education or recognized fire school which has been approved by the commissioner.
