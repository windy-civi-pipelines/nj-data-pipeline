<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Certified employer&quot;

coverage, as that term is defined in 26 U.S.C. s.5000A(f)(1), to an applicable
eligible individual employed by the certified employer; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   fulfills the eligibility

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  The director shall
establish and administer a program to provide tax incentives to certified
employers for the hiring and continued employment of eligible individuals with
developmental disabilities.  The director is authorized to allocate up to
$2,000,000 of tax credits for the program for each calendar year beginning on
the January 1 next following enactment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    To participate in the
program, an employer shall, in a form prescribed by the director, apply
annually to the division by January 15 to claim the credit based on eligible
individuals hired and employed during the preceding calendar year.  As part of
the application, the employer shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) agree to allow the
Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to share the employers
tax information with the division, provided that any information shared

shall not be subject to P.L.1963, c.71 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   allow the division and
its agents access to limited and specific information necessary to monitor
compliance with program eligibility requirements, provided that information
accessed pursuant to this paragraph shall be confidential by law and
privileged, shall not be subject to P.L.1963, c.71 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), and
shall only be used for the stated purpose of this section; and</p>

the information necessary, including the number of hours worked by any eligible
individual, for the director to compute an actual amount of credit allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     After reviewing an
employers application and finding it sufficient, the director shall issue a
tax credit certificate to an employer by March 31.  Each certificate shall
include, but not be limited to, the name and employer identification number of
the certified employer, the amount of credit that the certified employer may
claim, and any other information as deemed necessary by the Director of the
Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1)  Unless otherwise
required pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a certified employer
shall be entitled to a tax credit in an amount equal to the product of $1 and
the number of hours worked by each eligible individual for the certified
employer in this State during that eligible individual's period of employment. 
The credit shall not be allowed unless the eligible individual has worked in
the State for a minimum of 500 hours for the certified employer, and the credit
shall not exceed $2,000 per eligible individual employed by the certified
employer.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In determining the
amount of a tax credit that any employer may claim, the director shall review
all applications submitted for tax credits under the program and, to the extent
that the total amount claimed by certified employers exceeds the amount
allocated for the program in that calendar year, shall issue credits on a pro
rata basis corresponding to each certified employer's share of the total
claimed amount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     (1)  A certified
employer may claim a credit for each eligible employee during the period
starting on the day the employee is hired and ending on December 31 of the
immediately succeeding calendar year or the last day of the employee's
employment by the certified employer, whichever comes first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a
program to incentivize the hiring and continued employment of individuals with
developmental disabilities.  The bill authorizes the Director of the Division
of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Human Services to allocate
up to $2,000,000 of tax credits for the program for each calendar year
beginning on the January 1 next following the bills date of enactment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the director
would be required to administer the program, which would provide corporation business
tax and gross income tax credits to certified employers for hiring and
employing individuals with developmental disabilities in the State.  The bill
defines developmental disability as a severe, chronic disability that: (1) is
attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental or
physical impairments; (2) is manifest before age 22; (3) is likely to continue
indefinitely; (4) results in substantial functional limitations in an area of
major life activity; and (5) reflects the need for a combination and sequence
of special interdisciplinary or generic care, treatment, or other services that
are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and
coordinated.  Developmental disability includes, but is not limited to, severe
disabilities attributable to an intellectual disability, autism, cerebral
palsy, epilepsy, spina bifida, or other neurological impairments where the
above criteria are met.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To participate in the program,
an employer is required to apply annually to the Division of Developmental
Disabilities in the Department of Human Services to claim a tax credit based on
the number of hours worked by eligible individuals hired and employed by the
employer during the preceding calendar year.  The director is required to issue
a tax credit certificate to certified employers by March 31 of each year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a certified
employer would be entitled to a tax credit equal to the product of $1
multiplied by the number of hours worked by each eligible individual hired and
employed by the certified employer during that individual's period of
employment, provided that a credit is not allowed unless the individual has
worked in the State for a minimum of 500 hours for the employer.  To satisfy
this requirement, an employer may elect to either: (1) compute and claim the
credit for the calendar year based on an eligible individuals hours worked by
December 31 of that year, provided that the individual has worked in excess of
500 hours between the date of hire and December 31; or (2) include those hours
worked by the eligible individual in the computation of the credit in the year
immediately succeeding the year in which the individual was hired, in which
case the credit would be computed on the basis of all hours worked by the
individual from the date of hire to the earlier of the last day of employment
or December 31 of the year immediately succeeding the individuals date of
hire.  However, to the extent that the total amount claimed by all certified
employers exceeds the amount allocated for the program in a calendar year, the
director would be required to issue credits on a pro rata basis corresponding
to each certified employers share of the total claimed amount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits certified
employers from claiming a tax credit for hours worked by an eligible individual
in excess of 2,000 hours, and caps the amount of the credit at $2,000 per
eligible individual.  In addition, the bill prohibits employers from claiming a
tax credit more than once with respect to any eligible individual, and
prohibits employers from aggregating the hours worked by two or more eligible
individuals to reach the minimum number of hours required under the program.</p>
