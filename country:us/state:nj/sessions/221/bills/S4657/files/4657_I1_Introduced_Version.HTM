STATEMENT This bill modifies reimbursements paid under the School Employees Health Benefits Program (SEHBP) for premium charges under Part B and Part D of the federal Medicare program. Medicare Part B is part of Traditional Medicare, which provides hospital insurance (Part A) and medical insurance (Part B), or coverage for outpatient medical services, to beneficiaries.  Medicare Part D adds optional prescription drug benefits coverage to Traditional Medicare.  The bill eliminates reimbursements for income-related monthly adjustment amounts (IRMAA), or income-based surcharges, assessed to federal Medicare beneficiaries beyond Medicare Part B and Part D premiums whose reported income meets certain criteria.  By law, the State pays all or a portion of reimbursement costs for Medicare premiums for qualified retirees who receive healthcare coverage in retirement from the SEHBP. The Governors Fiscal Year 2026 budget recommendations include enactment of legislation to eliminate income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA) reimbursements for premium charges under Part B and Part D of the federal Medicare program under the SEHBP.  The Department of the Treasury estimates that this bill will increase revenue for Fiscal Year 2026 by $35 million.
