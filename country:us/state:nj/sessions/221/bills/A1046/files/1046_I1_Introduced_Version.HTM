STATEMENT This bill provides corporation business tax and gross income tax credits for employing immediate family members of members of the Armed Forces of the United States who were killed in action.

The credit is nonrefundable, but may be carried forward for up to 20 tax years.  The bill prohibits taxpayers from simultaneously using family members to qualify for the bills credit and any other generally available employment incentive that comes in the form of a State tax credit or grant.  The bill also empowers the Director of the Division of Taxation to recapture credit due to noncompliance. The bill schedules the credits to become available for tax years beginning on or after the January 1 first following the date of enactment.
