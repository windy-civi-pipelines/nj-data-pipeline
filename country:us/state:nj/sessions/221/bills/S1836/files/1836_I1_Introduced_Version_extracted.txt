(d)   A permit authorizing a vehicle to be equipped with a lamp capable of or displaying a flashing light, except as provided in 39:3-54 or a light of a color other than permitted by this section, visible from directly in front of said vehicle, may be issued by the director when necessary, in his discretion, for the reasonable and safe movement of traffic.  The permit shall specify the type and color of such lamp and the conditions under which a person may drive or move the vehicle with said lamp displaying a light.  The permit shall be valid only when the specifications and conditions contained therein are complied with.  The chief administrator shall collect a $25 fee for the initial issuance and for each subsequent renewal of the permit for each vehicle for which the applicant seeks to use such a light, provided, however, that no fee shall be charged for a permit authorizing the use of a light that is red or blue.  The fee set forth in this section shall not apply to a motor vehicle registered at no fee pursuant to R.S.39:3-27. The fees collected pursuant to this section shall be considered revenue of the commission and shall not be subject to the calculation of proportional revenue remitted to the commission pursuant to section 105 of P.L.2003, c.13 (C.39:2A-36). The chief administrator may cancel or revoke a permit issued under authority of this section whenever the conditions for its issuance no longer exist or on any other reasonable grounds. (cf: P.L.2007, c.242, s.5) 7.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the thirteenth month after enactment, provided however, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission may take such anticipatory action as needed for the acts timely implementation. STATEMENT This bill creates a new motor vehicle registration for street rods and custom motor vehicles.  The bill defines a street rod as a  motor vehicle that was manufactured prior to 1948, or after 1948 but was manufactured in a manner to resemble a vehicle manufactured prior to 1949; and has been altered from the manufacturers original design, or the body of the motor vehicle has been constructed from non-original parts.  Custom motor vehicles are defined under the bill as a motor vehicle that: 1)    is at least 25 years old and of a model year after 1948, or was manufactured to resemble a vehicle 25 years old and of a model year after 1948; and 2)    has been altered from the manufacturer original design, or the body of the motor vehicle has been constructed from non-original parts. Under the provisions of the bill, an applicant for a custom motor vehicle is required to certify in writing that the vehicle will not be used for general transportation, but may be used for activities, including but not limited to, occasional transportation, exhibitions, club activities, parades, and tours.   The bill also provides that the chief administrator of the motor vehicle commission is to certify, authorize, and issue a certificate of ownership to the owner of a custom motor vehicle or street rod, provided that the owner submits proof that the vehicle qualifies as a street rod or custom motor vehicle.  Under the bill, the year of manufacture and model year stated on the certificate of ownership is to be the year of manufacture and model year that the street rod or custom motor vehicle resembles. The bill requires that the phrase Replica-Custom Motor Vehicle or Replica-Street Rod be conspicuously printed at the top of the certificate of ownership. The bill further requires the chief administrator to issue special license plates for street rods and custom motor vehicles.  The chief administrator, in consultation with representatives from the National Street Rod Association, is to choose the design, including an emblem and a color scheme of the license plates.  The bill provides that the application for a license plate shall be accompanied by a fee of $50, payable to the motor vehicle commission.  The owner of a street rod or custom motor vehicle is required to pay $10 annually for the use of the special license plate. In addition, the provisions of the bill provide that a street rod or custom motor vehicle is exempt from regular inspections under the law.  These vehicles also would be exempt from having specific equipment added or affixed to the vehicle that was not required under State law following the year of manufacture listed on the vehicles certificate of ownership. Finally, the bill provides that a street rod or custom vehicle may be equipped with a blue dot tail light as a rear reflector, turn signal or stop lamp.  The bill defines blue dot tail light as a red lamp installed in the rear of a motor vehicle containing a blue or purple insert that is not more than one inch in diameter.
