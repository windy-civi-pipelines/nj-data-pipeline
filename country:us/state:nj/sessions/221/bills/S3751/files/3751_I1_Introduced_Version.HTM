contractor, or volunteer, whether compensated or uncompensated, of an
institution responsible for the care or supervision of that person, as
regulated by the Department of Children and Families (department), including
employees of day schools.  The bill also amends the definition of &quot;abused

the term will also apply to persons between 18 and 21 years of age.</p>

department and forwards all investigatory materials and findings to the
department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill will transfer full
investigatory responsibility to the department for the populations served and
settings regulated by the department, which is accomplished by revising
definitions and other provisions in the statute pertaining to the department
and child abuse to reflect the full range of ages under the departments
jurisdiction for persons up to 21 years of age in regulated facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also updates section
3 of P.L.2010, c.5 (C.30:6D-75) to eliminate conflicting and superfluous
