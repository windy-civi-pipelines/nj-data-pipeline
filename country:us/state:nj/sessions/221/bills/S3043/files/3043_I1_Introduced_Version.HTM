(cf: P.L.1991, c.521, s.19) 10.  Sections 6 and 10 of P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.64 and C.13:1E-68) are repealed. 11.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would revise the provisions of the "Dry Cell Battery Management Act," P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.59 et seq.) to expand the types of batteries and consumer products that are covered under this law. The bill would amend most of the provisions of the "Dry Cell Battery Management Act" to provide that the law would apply to "covered batteries," rather than to mercuric oxide batteries, nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries and sealed lead rechargeable batteries, as in current law.  The bill would define a "covered battery" as a rechargeable or non-rechargeable battery that weighs up to 25 pounds or a rechargeable battery that stores up to 2000 watt-hours of energy, whether embedded in a product or sold separately.  This would entail, among other things, that persons would be prohibited from selling a covered battery or a battery-embedded product unless the manufacturer of the battery or product, as applicable, has developed a battery management plan, which has been approved by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).  The bill would require each manufacturer of a covered battery to submit a battery management plan to the DEP no later than nine months after the bill's enactment.  The bill would also modify the provisions of the "Dry Cell Battery Management Act" to prohibit the use of curbside recycling for the collection of covered batteries, and to require additional items be included in a battery management plan, including a requirement that each manufacturer provide for at least one permanent collection site for used, portable, covered batteries within a 15-mile radius of no less than 95 percent of the residents of the State, and within a 25-mile radius of each resident of the State. The bill would delete a provision of current law that requires retailers to accept used nickel-cadmium and sealed lead rechargeable batteries from customers.  The bill would also delete a provision in current law that requires retailers to post certain signage regarding nickel-cadmium and sealed lead rechargeable batteries in their retail establishments.  In addition, the bill would repeal section 6 of P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.64), which prohibits persons from selling certain rechargeable consumer products, unless certain conditions are met, including that the rechargeable battery is readily removable from the product.

(pending before the Legislature as this bill) (cf: P.L.1991, c.521, s.14) 8.    Section 15 of P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.73) is amended to read as follows: 15.  a.  Every institutional generator shall provide for the on-site source separation, collection, and disposal of all used [mercuric oxide batteries, nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries and sealed lead rechargeable] covered batteries generated at the facility. b.  Every small quantity generator shall provide for the on-site source separation, collection, and disposal of all used [mercuric oxide batteries, nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries and sealed lead rechargeable] covered batteries generated at the facility. c.  Except as otherwise provided in rules or regulations adopted by the department pursuant to P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), or as otherwise prescribed under any other applicable federal or State law, every institutional or small quantity generator shall source-separate used [mercuric oxide batteries, nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries and sealed lead rechargeable] covered batteries for collection and disposal in the manner provided in the battery management plan required pursuant to section 8 of [this act] P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.66). (cf: P.L.1991, c.521, s.15) 9.    Section 19 of P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.77) is amended to read as follows: 19.  a.  The commissioner shall establish a means of addressing consumer complaints and a public education program to assure the widespread dissemination of information concerning the purpose of [this act] P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.59 et seq.). b.  The department shall have the right to enter, at any time during normal business hours and upon presentation of appropriate credentials, any retail establishment at which [consumer mercuric oxide batteries, nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries or sealed lead rechargeable] covered batteries are sold or offered for promotional purposes in order to determine compliance with the provisions of [this act] P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.59 et seq.). (cf: P.L.1991, c.521, s.19) 10.  Sections 6 and 10 of P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.64 and C.13:1E-68) are repealed. 11.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would revise the provisions of the "Dry Cell Battery Management Act," P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.59 et seq.) to expand the types of batteries and consumer products that are covered under this law. The bill would amend most of the provisions of the "Dry Cell Battery Management Act" to provide that the law would apply to "covered batteries," rather than to mercuric oxide batteries, nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries and sealed lead rechargeable batteries, as in current law.  The bill would define a "covered battery" as a rechargeable or non-rechargeable battery that weighs up to 25 pounds or a rechargeable battery that stores up to 2000 watt-hours of energy, whether embedded in a product or sold separately.  This would entail, among other things, that persons would be prohibited from selling a covered battery or a battery-embedded product unless the manufacturer of the battery or product, as applicable, has developed a battery management plan, which has been approved by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).  The bill would require each manufacturer of a covered battery to submit a battery management plan to the DEP no later than nine months after the bill's enactment.  The bill would also modify the provisions of the "Dry Cell Battery Management Act" to prohibit the use of curbside recycling for the collection of covered batteries, and to require additional items be included in a battery management plan, including a requirement that each manufacturer provide for at least one permanent collection site for used, portable, covered batteries within a 15-mile radius of no less than 95 percent of the residents of the State, and within a 25-mile radius of each resident of the State. The bill would delete a provision of current law that requires retailers to accept used nickel-cadmium and sealed lead rechargeable batteries from customers.  The bill would also delete a provision in current law that requires retailers to post certain signage regarding nickel-cadmium and sealed lead rechargeable batteries in their retail establishments.  In addition, the bill would repeal section 6 of P.L.1991, c.521 (C.13:1E-99.64), which prohibits persons from selling certain rechargeable consumer products, unless certain conditions are met, including that the rechargeable battery is readily removable from the product.
