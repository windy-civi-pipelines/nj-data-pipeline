In addition, prior to any interview or interrogation of the officer, the investigator shall inform that officer, orally and in writing, that if as a result of the interview or interrogation the officer should become the subject of an administrative investigation that officer shall be immediately notified and advised of all rights, privileges and protections under this act or any other law. 10. a.  Any communication between a State law enforcement officer and an employee representative shall be deemed privileged and the employee representative shall not be required or compelled to disclose that communication in any action or proceeding against the officer, or in any action or proceeding to review a determination made in any action or proceeding against the officer. b.    The privilege afforded under this section may be disclosed if: (1)   authorized by the officer who made the communication; (2)   the officer reveals an intention to commit a crime or violent act, or where the officer may have committed a crime outside his duties and employment as a law enforcement officer; or (3)   the officer waives the privilege when bringing an action against an employee representative or employee organization and that action involves a privileged communication between the officer and the employee representative. c.     The privilege afforded under this section may be claimed by the officer or the spouse, guardian, conservator or executor of the officer if that officer is deceased or permanently incapacitated. 11.  Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of an investigation conducted pursuant to this act, the person in charge of the investigation, or  his designee, shall notify the officer who was the subject of the investigation, in writing, of the investigative findings and recommendations for disciplinary action.  A failure to notify the officer in accordance with the time limitations set forth in this section shall require a dismissal, with prejudice, of the complaint. 12.  Not later than 15 days following the receipt of a notice required under the provisions of section 11 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and before the filing of any charge seeking the discipline of the officer who was the subject of the investigation or the commencement of any disciplinary proceeding, the officer who was the subject of the investigation may submit a written response to the findings and recommendations set forth in the notice. The response so submitted may include reference to additional documents, physical objects, witnesses or any other information that the officer believes may constitute exculpatory evidence. 13. a.  An officer shall be entitled to a disciplinary hearing prior to the imposition of any disciplinary action.  The subject officer may request that the hearing be held before an impartial arbitrator. Any such request shall be made within 10 days of the receipt of the notice required under the provisions of section 11 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). The disciplinary hearing shall commence within 30 days of the receipt of the notice required under the provisions of section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  A failure to commence a disciplinary hearing in accordance with the time limitations set forth in this section shall require a dismissal of the complaint and the officer shall be returned to duty without prejudice. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, an officer may be suspended immediately, prior to a hearing, when it is determined: (1)   The officer is unfit for duty or is a hazard to any person if permitted to remain on the job, or that an immediate suspension is necessary to maintain the safety, health, order or effective direction of the department, its officers, employees, facilities or the inmates in its custody and care; or (2)   The officer is formally charged with a crime of the first, second or third degree, or a crime of the fourth degree directly associated with the performance of his official duties. An officer suspended pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be suspended without pay until the case against the officer is disposed of at trial, the complaint is dismissed or the prosecution is terminated. c.     If a suspended officer is found not guilty at trial, the charges are dismissed or the prosecution is terminated, that officer shall be reinstated to his position and shall be entitled to recover any pay withheld during the period of suspension, subject to any disciplinary proceedings or administrative action.  All such withheld pay shall be paid to the officer within 30 days of the date on which the officer was found not guilty at trial, the charges were dismissed or the prosecution terminated.  An officer who does not receive all such withheld pay within that 30-day period may seek relief in Superior Court. 14.  The date, time and location of a disciplinary hearing shall be established by the department, commission or agency employing the officer, in consultation with the officer charged or his counsel or representative. 15.  Unless waived in writing by the officer charged, or his counsel or representative, the officer shall, at least 15 days prior to the commencement of the disciplinary hearing, be provided with: a.     A complete copy of the investigation leading to the disciplinary hearing, and any related documents, reports, records or statements; b.    The names and addresses of each witness scheduled to testify at the disciplinary hearing; and c.     An inventory of all physical evidence.

All such lost or deferred pay shall be paid to the officer within 30 days of the date on which the officer was found not guilty of any alleged violation by the disciplinary hearing officer.  An officer who does not receive all such lost or deferred pay within that 30-day period may seek relief in Superior Court. 22.  An officer who is aggrieved by any finding or determination by a disciplinary hearing officer may appeal that finding or determination to the Commissioner of Personnel or the Merit System Board, as appropriate.  The appeal, which shall be filed within 20 days after the aggrieved officer received notice of the disciplinary hearing officer's finding or determination, shall be in writing, signed by the appellant or his representative, set forth the reason for the appeal and the specific relief requested. All appeals shall be filed in the manner and form prescribed by the officers employing department, commission or agency, law, rule or regulation. 23.  An officer who is notified, pursuant to section 4 or 5 of   P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) that he is under investigation or is the subject of a charge may waive in writing any right or procedure accorded under this act. 24.  A State law enforcement officer shall be granted time off with pay to attend any administrative or disciplinary proceeding or any proceeding before the Office of Administrative Law, the Merit System Board or the Public Employment Relations Commission where that officer has been named a party or is called as an essential witness.  The time off granted shall include a reasonable allowance for travel. a.     A State law enforcement officer shall have the right to receive, review and rejoin any material which adversely reflects upon the officer or his employment.  No such material shall be incorporated into the officers personnel file, official work history or any other such compilation of employment or personnel information unless the subject officer has been afforded the opportunity to review and rejoin the material.  An officer refusing to receive, review and, if so inclined, rejoin such material shall not prohibit the incorporation of that material into the officers personnel file, official work history or any other such compilation of employment or personnel information. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, material which adversely reflects upon an officer or his employment may be incorporated in that officers personnel file, official work history or any other such compilation of employment or personnel information if the officer refuses to receive that information for review.  The serving authority shall notify the officers employee representative of any such refusal in writing within three days.  Four days thereafter, the material may be incorporated in the officers file, work history or other such compilation. 25.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to preempt or supersede any provision in a mutually agreed-upon collective agreement that provides for substantially similar or greater rights, privileges and protections than those afforded State law enforcement officers in this act. 26.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fifth month following enactment; except that the affected departments, commissions and agencies may take anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill, to be known as the "State Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights," establishes specific rights, privileges and protections for State law enforcement officers, including State correction officers who are subject to charges which, after investigation, might lead to disciplinary hearings and actions. The bill sets time frames for the commencement of investigations of complaints.  If the complaint is initiated by a private citizen or inmate, the investigation must begin within 15 days of the date the complaint is received. If the complaint is brought by the department, commission or agency employing the officer, a disciplinary hearing must be scheduled no less than 10 days, or more than 30 days, from the date the complaint was served on the officer. Violations of departmental, commission or agency rules or regulations must be filed no more than 45 days after the day on which the person filing the charge reasonably becomes aware of the violation.  A complaint must be dismissed if it is not filed within these time frames. Among the procedural rights and protections State law enforcement officers are afforded under this bill are:  (1) notice of the nature and scope of the investigation or charges; (2) 24-hour advance notice before an officer subject to investigation may be questioned; (3) right to counsel, or an employee representative, during questioning; (4) records of all questioning periods; and (5) assurance that no officer is required to submit to a lie detector test as part of any investigation. Charges must be filed within 30 days of the conclusion of any investigation.  A failure to comply with this requirement will result in the dismissal of all charges. No disciplinary action may be taken against an officer until that officer has been afforded a hearing. Notwithstanding that requirement, an officer who is charged with a crime, and who is found to be unfit for duty or is a danger to any person if permitted to remain on the job, may be suspended without a hearing.  An officer may also be suspended without a hearing if he is formally charged with a crime or if immediate suspension is needed to maintain the safety, health or order of the department, commission or agency employing the officer.  An officer who is formally charged with a crime is to be suspended without pay.  If, however, he is found not guilty, the charges are dismissed or the prosecution is terminated, that officer is to receive all back pay within 30 days of that disposition. If the disciplinary hearing officer finds or determines that a charged officer is not guilty:  (1) the matter is deemed concluded and all charges are dismissed; (2) no disciplinary action may be taken against the officer; (3) no record of, or reference to, the charge for which the officer was found not guilty shall be made part of the officer's personnel file; (4) the officer is to be reinstated to his position; and (5) the officer is entitled to any pay or benefits lost or deferred during the disposition of the charge.  The officer is also entitled to any longevity pay, seniority or any other emolument or benefit to which he was entitled under law or collective agreement. All lost or deferred pay is to be paid to the officer within 30 days. Any officer who is aggrieved by a determination or finding of a disciplinary hearing officer has the right to appeal to the Commissioner of Personnel or the Merit System Board, as is appropriate. The provisions of this bill do not apply to State Police officers and troopers.

If at any time during an interview or interrogation conducted as part of an administrative investigation, the officer subject to that investigation refuses to respond to a question, citing the protections afforded under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the interview or interrogation shall be discontinued and the investigator shall forthwith notify the Attorney General or the county prosecutor, as appropriate. b.    If the Attorney General or county prosecutor, as the case may be, grants immunity, the investigator shall so advise the subject officer in writing.  The investigator, orally and in writing, shall also advise the subject officer that the immunity applies solely to any criminal offense, not any departmental or administrative hearings or actions and, further, that a failure on the part of the subject officer to fully cooperate in the affected administrative investigation, interview or interrogation may result in disciplinary charges, including termination for cause. The advisory information required in writing under this subsection shall be recorded on a form which the subject officer shall sign in front of two witnesses, who also shall sign the form. The signed form shall be made a part of the investigative file and thereupon the administrative investigation, interview or interrogation shall continue. 8.    a.  An investigator may provide for an audio, video or stenographic recording, or any combination thereof, of any administrative interview or interrogation.  A copy of any such recordings shall be made available to the subject officer at no cost. b.    Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a subject officer from providing for an audio, video or stenographic recording, or any combination thereof, of any administrative interview or interrogation.  A copy of any such recordings shall be made available to the department, or the State, as the case may be, at cost. 9.    Whenever a State law enforcement officer is called as a witness in any administrative investigation, the investigator, prior to any interview or interrogation of the officer, shall inform that officer, orally and in writing, of the role, responsibility and protections afforded a witness in an administrative investigation, particularly that a witness is not the subject of an administrative hearing or any disciplinary action arising therefrom. In addition, prior to any interview or interrogation of the officer, the investigator shall inform that officer, orally and in writing, that if as a result of the interview or interrogation the officer should become the subject of an administrative investigation that officer shall be immediately notified and advised of all rights, privileges and protections under this act or any other law. 10. a.  Any communication between a State law enforcement officer and an employee representative shall be deemed privileged and the employee representative shall not be required or compelled to disclose that communication in any action or proceeding against the officer, or in any action or proceeding to review a determination made in any action or proceeding against the officer. b.    The privilege afforded under this section may be disclosed if: (1)   authorized by the officer who made the communication; (2)   the officer reveals an intention to commit a crime or violent act, or where the officer may have committed a crime outside his duties and employment as a law enforcement officer; or (3)   the officer waives the privilege when bringing an action against an employee representative or employee organization and that action involves a privileged communication between the officer and the employee representative. c.     The privilege afforded under this section may be claimed by the officer or the spouse, guardian, conservator or executor of the officer if that officer is deceased or permanently incapacitated. 11.  Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of an investigation conducted pursuant to this act, the person in charge of the investigation, or  his designee, shall notify the officer who was the subject of the investigation, in writing, of the investigative findings and recommendations for disciplinary action.  A failure to notify the officer in accordance with the time limitations set forth in this section shall require a dismissal, with prejudice, of the complaint. 12.  Not later than 15 days following the receipt of a notice required under the provisions of section 11 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and before the filing of any charge seeking the discipline of the officer who was the subject of the investigation or the commencement of any disciplinary proceeding, the officer who was the subject of the investigation may submit a written response to the findings and recommendations set forth in the notice. The response so submitted may include reference to additional documents, physical objects, witnesses or any other information that the officer believes may constitute exculpatory evidence. 13. a.  An officer shall be entitled to a disciplinary hearing prior to the imposition of any disciplinary action.  The subject officer may request that the hearing be held before an impartial arbitrator. Any such request shall be made within 10 days of the receipt of the notice required under the provisions of section 11 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). The disciplinary hearing shall commence within 30 days of the receipt of the notice required under the provisions of section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  A failure to commence a disciplinary hearing in accordance with the time limitations set forth in this section shall require a dismissal of the complaint and the officer shall be returned to duty without prejudice. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, an officer may be suspended immediately, prior to a hearing, when it is determined: (1)   The officer is unfit for duty or is a hazard to any person if permitted to remain on the job, or that an immediate suspension is necessary to maintain the safety, health, order or effective direction of the department, its officers, employees, facilities or the inmates in its custody and care; or (2)   The officer is formally charged with a crime of the first, second or third degree, or a crime of the fourth degree directly associated with the performance of his official duties. An officer suspended pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be suspended without pay until the case against the officer is disposed of at trial, the complaint is dismissed or the prosecution is terminated. c.     If a suspended officer is found not guilty at trial, the charges are dismissed or the prosecution is terminated, that officer shall be reinstated to his position and shall be entitled to recover any pay withheld during the period of suspension, subject to any disciplinary proceedings or administrative action.  All such withheld pay shall be paid to the officer within 30 days of the date on which the officer was found not guilty at trial, the charges were dismissed or the prosecution terminated.  An officer who does not receive all such withheld pay within that 30-day period may seek relief in Superior Court. 14.  The date, time and location of a disciplinary hearing shall be established by the department, commission or agency employing the officer, in consultation with the officer charged or his counsel or representative. 15.  Unless waived in writing by the officer charged, or his counsel or representative, the officer shall, at least 15 days prior to the commencement of the disciplinary hearing, be provided with: a.     A complete copy of the investigation leading to the disciplinary hearing, and any related documents, reports, records or statements; b.    The names and addresses of each witness scheduled to testify at the disciplinary hearing; and c.     An inventory of all physical evidence. No less than 10 days before the disciplinary hearing, the department shall establish a reasonable date, time, place and manner for the officer, or his counsel or representative, to examine all the physical evidence. 16.  An officer subject to a disciplinary hearing shall be entitled to due process, including, but not limited to: a.     The right to be represented by counsel or  a representative; b.    The right to confront and examine witnesses against the officer; and c.     The right to call and examine witnesses on behalf of the officer. 17.  The hearing officer or impartial arbitrator, as the case may be, may provide for an audio, video or stenographic recording, or any combination thereof, of the hearing.  A copy of any such recording shall be made available to the subject officer at no cost. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a subject officer from providing for an audio, video or stenographic recording, or any combination thereof, of any hearing.  A copy of any such recording shall be made available to the officers employing department, commission or agency, or the State, as the case may be, at cost. 18.  The disciplinary hearing officer or impartial arbitrator, as the case may be, shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and documentary evidence on behalf of either the department or the officer who is the subject of the hearing.  The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction to enforce any such subpoena. 19.  A disciplinary hearing shall be closed to the public unless the officer who is the subject of the hearing requests, in writing, that the hearing be open to specified individuals or the general public. 20.  The disciplinary hearing officer or impartial arbitrator, as the case may be, shall administer an oath or affirmation to each witness, whose testimony shall be governed by N.J.S.2C:28-2. 21. a.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the disciplinary hearing officer or impartial arbitrator, as the case may be, shall render a written final decision on each charge within 20 days. b.    If the disciplinary hearing officer finds that the officer who is the subject of the hearing is guilty of any alleged violation, appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken against the officer. c.     If the disciplinary hearing officer finds that the officer who is the subject of the hearing is not guilty of any alleged violation: (1)   The matter shall be deemed concluded and the allegations dismissed; (2)   No disciplinary act shall be taken against the officer; (3)   No record of, nor any reference to, the charge for which the officer was found not guilty shall be made part of the officer's personnel file; (4)   The officer shall be reinstated to his position; and (5)   Any pay or benefits lost or deferred during the disposition of the charge shall be restored to the officer as though no charge had ever been filed against that officer, including pay, vacation, holidays, longevity pay, seniority, and any other emolument or benefit to which that officer was entitled under law or collective agreement. All such lost or deferred pay shall be paid to the officer within 30 days of the date on which the officer was found not guilty of any alleged violation by the disciplinary hearing officer.  An officer who does not receive all such lost or deferred pay within that 30-day period may seek relief in Superior Court. 22.  An officer who is aggrieved by any finding or determination by a disciplinary hearing officer may appeal that finding or determination to the Commissioner of Personnel or the Merit System Board, as appropriate.  The appeal, which shall be filed within 20 days after the aggrieved officer received notice of the disciplinary hearing officer's finding or determination, shall be in writing, signed by the appellant or his representative, set forth the reason for the appeal and the specific relief requested. All appeals shall be filed in the manner and form prescribed by the officers employing department, commission or agency, law, rule or regulation. 23.  An officer who is notified, pursuant to section 4 or 5 of   P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) that he is under investigation or is the subject of a charge may waive in writing any right or procedure accorded under this act. 24.  A State law enforcement officer shall be granted time off with pay to attend any administrative or disciplinary proceeding or any proceeding before the Office of Administrative Law, the Merit System Board or the Public Employment Relations Commission where that officer has been named a party or is called as an essential witness.  The time off granted shall include a reasonable allowance for travel. a.     A State law enforcement officer shall have the right to receive, review and rejoin any material which adversely reflects upon the officer or his employment.  No such material shall be incorporated into the officers personnel file, official work history or any other such compilation of employment or personnel information unless the subject officer has been afforded the opportunity to review and rejoin the material.  An officer refusing to receive, review and, if so inclined, rejoin such material shall not prohibit the incorporation of that material into the officers personnel file, official work history or any other such compilation of employment or personnel information. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, material which adversely reflects upon an officer or his employment may be incorporated in that officers personnel file, official work history or any other such compilation of employment or personnel information if the officer refuses to receive that information for review.  The serving authority shall notify the officers employee representative of any such refusal in writing within three days.  Four days thereafter, the material may be incorporated in the officers file, work history or other such compilation. 25.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to preempt or supersede any provision in a mutually agreed-upon collective agreement that provides for substantially similar or greater rights, privileges and protections than those afforded State law enforcement officers in this act. 26.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fifth month following enactment; except that the affected departments, commissions and agencies may take anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill, to be known as the "State Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights," establishes specific rights, privileges and protections for State law enforcement officers, including State correction officers who are subject to charges which, after investigation, might lead to disciplinary hearings and actions. The bill sets time frames for the commencement of investigations of complaints.  If the complaint is initiated by a private citizen or inmate, the investigation must begin within 15 days of the date the complaint is received. If the complaint is brought by the department, commission or agency employing the officer, a disciplinary hearing must be scheduled no less than 10 days, or more than 30 days, from the date the complaint was served on the officer. Violations of departmental, commission or agency rules or regulations must be filed no more than 45 days after the day on which the person filing the charge reasonably becomes aware of the violation.  A complaint must be dismissed if it is not filed within these time frames. Among the procedural rights and protections State law enforcement officers are afforded under this bill are:  (1) notice of the nature and scope of the investigation or charges; (2) 24-hour advance notice before an officer subject to investigation may be questioned; (3) right to counsel, or an employee representative, during questioning; (4) records of all questioning periods; and (5) assurance that no officer is required to submit to a lie detector test as part of any investigation. Charges must be filed within 30 days of the conclusion of any investigation.  A failure to comply with this requirement will result in the dismissal of all charges. No disciplinary action may be taken against an officer until that officer has been afforded a hearing. Notwithstanding that requirement, an officer who is charged with a crime, and who is found to be unfit for duty or is a danger to any person if permitted to remain on the job, may be suspended without a hearing.  An officer may also be suspended without a hearing if he is formally charged with a crime or if immediate suspension is needed to maintain the safety, health or order of the department, commission or agency employing the officer.  An officer who is formally charged with a crime is to be suspended without pay.  If, however, he is found not guilty, the charges are dismissed or the prosecution is terminated, that officer is to receive all back pay within 30 days of that disposition. If the disciplinary hearing officer finds or determines that a charged officer is not guilty:  (1) the matter is deemed concluded and all charges are dismissed; (2) no disciplinary action may be taken against the officer; (3) no record of, or reference to, the charge for which the officer was found not guilty shall be made part of the officer's personnel file; (4) the officer is to be reinstated to his position; and (5) the officer is entitled to any pay or benefits lost or deferred during the disposition of the charge.  The officer is also entitled to any longevity pay, seniority or any other emolument or benefit to which he was entitled under law or collective agreement. All lost or deferred pay is to be paid to the officer within 30 days. Any officer who is aggrieved by a determination or finding of a disciplinary hearing officer has the right to appeal to the Commissioner of Personnel or the Merit System Board, as is appropriate. The provisions of this bill do not apply to State Police officers and troopers.
