of real property due to State action pursuant to certain laws, amending and
supplementing P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), and supplementing Title 20
of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  Sections
1 through 7 of this act shall be known, and may be cited, as the &quot;New Jersey
Property Rights Protection Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The right to own real
property is essential to the existence of a free and strong democratic society,
and reasonable and limited regulatory controls on the development of real
property are essential to ensure the protection of unwarranted and
inappropriate development by one landowner that would unfairly impinge on the
rights of other landowners or jeopardize the health or safety of New Jersey's
citizens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Actions taken by the
Department of Environmental Protection, the Pinelands Commission, and other
State bureaucracies to regulate the development of real property have often
been excessive and unreasonable and have significantly and unfairly diminished
the value of real property owned by individuals, thereby eroding substantial
lifetime investments, individual freedom, and economic independence; and the
Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council has been empowered to
stringently regulate land use in much of the Highlands Region.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The United
  States Supreme Court and the New Jersey Supreme Court have both held that,
unless the value of real property is reduced to virtually nothing by the action
or actions of the State, there is no governmental obligation to compensate the
property owner for that lost value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The New Jersey Supreme
Court has even gone so far as to hold that restricting a property owner in the
pinelands area to developing his or her land at a rate of one residential unit
per 40 acres does not necessarily constitute a taking and, therefore, does not
require payment of any compensation to the affected property owner even though
significant lifetime investments may have been virtually destroyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The costs associated
with seeking compensatory relief through judicial intervention is prohibitively
expensive, time-consuming, and unpredictable, given the unclear, contradictory
vague rulings of the courts as to the meaning and application of the
&quot;takings&quot; clauses of the United States Constitution and the New
Jersey Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The open and democratic
legislative process is the appropriate forum to debate and establish the level
of regulation that may be forced upon property owners by the State without the
State being required to pay compensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    It is therefore
appropriate for the State to compensate any property owner whose property is
diminished in value by 20% or more as a result of an action or actions taken by
the State, and to require the Attorney General to establish standards for the
adoption of regulations in order to ensure that the State does not adopt
regulations that constitute a regulatory taking of private property as
established by the courts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  As used
in sections 1 through 7 of this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Environmental law&quot;
means R.S.12:5-1 et seq.; &quot;The Wetlands Act of 1970,&quot; P.L.1970, c.272
(C.13:9A-1 et seq.); the &quot;Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act,&quot;
P.L.1987, c.156 (C.13:9B-1 et seq.); the &quot;Hackensack Meadowlands Reclamation
and Development Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.404 (C.13:17-1 et seq.); the
&quot;Pinelands Protection Act,&quot; P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.); the

Act,&quot; P.L.1962, c.19 (C.58:16A-50 et seq.); or any amendment or supplement
to any of those laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Fair market value&quot;
means the most probable price at which real property would be sold, in a
competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale,
between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither of whom is under any
compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant
facts, at the time the State action occurs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Property&quot; or
&quot;real property&quot; means privately owned land, or any right, easement,
or other interest therein, and all structures located thereon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;State action&quot; means
enactment of an environmental law, adoption of a rule or regulation pursuant to
an environmental law, an administrative application or interpretation by a
State agency of such a rule or regulation, or an action of a State agency to
grant, deny, modify, suspend, or revoke a license, permit, certificate,
approval, registration, or other form of permission required by an
environmental law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;State agency&quot; means
the Department of Environmental Protection, the Highlands Water Protection and
Planning Council, the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission, or the Pinelands
Commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Tax lot&quot; means a
single entry on the property tax list of a municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    (New section)  a.  The
State shall compensate the owner of real property whose use of all or any
portion of that property has been limited by State action, occurring during the
time of ownership, that diminishes the fair market value of the entire property
by 20 percent or more.  The amount of the compensation shall equal the
diminution in fair market value that resulted from the State action.  If the
diminution in the fair market value of the property is greater than 50%, at the
option of the owner the State shall purchase the entire property, or the
affected portion thereof as designated by the owner, for its fair market
value.  For purposes of calculating the percentage diminution in fair market
value pursuant to this subsection, at the option of the property owner, the
property at issue may be considered as one parcel regardless of the number of
contiguous tax lots comprising that parcel, or each such component tax lot may
be considered to be a separate parcel from all of the other contiguous tax lots
owned by that person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Real property with
respect to which compensation has been paid under this act shall not thereafter
be used contrary to the limitation imposed by the State action, even if that
action is later rescinded or otherwise vitiated.  If, however, that action is
later rescinded or otherwise vitiated, and the property owner refunds the
amount of the compensation paid, adjusted for inflation, to the General Fund of
the State of New Jersey, the property may be used contrary to the limitation
imposed by the State action.  An inflation adjustment required pursuant to this
subsection shall be an amount equal to the percentage increase in the consumer
price index for all urban consumers in the New York and Philadelphia areas as
reported by the United States Department of Labor, from the date of payment of
compensation by the State to the property owner to the date of payment of the
refund of the amount of compensation by the property owner to the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)  A person may apply
for compensation pursuant to this act only while the person still owns the
parcel of real property that was subject to the State action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   An owner of real
property may not apply for compensation pursuant to this act for a State action
that occurred prior to ownership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    For the purposes of
sections 1 through 7 of this act, the use of real property shall be deemed
&quot;limited&quot; if a particular legal right to use that property no longer
exists because of the State action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    (New section)  a.  An
owner of real property seeking compensation under this act shall make a written
request for compensation to the State agency whose action resulted in the
limitation on the use of the property.  If the State action for which compensation
is sought is the enactment of an environmental law, the owner of the real
property shall make the written request to the State agency with statutory
responsibility for administering the environmental law at issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The State agency may
bargain with the property owner to establish the amount of compensation.  If
the State agency and the owner agree to the amount of compensation, the State
Treasurer shall promptly pay it to the property owner from funds from the
annual appropriation to the State agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If, within 180 days
after the written request is made by the property owner, the State agency and
the property owner do not reach an agreement as to the right to and amount of
compensation, the property owner may choose to submit two appraisals conducted
by two different real estate appraisers, who are licensed by the State Real
Estate Appraiser Board pursuant to P.L.1991, c.68 (C.45:14F-1 et seq.), showing
the percentage and absolute diminution in fair market value of the property
attributable to the State action, and the average of the two  appraisals of the
absolute diminution in fair market value attributable to the State action, and
an amount equal to the property owner's cost in obtaining the two appraisals,
shall be paid promptly by the State Treasurer to the property owner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1)  Any payment made
pursuant to this section to a property owner shall, notwithstanding the
provisions of any other law, be made by the State Treasurer from such funds as
may be made available therefor pursuant to an annual appropriation by the
Legislature to the applicable State agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   If insufficient funds
exist for the payment of compensation, the head of the State agency shall enter
into a memorandum of understanding with the property owner that shall provide
that the State action leading to the diminution in fair market value of the
real property shall not be applied, implemented, or enforced, as the case may
be, with respect to that property, notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation
to the contrary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    (New section)  Whenever
a State agency takes an action pursuant to an environmental law that results in
limiting the use of real property, the State agency shall give appropriate
notice to the affected property owners explaining their rights under this act
and the procedures for obtaining any compensation that may be due to them under
this act.  With respect to the proposal or adoption of any rule or regulation
pursuant to an environmental law that may limit the use of real property, at a
minimum such notice shall be published in the New Jersey Register at the time
the rule or regulation is proposed or adopted, as the case may be.  Notice
shall also be included in every application form for a license, permit,
certificate, approval, registration, or other form of permission required by an
environmental law.</p>

Nothing in this act shall be construed to limit any right of compensation that
exists under the New Jersey Constitution, any other State law, the United
States Constitution, or any federal law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Payment of compensation
under this act, other than when the property is purchased by the State at the
option of the property owner, shall not confer any rights on the State other
than the limitation on use resulting from the State action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    (New section) The
Attorney General shall establish guidelines that shall be used by State
agencies in their evaluation of rules prior to their adoption, amendment, or
repeal to assess the potential of a rule to constitute a taking of real
property.  The guidelines shall be based upon the most current law as
articulated by the United States Supreme Court and the New Jersey Supreme
Court.  The Attorney General shall review and, if necessary, update the
guidelines on an annual basis.</p>

exists, it may proceed without prior notice or hearing, or upon any abbreviated
notice and hearing that it finds practicable, to adopt the rule.  The rule

the request with the Office of Administrative Law for publication in the New
Jersey Register. Notice of formal agency action on such petition shall also be

accordance with the time frame set forth in the preceding paragraph, upon
written request by the petitioner, the Director of the Office of Administrative
Law shall order a public hearing on the rule-making petition and shall provide

the agency does not.  If the agency does not provide notice of a hearing within
15 days of the director's notice, the director shall schedule and provide the
public with a notice of that hearing at least 15 days prior thereto.  If the
public hearing is held by the Office of Administrative Law, it shall be

agency regarding the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule. These
recommendations shall be made public.  At the beginning of each hearing, or
series of hearings, the agency, if it has made a proposal, shall present a
summary of the factual information on which its proposal is based, and shall
respond to questions posed by any interested party.  Hearings shall be
conducted at such times and in locations which shall afford interested parties
the opportunity to attend.  A verbatim record of each hearing shall be

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require the
State to compensate any property owner whose use of all or any portion of that
person's property has been limited by State action, occurring during the time
of ownership, that diminishes the fair market value of the entire property by
20 percent or more.  The amount of the compensation would equal the diminution
in fair market value that resulted from the State action.  If the diminution in
the fair market value of the property is greater than 50%, at the option of the
owner the State would be required to purchase the entire property, or the affected
portion thereof as designated by the owner, for its fair market value. For
purposes of calculating the percentage diminution in fair market value pursuant
to the bill, at the option of the property owner, the property at issue may be
considered as one parcel regardless of the number of contiguous tax lots
comprising that parcel, or each such component tax lot may be considered to be
a separate parcel from all of the other contiguous tax lots owned by that
person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines &quot;State
action&quot; to mean enactment of an environmental law, adoption of a rule or
regulation pursuant to an environmental law, an administrative application or
interpretation by a State agency of such a rule or regulation, or an action of
a State agency to grant, deny, modify, suspend, or revoke a license, permit,
certificate, approval, registration, or other form of permission required by an
environmental law; &quot;State agency&quot; to mean the Department of
Environmental Protection, the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council,
the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission, or the Pinelands Commission; and
&quot;environmental law&quot; to mean the waterfront development law, &quot;The
Wetlands Act of 1970,&quot; the &quot;Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act,&quot;
the &quot;Hackensack Meadowlands Reclamation and Development Act,&quot; the
&quot;Pinelands Protection Act,&quot; the &quot;Coastal Area Facility Review
Act,&quot; the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, and the
&quot;Flood Hazard Area Control Act,&quot; or any amendment or supplement to
any of those laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Real property with respect to
which compensation has been paid under the bill could not thereafter be used
contrary to the limitation imposed by the State action, even if that action is
later rescinded or otherwise vitiated.  If, however, that action is later
rescinded or otherwise vitiated, and the property owner refunds the amount of
the compensation paid, adjusted for inflation, to the State, the property could
be used contrary to the limitation imposed by the State action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a person may
apply for compensation pursuant to the bill only while the person still owns
the parcel of real property that was subject to the State action.  Also, an
owner of real property may not apply for compensation pursuant to the bill for
a State action that occurred prior to ownership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would provide that
any payment made pursuant to the bill to a property owner would,
notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, be made by the State Treasurer
from such funds as may be made available therefor pursuant to an annual
appropriation by the Legislature to the applicable State agencies.  If
insufficient funds exist for the payment of compensation, the head of the
affected State agency would be required to enter into a memorandum of
understanding with the property owner that would provide that the State action
leading to the diminution in fair market value of the real property shall not
be applied, implemented, or enforced, as the case may be, with respect to that
property, notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also sets forth
procedures for providing notice of the bill's provisions to affected property
owners and procedures for applying to obtain compensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would also require
that the notice of the adoption, amendment, or repeal of any administrative
rule include an evaluation of the rule's potential to constitute a taking of
real property in violation of the federal and State constitutional provisions
that prohibit the taking of private property for public use without just
compensation.  The bill would require that the Attorney General establish
guidelines for the review of administrative rules that conform to the law as
articulated in the most current United States Supreme Court and Supreme Court
of New Jersey opinions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of this bill
put into action a national trend of state governments, as well as the federal
government, to be more sensitive to the effect of regulations upon the rights
of private property owners.</p>
