<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
requires that no later than December 31, 2022, each motor fuel terminal
facility and wholesaler that sells motor fuel in this State shall be capable,
in the event of a disaster, of operating its motor fuel distribution loading
racks using an alternate generated power source for a minimum of 72 hours.  The
bill further requires that each newly constructed or substantially renovated

emergency responders to provide motor fuel supplies and services at their
gasoline stations to government, medical, critical infrastructure, and other
emergency responders, as well as the general public, during a declared state of
emergency.  Participation in the program would require a pre-certification of
preparedness of the retail dealer by the State Office of Emergency Management
(OEM) to provide emergency motor fuel supplies and services.  The Director of
the State OEM is to establish requirements for pre-certification by no later
than September 1, 2022.  A retail dealer is not to be pre-certified unless that
retail dealer has the on-site capability to provide motor fuel dispensing
services to emergency responders, demonstrates the ability to have the service

gasoline stations are not to be deemed in violation of the curfew and are not
to be penalized for such operation, nor shall the emergency personnel be in

the Director of the State OEM for priority re-supply fueling in order to
continue service to emergency responders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides to a retail
dealer participating in the program a tax credit in an amount equal to 25
percent of the cost of the purchase and installation during the taxable year of
the transfer switch and alternate generated power source required to meet the
certification requirements established by the State OEM.  The total tax credit
to be given to a retail dealer is not to exceed $15,000.</p>
