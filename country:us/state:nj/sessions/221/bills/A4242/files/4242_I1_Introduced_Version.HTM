supplementing chapter 3 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  This act
shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;New Jersey Right to Home Defense
Law.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    Law-abiding people
should have the right to protect themselves, their families and others from
intruders and attackers without fear of prosecution or civil action for acting
in defense of their own well being and the well being of others in their own
homes and residences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The &quot;castle
doctrine&quot; is a long-standing American legal concept arising from English
common law that provides that one's abode is a special area in which one enjoys
certain protections and immunities, that one is not obligated to retreat before
defending oneself against attack, and that one may do so without fear of
prosecution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    Article I of the New
Jersey Constitution guarantees the citizens of this State the rights &quot;of
enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing, and
protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    All citizens and
residents of this State have a right to expect to be unmolested and safe within
their homes and residences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.    No person should be
required, as a point of law, to surrender their personal safety or well being
to the unlawful actions of a criminal, nor to needlessly retreat in the face of
intrusion or attack in their home or residence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     It is, therefore,
altogether fitting and proper, and within the public interest, to ensure that
law-abiding people are justified in protecting themselves, their families and
others from intruders and attackers in their homes and residences, and that
they may do so without fear of prosecution or civil action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    N.J.S.2C:3-4 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2C:3-4.  Use of Force in
Self-Protection.  a.  Use of force justifiable for protection of the person. 
Subject to the provisions of this section and of section 2C:3-9, the use of
force upon or toward another person is justifiable when the actor reasonably
believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting
himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present
occasion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Limitations on
justifying necessity for use of force.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  The use of force is not
justifiable under this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   To resist an arrest
which the actor knows is being made by a peace officer in the performance of
his duties, although the arrest is unlawful, unless the peace officer employs
unlawful force to effect such arrest; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  To resist force used by
the occupier or possessor of property or by another person on his behalf, where
the actor knows that the person using the force is doing so under a claim of
right to protect the property, except that this limitation shall not apply if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)   The actor is a public
officer acting in the performance of his duties or a person lawfully assisting
him therein or a person making or assisting in a lawful arrest;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)  The actor has been
unlawfully dispossessed of the property and is making a reentry or recaption
justified by section 2C:3-6; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii)  The actor reasonably
believes that such force is necessary to protect himself against death or
serious bodily harm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The use of deadly force
is not justifiable under this section unless the actor reasonably believes that
such force is necessary to protect himself against death or serious bodily
harm; nor is it justifiable if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The actor, with the
purpose of causing death or serious bodily harm, provoked the use of force
against himself in the same encounter; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  The actor knows that he
can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating
or by surrendering possession of a thing to a person asserting a claim of right
thereto or by complying with a demand that he abstain from any action which he
has no duty to take, except that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)   The actor is not obliged
to retreat from his dwelling, unless he was the initial aggressor; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)  A public officer
justified in using force in the performance of his duties or a person justified
in using force in his assistance or a person justified in using force in making
an arrest or preventing an escape is not obliged to desist from efforts to
perform such duty, effect such arrest or prevent such escape because of
resistance or threatened resistance by or on behalf of the person against whom
such action is directed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Except as required by
paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, a person employing protective force
may estimate the necessity of using force when the force is used, without
retreating, surrendering possession, doing any other act which he has no legal

entered a home or residence; or (3) has removed, or is attempting to unlawfully
remove another, against that person's will, from a home or residence; or (4)

a defendant who is wrongly subject to a civil action.</p>
