<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  a.  With respect to the
sale of a mortgaged premises under foreclosure action, each sheriff in this
State shall provide for, but not be limited to, the following uniform
procedures:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Bidding in the name of
the assignee of the foreclosing plaintiff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   That adjournment of the
sale of the foreclosed property shall be in accordance with N.J.S.2A:17-36.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   (a)  The sheriff shall
conduct a sale within 150 days of the sheriff's receipt of any writ of
execution issued by the court in any foreclosure proceeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   If it becomes apparent
that the sheriff cannot comply with the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this
paragraph (3), the foreclosing plaintiff may apply to the office for an order
appointing a Special Master to hold the foreclosure sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Upon the foreclosing
plaintiff making such application to the office, the office shall issue the
appropriate order appointing a Special Master to hold the foreclosure sale. The
office may issue the order to appoint a Special Master to hold foreclosure
sales for one or more properties within a vicinage.</p>

plainly states on its exterior that the envelope is a notice for the sale of
the foreclosed upon residential property.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(5)   (a)  That notice of
the final upset price for the sale of a foreclosed upon residential property be
provided at least four weeks prior to the sheriffs sale and posted on the
Internet website of the sheriffs office and on any other medium used to
provide notice of the sheriffs sale.  The final upset price provided on the
day of the sheriffs sale shall not differ from the final upset price provided
in the notice; and </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(b)   Prior to providing
the final upset price to the sheriffs office pursuant to subparagraph (a) of
this paragraph, the foreclosing plaintiff or agent of the foreclosing plaintiff
shall be prohibited from contacting the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin
of the foreclosed upon defendant, or a nonprofit community development
corporation to inquire whether the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin, or
nonprofit community development corporation intends to participate in the
sheriffs sale for the foreclosed upon property or exercise the provisions of
P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(6)   Prior to the sale of
residential property, the foreclosing plaintiff shall disclose, if known,
whether the property is vacant, tenant-occupied, or owner-occupied.  If the
property is vacant, the</u> <u>foreclosing plaintiff shall provide the
successful bidder access to the property if the foreclosing plaintiff has such
access and may condition access by the successful bidder on being accompanied
by a representative of the foreclosing plaintiff.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(7)   (a) Except as
otherwise provided in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph,</u> the
successful bidder at the sheriff's sale shall pay a 20 percent deposit in
either cash or by a certified or cashier's check, made payable to the sheriff
of the county in which the sale is conducted, immediately upon the conclusion
of the foreclosure sale. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(b)   In the case of
residential property in which the successful bidder is the foreclosed upon
defendant, next of kin, tenant, nonprofit community development corporation, or
a bidder who shall occupy the property as the bidders primary residence for a
period of at least 84 months, the successful bidder who has fulfilled the
requirements set forth in subsection e. of this section shall pay a 3.5 percent
deposit with the rest of the balance due within 90 business days by cash,
certified or cashiers check, or by wire transfer, made payable to the sheriff
of the county in which the sale is conducted or to the Special Master, if the
sheriff cannot comply with the provisions of subparagraph (a) of paragraph (3)

and the sheriff shall immediately void the sale and proceed further with the
resale of the premises without the necessity of adjourning the sale, without
renotification of any party to the foreclosure and without the republication of
any sales notice.  Upon such resale, the defaulting bidder shall be liable to
the foreclosing plaintiff for any additional costs incurred by such default
including, but not limited to, any difference between the amount bid by the
defaulting bidder and the amount generated for the foreclosing plaintiff at the
resale.  In the event the plaintiff is the successful bidder at the resale, the
plaintiff shall provide a credit for the fair market value of the property
foreclosed.</p>

upon defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant for the
initial sale of the foreclosed upon property, unless the sale is delayed,
postponed or concludes with the foreclosing plaintiff purchasing the property,
upon which the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon
defendant, or tenant will receive a right of first refusal for the subsequent
sale of the foreclosed upon property.  Such right will be deemed exercised if,
prior to the opening of the bidding on the foreclosed property, the foreclosed
upon defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant pays a
3.5 percent deposit with the rest of the balance due within 90 business days by
cash, certified or cashiers check, or by wire transfer, made payable to the
sheriff of the county in which the sale is conducted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the foreclosed upon
defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant of the
foreclosed upon property fails to secure financing or assets sufficient to meet
the terms offered by the foreclosing plaintiff or an alternative financial
institution to purchase the residential property, the foreclosed upon
defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant may request
that a nonprofit community development corporation purchase the property.  If
the nonprofit community development corporation agrees in writing to purchase
the property from the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed
upon defendant, or tenant, the corporation will have a right of second refusal
to purchase the property which is subordinate to the first right of refusal
provided to a foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin of the foreclosed upon
defendant, or tenant.  If the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin of the
foreclosed upon defendant, or tenant decides not to participate in the sheriffs
sale, enter into an agreement with the corporation, or fail to secure financing
or assets sufficient to meet the terms offered by the foreclosing plaintiff or
an alternative financial institution to purchase the property, a nonprofit
community development corporation will have the right of second refusal to
purchase the property in the amount approved for the opening bid of the
sheriffs sale at the time of the sale.  The right shall be deemed exercised
if, prior to the opening of the bidding on the foreclosed property, the
corporation pays a 3.5 percent deposit with the rest of the balance due within
90 business days by cash, certified or cashiers check, or by wire transfer,
made payable to the sheriff of the county in which the sale is conducted or to
the Special Master, if the sheriff cannot conduct the sale.  A nonprofit
community development corporation will only have a right of second refusal to
purchase the property if it satisfies certain conditions set forth within the
bill.</p>

conducted pursuant to the Community Wealth Preservation Program, the bill
increases the fee to be charged by virtue of an execution sale from 4 to 5
percent, or 6 percent to 10 percent, depending on whether the sum involved is
greater than or less than $5,000, respectively.  The bill also increases the
minimum fee to be charged by virtue of an execution sale from $50 to $150. </p>
