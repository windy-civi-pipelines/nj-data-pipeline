Flexible pavement.  A pavement not less than 10 inches in depth consisting of five-inch macadam base, three-inch modified penetration macadam and three-inch bituminous concrete surface course or other pavements of equivalent strength, in accordance with the findings of the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) Road Test, 20 years. Class B:  Mixed surface-treated road.  An eight-inch surface of gravel, stone or other selected material under partial control mixed with cement or lime and fly ash, six inches in compacted thickness with bituminous surface treatment and cover, 10 years.

"Electric vehicle" means any passenger car, station wagon, or other motor vehicle that is propelled solely by an electric motor or energy storage device. "Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle" means any passenger car, station wagon, or other motor vehicle that is propelled by power derived from one or more cells that convert chemical energy directly into electricity by combining oxygen with hydrogen fuel. "Plug-in hybrid vehicle" means any passenger car, station wagon, or other motor vehicle that can be charged from a source of electricity external to the vehicle through an electric plug, but which is not solely powered by electricity. (cf:  P.L. 2021, c.267, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would permit counties and municipalities to issue bonds to acquire certain environmentally friendly passenger cars and station wagons. Under current law, counties and municipalities may only issue bonds to finance certain projects having a period of usefulness of at least five years.  Additionally, the Local Bond Law, N.J.S.40A:2-1 et seq., specifically excludes passenger cars and station wagons from the category of newly purchased automotive vehicles that are deemed to have a maximum period of usefulness of five years. The bill would amend this exclusion in the Local Bond Law in order to allow permit counties and municipalities to bond for passenger cars and station wagons that are solely fueled by a battery or equivalent energy storage device charged from an electricity supply external to the vehicle or by a renewable power source.  Other passenger cars and station wagons would continue to be excluded.
