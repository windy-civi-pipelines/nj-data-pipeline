(4)   The superintendent shall issue to an approved retired officer an identification card permitting the retired officer to carry a handgun pursuant to this subsection.  This identification card shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance and shall be valid throughout the State.  The identification card shall not be transferable to any other person.  The identification card shall be carried at all times on the person of the retired officer while the retired officer is carrying a handgun.  The retired officer shall produce the identification card for review on the demand of any law enforcement officer or authority. (5)   Any person aggrieved by the denial of the superintendent of approval for a permit to carry a handgun pursuant to this subsection may request a hearing in the Superior Court of New Jersey in the county in which the person resides by filing a written request for a hearing within 30 days of the denial.  Copies of the request shall be served upon the superintendent and the county prosecutor.  The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the filing of the request, and no formal pleading or filing fee shall be required.  Appeals from the determination of the hearing shall be in accordance with law and the rules governing the courts of this State. (6)   A judge of the Superior Court may revoke a retired officer's privilege to carry a handgun pursuant to this subsection for good cause shown on the application of any interested person.  A person who becomes subject to any of the disabilities set forth in subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:58-3 shall surrender, as prescribed by the superintendent, the person's identification card issued under paragraph (4) of this subsection to the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality wherein the person resides or the superintendent, and shall be permanently disqualified to carry a handgun under this subsection. (7)   The superintendent may charge a reasonable application fee to retired officers to offset any costs associated with administering the application process set forth in this subsection. m.   Nothing in subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:39-5 shall be construed to prevent duly authorized personnel of the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, while in the actual performance of duties, from possessing, transporting or using any device that projects, releases or emits any substance specified as being non-injurious to wildlife by the Director of the Division of Animal Health in the Department of Agriculture, and which may immobilize wildlife and produces only temporary physical discomfort through being vaporized or otherwise dispensed in the air for the purpose of repelling bear or other animal attacks or for the aversive conditioning of wildlife. n.    Nothing in subsection b., c., d. or e. of N.J.S.2C:39-5 shall be construed to prevent duly authorized personnel of the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, while in the actual performance of duties, from possessing, transporting or using hand held pistol-like devices, rifles or shotguns that launch pyrotechnic missiles for the sole purpose of frightening, hazing or aversive conditioning of nuisance or depredating wildlife; from possessing, transporting or using rifles, pistols or similar devices for the sole purpose of chemically immobilizing wild or non-domestic animals; or, provided the duly authorized person complies with the requirements of subsection j. of this section, from possessing, transporting or using rifles or shotguns, upon completion of a Police Training Commission approved training course, in order to dispatch injured or dangerous animals or for non-lethal use for the purpose of frightening, hazing or aversive conditioning of nuisance or depredating wildlife. (cf: P.L.2019, c.407, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill eliminates the age restriction governing the issuance of permits to carry handguns to retired law enforcement officers. Currently, retired law enforcement officers may receive a permit to carry a handgun without having to establish justifiable need until they have attained the age of 75. This bill eliminates that age limitation.

STATEMENT This bill eliminates the age restriction governing the issuance of permits to carry handguns to retired law enforcement officers. Currently, retired law enforcement officers may receive a permit to carry a handgun without having to establish justifiable need until they have attained the age of 75. This bill eliminates that age limitation.
