The Director of the Division of Taxation is authorized to do all things necessary to implement the withholding tax prescribed by this section for taxable year 2018. e.     No additions to tax or penalty shall be imposed under N.J.S.54A:9-6 for insufficient payment of estimated tax that may otherwise be due on salaries, wages and other remuneration received before September 1, 2018, on which there is a rate of tax imposed pursuant to subsections a. and b. of this section. f.     An employer maintaining an office or transacting business within this State and making payment of any salaries, wages and remuneration subject to New Jersey gross income tax or making payment of any remuneration for employment subject to contribution under the New Jersey "unemployment compensation law," pursuant to R.S.43:21-1 et seq., that is subject to New Jersey gross income tax shall not be subject to interest, penalties or other costs that may otherwise be imposed for insufficient withholding of salaries, wages and other remuneration made before September 1, 2018, that is directly attributable to the enactment of the taxable income tables and tax rates in subsections a. and b. of this section. (cf: P.L.2020, c.94, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. STATEMENT This bill modifies certain tax brackets under the New Jersey gross income tax.  Specifically, the bill modifies the income thresholds of the four lowest tax brackets so that many low-income and middle-income taxpayers would be eligible for a lower marginal tax rate. In recent months, record-high inflation has made it more difficult for Americans to afford food, gas, and other critical goods and services.  This bill would help New Jerseyans weather this surge in prices by allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money.

household for federal income tax purposes but for the fact that such taxpayer is a nonresident alien, shall determine tax pursuant to subsection a. of this section. d.    For the purposes of this section, for taxable year 2018, withholding by every employer from salaries, wages and other remuneration paid by an employer for services rendered described in subsections a. and b. of this section, in excess of $5,000,000 during that taxable year, shall be at the rate of 15.6% as soon as practicable but no later than September 1, 2018. The Director of the Division of Taxation is authorized to do all things necessary to implement the withholding tax prescribed by this section for taxable year 2018. e.     No additions to tax or penalty shall be imposed under N.J.S.54A:9-6 for insufficient payment of estimated tax that may otherwise be due on salaries, wages and other remuneration received before September 1, 2018, on which there is a rate of tax imposed pursuant to subsections a. and b. of this section. f.     An employer maintaining an office or transacting business within this State and making payment of any salaries, wages and remuneration subject to New Jersey gross income tax or making payment of any remuneration for employment subject to contribution under the New Jersey "unemployment compensation law," pursuant to R.S.43:21-1 et seq., that is subject to New Jersey gross income tax shall not be subject to interest, penalties or other costs that may otherwise be imposed for insufficient withholding of salaries, wages and other remuneration made before September 1, 2018, that is directly attributable to the enactment of the taxable income tables and tax rates in subsections a. and b. of this section. (cf: P.L.2020, c.94, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. STATEMENT This bill modifies certain tax brackets under the New Jersey gross income tax.  Specifically, the bill modifies the income thresholds of the four lowest tax brackets so that many low-income and middle-income taxpayers would be eligible for a lower marginal tax rate. In recent months, record-high inflation has made it more difficult for Americans to afford food, gas, and other critical goods and services.  This bill would help New Jerseyans weather this surge in prices by allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money.
