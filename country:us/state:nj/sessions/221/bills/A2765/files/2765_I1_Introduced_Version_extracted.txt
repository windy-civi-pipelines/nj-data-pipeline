[For the purposes of this paragraph (3), policies or contracts offered by a carrier to a small employer who is a member of a Small Employer Purchasing Alliance shall be rated separately from the carrier's other small employer health benefits policies or contracts.] (b)   A health benefits plan issued pursuant to subsection j. of section 3 of P.L.1992, c.162 (C.17B:27A-19) shall be rated in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of P.L.1995, c.340 (C.17B:27A-19.3), for the purposes of meeting the requirements of this paragraph.

A carrier which provides a health benefits plan to one or more small employers through a policy issued to an association or trust of employers after the effective date of P.L.1992, c.162 (C.17B:27A-17 et seq.), shall be required to offer small employer health benefits plans to non-association or trust employers in the same manner as any other small employer carrier is required pursuant to P.L.1992, c.162 (C.17B:27A-17 et seq.). e.     Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the use of premium rate structures to establish different premium rates for individuals and family units. f.     No insurance contract or policy subject to this act, including a contract or policy entered into with a small employer who is a member of a Small Employer Purchasing Alliance pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2001, c.225 (C.17B:27A-25.1 et al.), may be entered into unless and until the carrier has made an informational filing with the commissioner of a schedule of premiums, not to exceed 12 months in duration, to be paid pursuant to such contract or policy, of the carrier's rating plan and classification system in connection with such contract or policy, and of the actuarial assumptions and methods used by the carrier in establishing premium rates for such contract or policy. g.    (1)  Beginning January 1, 1995, a carrier desiring to increase or decrease premiums for any policy form or benefit rider offered pursuant to subsection i. of section 3 of P.L.1992, c.162 (C.17B:27A-19) subject to this act may implement such increase or decrease upon making an informational filing with the commissioner of such increase or decrease, along with the actuarial assumptions and methods used by the carrier in establishing such increase or decrease, provided that the anticipated minimum loss ratio for all policy forms shall not be less than 80% of the premium therefor as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The commissioner may disapprove any informational filing on a finding that it is incomplete and not in substantial compliance with P.L.1992, c.162 (C.17B:27A-17 et seq.), or that the rates are inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.  Until December 31, 1996, the informational filing shall also include the carrier's rating plan and classification system in connection with such increase or decrease. (2)   Each calendar year, a carrier shall return, in the form of aggregate benefits for all of the standard policy forms offered by the carrier pursuant to subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1992, c.162 (C.17B:27A-19), at least 80% of the aggregate premiums collected for all of the standard policy forms, [other than] including alliance policy forms, and at least 80% of the aggregate premiums collected for all of the non-standard policy forms during that calendar year.  [A carrier shall return at least 80% of the premiums collected for all of the alliances during that calendar year, which loss ratio may be calculated in the aggregate for all of the alliances or separately for each alliance.] Carriers shall annually report, no later than August 1st of each year, the loss ratio calculated pursuant to this section for all of the standard[, other than alliance] policy forms[,] and non-standard policy forms [and alliance policy forms] for the previous calendar year[, provided that a carrier may annually report the loss ratio calculated pursuant to this section for all of the alliances in the aggregate or separately for each alliance]. In each case where the loss ratio fails to substantially comply with the 80% loss ratio requirement, the carrier shall issue a dividend or credit against future premiums for all policyholders with the standard[, other than alliance policy forms,] and nonstandard policy forms [or alliance policy forms], as applicable, in an amount sufficient to assure that the aggregate benefits paid in the previous calendar year plus the amount of the dividends and credits shall equal 80% of the aggregate premiums collected for the respective policy forms in the previous calendar year.  All dividends and credits must be distributed by December 31 of the year following the calendar year in which the loss ratio requirements were not satisfied.  The annual report required by this paragraph shall include a carrier's calculation of the dividends and credits applicable to standard[, other than alliance policy forms,] and non-standard policy forms [and alliance policy forms], as well as an explanation of the carrier's plan to issue dividends or credits. The instructions and format for calculating and reporting loss ratios and issuing dividends or credits shall be specified by the commissioner by regulation.  Such regulations shall include provisions for the distribution of a dividend or credit in the event of cancellation or termination by a policyholder.  For purposes of this paragraph, "alliance policy forms" means policies purchased by small employers who are members of Small Employer Purchasing Alliances. (3)   The loss ratio of a health benefits plan issued pursuant to subsection j. of section 3 of P.L.1992, c.162 (C.17B:27A-19) shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of section 7 of P.L.1995, c.340 (C.17B:27A-19.3), for the purposes of meeting the requirements of this subsection. h.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1993, c.162). i.     The provisions of this act shall apply to health benefits plans which are delivered, issued for delivery, renewed or continued on or after January 1, 1994. j.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1995, c.340). k.    A carrier who negotiates a reduced premium rate with a Small Employer Purchasing Alliance for members of that alliance shall provide a reduction in the premium rate filed in accordance with paragraph (3) of subsection a. of this section, expressed as a percentage, which reduction shall be based on volume or other efficiencies or economies of scale and shall not be based on health status-related factors. (cf: P.L.2008, c.38, s.24) 3.    Section 8 of P.L.2001, c.352 (C.17B:27C-8) is amended to read as follows: 8.    a.  Except as provided by this act, the insurance laws of this State do not apply to the operation of self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangements.  A self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement is not an insurance company or insurer under the laws of this State. b.    Any self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement shall offer all products that it is actively marketing to any employer, and accept any employer and any employee of that employer who applies for any of those products; provided, however that a self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement may limit participation to members of the association. c.     Assessments payable by small employer members, except for dental plans, shall [be established in accordance with the rating requirements of section 9 of P.L.1992, c.162 (C.17B:27A-25) and regulations promulgated thereunder] not be greater than 300 percent of the assessment charged to the lowest rated small employer member of the self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement. d.    (1)  If the member is a small employer, the [health] coverage of mandated hospital and medical benefits [to be] provided by the self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement shall at all times be equal to or greater than the hospital and medical benefits required to be [provided in] covered under the lowest benefit level standard plan promulgated by the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program pursuant to P.L.1992, c.162 (C.17B:27A-17 et seq.) , and shall include coverage of pediatric services, including oral and vision care, as required by the Affordable Care Act, and federal regulations set forth at 45 CFR 156.100, et seq.  The provisions of this subsection shall not require a self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement to provide small employer members with any plan provisions applicable under the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program, other than coverage of mandated hospital and medical benefits. (2)   As used in this subsection: "Affordable Care Act" means the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.L.111-148, as amended by the federal "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," Pub.L.111-152, and any federal rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. Hospital and medical benefits means benefits provided pursuant to P.L.1992, c.162 (C.17B:27A-17 et seq.) that: (a)   cover certain persons or certain illnesses, procedures, or prescription drugs; (b)   require coverage of benefits without or with limited cost-sharing; (c)   require reimbursement of care by certain providers, if the care is a covered expense; or (d)   require coverage of maternity benefits, including prenatal and postnatal care. Plan provisions shall include, but shall not be limited to, any rules, requirements, and payment provisions, including any cost-sharing requirements, designed to implement those plans. e.     A large employer participating in a multiple employer welfare arrangement shall not be required to adhere to the plan or design elements, or any required coverage offerings applicable to small employers, including but not limited to deductibles, co-pays, and co-insurance amounts.  After the effective date of P.L.2015, c.172, large employer members of a multiple employer welfare arrangement shall continue to offer all health benefits mandated by State law and in effect on October 1, 2014.  Any new or additional health benefits mandated by State law required to be offered after October 1, 2014 shall not be required to be offered by large employers participating in a multiple employer welfare arrangement.  Except as provided in P.L.2001, c.352 (C.17B:27C-1 et seq.) as amended by P.L.2015, c.172, multiple employer welfare arrangements with large employers shall be otherwise subject to the requirements of State and federal law. f.     Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, if the member is a large employer, the rate manual used to calculate program rates may include appropriate classification factors such as claims experience and utilization, age, gender, tobacco use, and geography, and such specific underwriting adjustments as may be certified in accordance with subsection d. of section 6 of P.L.2001, c.352 (C.17B:27C-6). g.    The self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement may provide to its members a health and wellness program consistent with the United States Department of Labor's requirements. h.    The self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement may provide to its members an internet-based system for the administration, billing and claims processing of its benefits. (cf: P.L.2015, c.172, s.5.) 4.    This act shall take effect on the 90th day next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill revises certain requirements for individual and small employer health benefits plans and for small employer members of multiple employer welfare arrangements. This bill brings New Jersey statutes that govern the rating factors used by health insurance carriers to charge premiums for health benefits plans in the individual and small employer markets into compliance with certain provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA). Current New Jersey statutes allow premiums for health benefits plans offered in these markets to vary according to certain factors and within certain ranges in ways that are not in compliance with the requirements of the ACA. Specifically, with respect to plans offered through the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage Program, the bill: (1) provides that the premium rate charged by a carrier for the highest rated individual or class of individuals shall not exceed 300%, instead of 350% as provided in current law, of the premium rate charged for the lowest rated individual or class of individuals purchasing the same individual health benefits plan; and (2) requires rate differentials based on age to use classifications established in one-year increments, instead of five-year increments as provided in current law. With respect to plans offered through the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program, the bill: (1) removes gender as a permissible rating factor; (2) eliminates separate rating treatment for small employer purchasing alliances for determining permissible rate differentials between the highest rated and lowest rated plans, and for determining compliance with medical loss ratios; and (3) requires rate differentials based on age to use classifications established in one-year increments, instead of five-year increments as provided in current law. By amending these statutes that govern the offering of individual and small employer plans in the State, the bill brings New Jersey law into conformance with certain provisions of the ACA. With respect to plans offered through the Small Employer Health Benefits Program, the bill also provides that the premium rate charged by a carrier to the highest rated small group purchasing a small employer health benefits plan may not be greater than 300% of the premium rate charged for the lowest rated small group purchasing that same health benefits plan. A multiple employer welfare arrangement, or MEWA, is a self-funded or partially self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement that provides for health benefits plans and that has one or more of the employer members either domiciled in New Jersey or its principal headquarters or principal administrative office located in the State. Under current law, the assessments payable by small employer members of MEWAs are required to be in accordance with the rating requirements of the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program. Pursuant to this requirement, assessments payable by small employer members may not be greater than 200% of the premium rate charged for the lowest rated small employer member.  Under the bill, assessments payable by small employer members would be required to be no greater than 300% of the assessment charged to the lowest rated small employer member of the self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement. The bill also clarifies the requirements for small employer members of MEWAs concerning mandated health benefits.  Under current law, small employer members are required to provide health benefits that are equal to or greater than benefits required to be provided by the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program.  Under the bill, small employer members would be required to provide hospital and medical benefits that are equal to or greater than the hospital and medical benefits required to be provided by the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program.  The bill clarifies that the hospital and medical benefits provided shall include coverage of pediatric services, including oral and vision care, as required by the Affordable Care Act, and maternity benefits, including prenatal and postnatal care. The bill further clarifies the hospital and medical benefits coverage requirement and makes it clear that a self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement is not required to provide small employer members with any plan provisions applicable under the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program other than coverage of mandated hospital and medical benefits.  As used in the bill, plan provisions include, but are not limited to, any rules, requirements, and payment provisions, including any cost-sharing requirements, designed to implement those plans. Finally, the bill requires hospital and medical benefits provided by MEWAs include coverage of pediatric services, including oral and vision care, as required by the Affordable Care Act, and maternity benefits, including prenatal and postnatal care.

STATEMENT This bill revises certain requirements for individual and small employer health benefits plans and for small employer members of multiple employer welfare arrangements. This bill brings New Jersey statutes that govern the rating factors used by health insurance carriers to charge premiums for health benefits plans in the individual and small employer markets into compliance with certain provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA). Current New Jersey statutes allow premiums for health benefits plans offered in these markets to vary according to certain factors and within certain ranges in ways that are not in compliance with the requirements of the ACA. Specifically, with respect to plans offered through the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage Program, the bill: (1) provides that the premium rate charged by a carrier for the highest rated individual or class of individuals shall not exceed 300%, instead of 350% as provided in current law, of the premium rate charged for the lowest rated individual or class of individuals purchasing the same individual health benefits plan; and (2) requires rate differentials based on age to use classifications established in one-year increments, instead of five-year increments as provided in current law. With respect to plans offered through the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program, the bill: (1) removes gender as a permissible rating factor; (2) eliminates separate rating treatment for small employer purchasing alliances for determining permissible rate differentials between the highest rated and lowest rated plans, and for determining compliance with medical loss ratios; and (3) requires rate differentials based on age to use classifications established in one-year increments, instead of five-year increments as provided in current law. By amending these statutes that govern the offering of individual and small employer plans in the State, the bill brings New Jersey law into conformance with certain provisions of the ACA. With respect to plans offered through the Small Employer Health Benefits Program, the bill also provides that the premium rate charged by a carrier to the highest rated small group purchasing a small employer health benefits plan may not be greater than 300% of the premium rate charged for the lowest rated small group purchasing that same health benefits plan. A multiple employer welfare arrangement, or MEWA, is a self-funded or partially self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement that provides for health benefits plans and that has one or more of the employer members either domiciled in New Jersey or its principal headquarters or principal administrative office located in the State. Under current law, the assessments payable by small employer members of MEWAs are required to be in accordance with the rating requirements of the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program. Pursuant to this requirement, assessments payable by small employer members may not be greater than 200% of the premium rate charged for the lowest rated small employer member.  Under the bill, assessments payable by small employer members would be required to be no greater than 300% of the assessment charged to the lowest rated small employer member of the self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement. The bill also clarifies the requirements for small employer members of MEWAs concerning mandated health benefits.  Under current law, small employer members are required to provide health benefits that are equal to or greater than benefits required to be provided by the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program.  Under the bill, small employer members would be required to provide hospital and medical benefits that are equal to or greater than the hospital and medical benefits required to be provided by the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program.  The bill clarifies that the hospital and medical benefits provided shall include coverage of pediatric services, including oral and vision care, as required by the Affordable Care Act, and maternity benefits, including prenatal and postnatal care. The bill further clarifies the hospital and medical benefits coverage requirement and makes it clear that a self-funded multiple employer welfare arrangement is not required to provide small employer members with any plan provisions applicable under the New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program other than coverage of mandated hospital and medical benefits.  As used in the bill, plan provisions include, but are not limited to, any rules, requirements, and payment provisions, including any cost-sharing requirements, designed to implement those plans. Finally, the bill requires hospital and medical benefits provided by MEWAs include coverage of pediatric services, including oral and vision care, as required by the Affordable Care Act, and maternity benefits, including prenatal and postnatal care.
