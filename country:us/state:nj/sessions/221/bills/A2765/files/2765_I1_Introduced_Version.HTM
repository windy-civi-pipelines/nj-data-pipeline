law, of the premium rate charged for the lowest rated individual or class of
individuals purchasing the same individual health benefits plan; and (2)

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;

compliance with medical loss ratios; and (3) requires rate differentials based

New Jersey Small Employer Health Benefits Program.  The bill clarifies that the
hospital and medical benefits provided shall include coverage of pediatric
