(2) generating facilities are not located on the farm pursuant to this section and the facilities authorized by this subsection shall be limited to those associated with the transmission and distribution of energy, along with access to such facilities; (3) the components, facilities, structures, and equipment for any single project are located within a right-of-way not to exceed fifty feet in width located as close as reasonably practical, based on applicable constraints, to the edge of the preserved portion of the farm and are installed by any of the following methods and subject to the following limitations: (a) overhead lines shall be located within the right-of-way, with any disturbance around associated poles and in the work area to be returned as close as reasonably practical to existing conditions after completion of the work; (b) open cut trenches shall be located within the right-of-way with the components to be installed at a depth of greater than three feet below grade, with the trench to be backfilled and with any disturbance in the work area to be returned as close as reasonably practical to existing conditions after completion of the work; (c) the use of a cable plow to cut a narrow trench into the ground and simultaneously lay the cable shall be located within the right-of-way with the components to be installed at a depth of greater than three feet below grade, with any open areas to be backfilled and with any disturbance in the work area to be returned as close as reasonably practical to existing conditions after completion of the work; and (d) the underground bore shall be located within the right-of-way at a depth of greater than three feet below grade; and (4) any improvements or use, including roadway improvements, that require access outside of the right-of-way shall be limited to an additional right-of-way not to exceed fifty feet in width and shall be allowed only when no other access route is reasonably practical.  The additional right-of-way shall be located either: (a) as close as reasonably practical based on applicable constraints to the edge of the preserved portion of the farm;
