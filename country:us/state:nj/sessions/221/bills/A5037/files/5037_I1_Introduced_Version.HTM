<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 1 of P.L.2007,
c.349 (C.19:61-9) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. a. Notwithstanding any law,
rule or regulation to the contrary, the Secretary of State shall appoint each
year an independent, professional audit team.  It shall oversee, in each
county, <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>random
hand-to-eye counts<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>post-election audits</u> of the voter-verifiable paper records that are to
be conducted by appropriate county election officials.  <u>Post-election audits
may be conducted by a hand-to-eye count, or via independent third-party
electronic machines that are not in any way associated with the official ballot
tabulation system for the election.</u>  Audits shall be conducted for each
election held for federal or State office, including the offices of Governor,
Lieutenant Governor and member of the Legislature, and for county and municipal
offices selected by the Secretary of State.  In each county, the audit shall be
conducted in at least two percent of the election districts in which each
audited election appears on the ballot.  County and municipal elections held in
fewer than 100 election districts are exempt from this requirement.  Election
districts that are randomly selected for auditing for either the Congressional
or State legislative elections in alternating years may be used to audit any
other election that appears on the ballot in such districts.  Ballot batches,
as provided for in subsection c. of this section, shall also be audited subject
to the provisions of this section.  In the case of a general election, audits
shall begin 13 days after the election and shall be completed prior to the
certification of the results of that election.  Extensions may be provided by
the Secretary of State if necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The membership and
composition of the audit team shall be at the discretion of the Secretary of
State but shall be not less than four, and at least one member shall have
verifiable expertise in the field of statistics and another member shall have
verifiable expertise in the field of auditing.  No member of the audit team
shall include any person who: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) is serving in any position
on any political campaign committee of any candidate for political office in
the elections that are subject to the manual audit;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) is an employee of, or reports
to, the Secretary of State; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) is serving as an officer
or an employee of any entity that designs, manufactures, or services a voting
system used in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The independent audit
team shall oversee, supervise, and require county election officials to conduct
an audit of the results of an election in accordance with the following
procedures:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) <b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>Any procedure designed, adopted,
and implemented by the audit team shall be implemented to ensure with at least
99% statistical power that for each federal, gubernatorial or other Statewide
election held in the State, a 100% manual recount of the voter-verifiable paper
records would not alter the electoral outcome reported by the audit.  For each
election held for State office, other than Governor and Lieutenant Governor,
and for county and municipal elections held in 100 or more election districts,
any procedure designed, adopted, and implemented by the audit team shall be
implemented to ensure with at least 90% statistical power that a 100% manual
recount of the voter-verifiable paper records would not alter the electoral
outcome reported by the audit.  Such procedures designed, adopted, and
implemented by the audit team to achieve statistical power shall be based upon
scientifically reasonable assumptions, with respect to each audited election,
including but not limited to: the possibility that within any election district
up to 20% of the total votes cast may have been counted for a candidate or
ballot position other than the one intended by the voters; and that the number
of votes cast per election district will vary.  Such<b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>Post-election audit</u>
procedures and assumptions shall be published prior to any given election, and
the public shall have the opportunity to comment thereon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Any procedure designed,
adopted, and implemented by the audit team for each county and municipal
election held in fewer than 100 election districts, but more than a single
election district, shall be conducted in at least two election districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) Within a reasonable period
of time after the final vote count after an election, the Secretary of State,
with the audit team, shall determine and then announce publicly the election
districts in the State in which audits shall be conducted, and within 24 hours
of that announcement, the audit shall be commenced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) With respect to votes cast
at the election district on the date of an election other than by emergency or
provisional ballot, the independent audit team shall oversee and supervise a <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>hand-to-eye
count<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>post-election audit</u> of the voter-verifiable paper records and compare
those records with the count of such votes announced by the county boards of
elections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) With respect to the votes
cast other than at the election district on the date of the election, or any
other votes counted electronically by the county board of elections on or after
the date of the election, including votes cast by military service voters and
overseas federal election voters, the independent audit team shall oversee and
supervise a <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>count
by hand<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>post-election audit</u> of the voter-verifiable paper records as follows. 
To maintain voter privacy, prior to each election, the audit team shall direct
the appropriate county election official to divide the ballots into batches,
hereinafter referred to as audit units.  Each audit unit shall contain
approximately the average number of ballots cast in the election districts
within the county, or fewer, but shall not be associated with any particular
election district.  As the ballots comprising each audit unit are counted
electronically, each audit unit shall be assigned a unique identification
number.  Immediately after counting the ballots comprising each audit unit, a
cumulative summary vote tally report bearing the audit unit's unique identification
number and containing the sum of the vote totals of the audit unit and all
previously counted audit units in the election shall be printed and affixed to
the audit unit.  The reports shall be subject to the same secure chain of
custody as the ballots comprising the audit units and shall be used by the
audit team to determine the electronic vote tally for each audit unit.  The
audit team shall first compare the vote tallies in the final cumulative report
to the official results announced by the county and resolve any discrepancies,
and then include all the audit units from each county in the random selection
process and if selected, cause them to be audited in the same manner provided
herein for election districts <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>,
except that the hand-to-eye count shall be compared to the electronic vote
tally derived from the cumulative reports<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) The selection of the
election districts, audit units, and county and municipal elections to be
audited shall be made by the Secretary of State on a random basis by lot, at a
public meeting, using a uniform distribution in which all election districts in
which an election is held, and county and municipal elections have an equal
chance of being selected, in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary
of State, upon the recommendation of a majority of the audit team, deems
appropriate.  Selection of election districts or audit units for county and
municipal elections held in less than 100 election districts may be made
randomly using a non-uniform distribution to be determined by the Secretary of
State, upon the recommendation of a majority of the audit team.  Such
procedures shall be published prior to use in any given election, and the
public shall have the opportunity to comment thereon.  Notwithstanding the requirements
set forth in this paragraph, the audit team shall have the authority to cause
audits to be conducted of any election district or audit unit which has not
been randomly selected for auditing in which a majority of the audit team
determines from the un-audited election results, past election results, or
other data that the votes are likely to have been miscounted.  The Secretary of
State shall allow members of the public, including but not limited to those
permitted to observe recounts, to observe the audits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7) As soon as practicable
after the completion of an audit conducted pursuant to this section, the
Secretary of State shall announce publicly and publish the results of the audit
and shall include in the announcement a comparison of the results of the
election in the districts, as determined by the independent audit team
performing the audit, and the final vote count in the districts as announced by
the county boards of elections, including a list, by election district and
audit unit, of any discrepancies between the initial vote count and <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>any subsequent
manual<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>the post-election audit</u> counts of the voter-verifiable paper record;
explanations for such discrepancies, if any; and tallies of all overvotes,
undervotes or their equivalents, blank ballots, spoiled ballots, and
cancellations recorded on the voter-verifiable paper record.  If the audit
under this section results in a change in the number of votes counted for any
candidate, the revised vote totals shall be incorporated in the official result
from the relevant election districts or audit units.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   No county shall certify
the results of any election that is subject to an audit performed pursuant to
this section prior to the completion of the audit and the announcement and
publication of the results thereof as required by paragraph (7) of this
subsection.  The audit and publication of the results thereof shall be
completed prior to the time the State shall make a final determination with
respect to any controversy or contest concerning the appointment of its
electors for President or Vice President of the United States prior to the
deadline established in section 6 of Pub.L.80-644 (3 U.S.C.s.6).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9) If the Secretary of State,
based on a recommendation of a majority of the professional audit team,
determines that any of the <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>hand-to-eye<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>post-election
audit</u> counts conducted under this section show cause for concern about the
accuracy of the results of any election in the State, or in a county or a
municipality, or with respect to a particular election, the independent audit
team shall oversee, supervise, and cause to be conducted <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>hand-to-eye counts<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>post-election
audits</u> under this section in such additional election districts or audit
units as the Secretary of State considers appropriate to resolve any such
concerns.  The Secretary of State shall issue previous to any election the
criteria to be employed to determine whether the <b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>hand-to-eye counts<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>post-election

trigger further <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>hand-to-eye
counts<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>action</u>.  Such criteria shall be published prior to use in any given
election, and the public shall have the opportunity to comment thereon. 
Notwithstanding the requirements previously set forth in this paragraph,
additional <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>hand-to-eye<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>post-election
audit</u> counts shall be conducted if in the initial audit conducted pursuant
to the procedures set forth in this subsection, any discrepancy or
discrepancies attributable to the electronic counting system would alter the
vote share of any candidate or ballot position by one tenth of one percent or
more of the <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>hand
counted<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
votes in the sample.  Under such circumstances, the audit of the election shall
be expanded using the same number of election districts and when possible,
audit units, as the initial audit and shall be conducted under the same
procedures used to conduct the initial audit, provided, however, that if the
initial audit comprises more than one half the total number of election districts
and audit units in the election, the expanded audit shall be a full hand-to-eye
count of the remaining un-audited election districts and audit units.  Further
hand-to-eye counts shall be conducted if any discrepancy or discrepancies
attributable to the electronic counting system detected by the initial or
subsequent expanded audit indicates a substantial possibility that a complete
hand-to-eye recount would alter the outcome of the audited election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10) If the voter-verifiable
paper records in any machine are found to be unusable for an audit for any
reason whatsoever, another machine used in the same election shall be selected
at random by the audit team to replace the original machine in the audit
sample.  All such selections shall be made randomly in the presence of those
observing the audit using a method approved by the Secretary of State.  An
investigation to determine the reason the voter-verifiable paper records were
compromised and unusable shall begin immediately, and the results of the
investigation shall be made public upon completion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Nothing in this section
shall be construed to prevent a candidate or other applicant from requesting a
recount pursuant to R.S.19:28-1 et seq. or any other law.  In the event that
such a recount is held in any election district that has been audited pursuant
to this section, the official result from such election district shall be
applied to the recount in lieu of conducting a subsequent hand count of the
audited election district unless a court, at the request of a candidate or
other applicant who requested the recount, so orders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises procedures
governing the audits of election results.  These changes include permitting
post-election audits to be conducted by independent third-party electronic
machines that are not in any way associated with the official ballot tabulation
system for the election in addition to a hand-to-eye count.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill eliminates certain requirements
that audit procedures designed, adopted, and implemented by the audit team be
implemented to ensure certain percentages of statistical power that a 100
percent manual recount of the voter-verifiable paper records would not alter
the electoral outcome reported by the audit.  Instead, post-election audit
procedures will be published prior to elections and will be subject to public
comment.</p>
