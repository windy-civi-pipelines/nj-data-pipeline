<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under P.L.2011, c.202
(C.19:60-1.1 et al.), school districts are permitted to move the annual school
election from the third Tuesday in April to the date of the general election in
November.  Pursuant to that law, when a school district moves the election to
November, the term of office of a school board member that is set to expire in
April of a given year will be extended until the day in January next following
the year in which the term was originally set to expire when the member's
successor takes office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     P.L.2011, c.202 also permits a
district to move the annual school election from the date of the general
election back to the third Tuesday in April.  Under these circumstances, this
bill provides that the term of a school board member that is set to expire in
January next following the year in which the April election occurs will be
shortened.  The term of these board members will expire on the date after the
April election when the new board organizes and the board members successor
takes office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that in
order to move the annual school election from the date of the general election
back to the third Tuesday in April, both the board of education of the local or
regional school district and the governing body of the municipality or
municipalities constituting the district would be required to adopt a
resolution to move the election.  Under current law, a resolution by either the
board of education or the governing body of the municipality would be
sufficient to move the election back to April.  The bill does not alter the
current process that permits the date of the school districts election to be
moved back to April with voter approval.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also makes a
technical amendment to section 1 of P.L.2011, c.202 (C.19:60-1.1).  The
provision is amended to clarify that Type II districts with boards of school
estimate are permitted to move their annual school election date.  These types
of districts are permitted to do so pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2012, c.78 <br>
(C.19:60-1.2).</p>
