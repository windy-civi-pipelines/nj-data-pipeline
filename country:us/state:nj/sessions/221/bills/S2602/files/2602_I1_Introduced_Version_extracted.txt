(cf: P.L.2012, c.78, s.1) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Under P.L.2011, c.202 (C.19:60-1.1 et al.), school districts are permitted to move the annual school election from the third Tuesday in April to the date of the general election in November.  Pursuant to that law, when a school district moves the election to November, the term of office of a school board member that is set to expire in April of a given year will be extended until the day in January next following the year in which the term was originally set to expire when the member's successor takes office. P.L.2011, c.202 also permits a district to move the annual school election from the date of the general election back to the third Tuesday in April.  Under these circumstances, this bill provides that the term of a school board member that is set to expire in January next following the year in which the April election occurs will be shortened.  The term of these board members will expire on the date after the April election when the new board organizes and the board members successor takes office. The bill also provides that in order to move the annual school election from the date of the general election back to the third Tuesday in April, both the board of education of the local or regional school district and the governing body of the municipality or municipalities constituting the district would be required to adopt a resolution to move the election.  Under current law, a resolution by either the board of education or the governing body of the municipality would be sufficient to move the election back to April.  The bill does not alter the current process that permits the date of the school districts election to be moved back to April with voter approval. The bill also makes a technical amendment to section 1 of P.L.2011, c.202 (C.19:60-1.1).  The provision is amended to clarify that Type II districts with boards of school estimate are permitted to move their annual school election date.  These types of districts are permitted to do so pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2012, c.78 (C.19:60-1.2).
