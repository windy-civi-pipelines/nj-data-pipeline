<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  The Department of
Agriculture shall establish a Farm Vitality Planning Reimbursement Grant
Program to reimburse the owners and operators of farms in the State for the
eligible costs incurred in the development and implementation of eligible plans
that are designed to ensure future and long-term farm viability.  The purpose
of the program shall be to enhance the long-term economic stability, viability,
and vitality of farms in the State by facilitating and funding the development
and implementation, by farmers, of sound business plans, strategies, and
practices that are designed to facilitate the diversification or resiliency of
agricultural production, the effective and efficient transfer of farm
ownership, and the strategic expansion of farms and farming operations in the
State.  The department shall be authorized to award grants, under the program,
of up to $7,500 for each eligible plan developed or implemented by the owner or
operator of a farm, in order to reimburse up to 75 percent of the total
eligible costs thereof.  Any remaining costs associated with the development or
implementation of an eligible plan shall be financed by the owner or operator
of the farm through monetary means, rather than in-kind contributions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Grant moneys awarded
pursuant to the Farm Vitality Planning Reimbursement Grant Program shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  be used only to reimburse
the eligible costs that were directly incurred and paid by the grant applicant
in developing or implementing an eligible plan; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  not be used to reimburse
any ineligible costs; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  not be used to reimburse
any eligible costs that are already being paid for or reimbursed with funds
made available from another federal or State grant program.  In any case where
another federal or State agency or program is financing a portion of the
eligible costs incurred by the owner or operator of a farm in the development
or implementation of an eligible plan, the total eligible costs used to
determine the amount of the grant to be awarded, under the Farm Vitality
Planning Reimbursement Grant Program, shall be reduced by the amount of the
federal or State contribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The owner or operator of
a farm who wishes to obtain a grant under the Farm Vitality Planning
Reimbursement Grant Program shall submit an application therefor, in a form and
manner prescribed by the secretary.  The grant application shall include the
following information:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  a statement indicating
the types of eligible plans for which grant reimbursement is being sought,
summarizing each eligible plans purpose and goals, and, to the extent known,
identifying the potential or actual effects of each eligible plan on the farms
future and long-term economic stability, viability, and vitality;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  receipts or other
verifiable documentation certifying the total amount of eligible costs directly
incurred by the applicant for each eligible plan for which reimbursement is
being sought, and demonstrating that those eligible costs were paid by the
applicant within the two year period preceding the date on which the grant
application was submitted, or within another reasonable period of time, as
determined by rule or regulation adopted pursuant to section 5 of this act;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require the
Department of Agriculture (DOA) to establish a Farm Vitality Planning
Reimbursement Grant Program to reimburse the owners and operators of farms in
the State for the eligible costs incurred thereby in the development and
implementation of certain plans that are designed to ensure future and
long-term farm viability.  The DOA would be authorized to award grants, under
the program, of up to $7,500 for each eligible plan that is developed or
implemented by the owner or operator of a farm, in order to reimburse up to 75
percent of the total eligible costs thereof.  Any remaining costs would need to
be financed by the owner or operator of the farm through monetary means, rather
than in-kind contributions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Grant moneys awarded under the
program may be used only to reimburse the eligible costs that were directly incurred
and paid by the grant applicant in developing or implementing an eligible
plan.  An eligible plan is defined by the bill to mean:  (1) a business plan or
management strategy that is specifically designed to enhance a farms long-term
economic stability or viability; (2) a business plan that is specifically
designed to diversify or expand an existing agricultural or horticultural
operation to include new or different forms of agricultural or horticultural
products or new, more efficient, or more sustainable production methods; (3) a
business plan or business expansion plan that is specifically designed to
facilitate the expansion or growth of a farm; (4) a farm ownership transition
plan that is designed to facilitate the efficient transfer of ownership and
operation of a farm to a new owner or operator who is unrelated to the current
owner or operator; (5) a family ownership transition plan that is designed to
facilitate the transfer of ownership and operation of a farm to an immediate
family member or other relative of the farms current owner or operator; or (6)
a preserved farmland maintenance plan that is specifically designed to maintain
and facilitate the long-term economic viability of, or protect the investment
of public funds in, preserved farmland.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Costs would be eligible for
reimbursement under the Farm Vitality Planning Reimbursement Grant Program if
they are directly incurred by the owner or operator of a farm in association
with the hiring, contracting, or employment of any of the following
professionals for the purposes of developing or implementing an eligible plan: 
(1) an accountant, a certified public accountant, a business consultant, or a
financial planner; (2) an appraiser; (3) an attorney; (4) a professional
facilitator; or (5) a professional mediator who is assisting with a farm
succession conflict.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The following costs would be
ineligible for reimbursement under the program:  (1) capital improvement costs;
(2) the costs associated with developing or implementing a conservation plan or
practice, an erosion or sediment control plan, a manure management plan, or a
nutrient management plan; (3) the costs associated with surveying and
subdividing farmland, regardless of whether such costs are related to a farm
succession analysis; (4) State or federal taxes, regardless of whether such
taxes are paid upon the transfer of farmland; (5) insurance premiums and
related insurance costs; and (6) the costs of meals, mileage, and other travel
expenses incurred by the owner or operator of a farm, or by any of the
professionals that are hired to develop or implement the eligible plan.  A
program grant may not be used to reimburse any ineligible costs or any eligible
costs that are already being paid for or reimbursed with funds made available
from another federal or State grant program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Grants under the Farm Vitality
Planning Reimbursement Grant Program would be awarded on a first come, first
served basis, within the limits of available funds, to each owner or operator
of a farm who submits an application therefor, so long as the application
establishes that reimbursement is being sought for eligible costs incurred, by
the applicant, in association with the development or implementation of an
eligible plan.  Among other things, a grant application is to include receipts
or other verifiable documentation certifying the total amount of eligible costs
directly incurred for each eligible plan and demonstrating that those eligible
costs were paid by the applicant within the two year period preceding the date
on which the grant application was submitted, or within another reasonable
period of time, as determined by DOA rule or regulation.  The Secretary of
Agriculture would be required to consider grant applications in the order in
which they were received.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would provide an
initial appropriation of $1 million, from the General Fund, to finance grants
being issued under the program.  The bill would also require the secretary to
annually submit a written program report, to the Governor and Legislature,
which includes program-specific data, as well as a recommendation as to whether
the grant program should be continued in future years, and, if so, a related
recommendation for additional appropriations necessary to ensure the programs
continued operation and success.</p>
