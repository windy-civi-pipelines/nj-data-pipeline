A5692 ASSEMBLY, No. 5692 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 15, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  CLINTON CALABRESE District 36 (Bergen and Passaic) Assemblywoman  MITCHELLE DRULIS District 16 (Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblyman Freiman SYNOPSIS Exempts minor league baseball players from certain State wage laws under certain circumstances. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning wages of minor league baseball players and supplementing P.L.1966, c.113 (C.34:11-56a1 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     On March 29, 2023, the Major League Baseball Players Association, the recognized labor union for Major League Baseball players, entered into a first-ever nationwide collective bargaining agreement with Minor League Baseball on behalf of minor league players. b.    This agreement provides significant compensation and benefits to minor league players, including annual salaries, health care, housing, retirement benefits, meals, and tuition assistance. c.     The unique nature of minor league athletic work, including irregular hours and non-traditional training schedules, makes the application of State wage and hour laws incompatible with the collectively bargained agreement. d.    It is in the interest of the State to respect the terms of a union-negotiated agreement and ensure continued operations of minor league teams that provide community and economic benefits to New Jersey. 2.    a. The provisions of the "New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law," P.L.1966, c.113 (C.34:11-56a et seq.) and the recordkeeping requirements of the State wage payment law, P.L.1965, c.173 (C.34:11-4.1 et seq.) shall not apply to a minor league baseball player who is subject to a collective bargaining agreement entered into between Minor League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association that is in effect and that expressly provides for wages and conditions of the minor league baseball player. b.    The exclusion in subsection a. of this section shall apply only during a period in which an affected minor league baseball player is compensated pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement that meets the requirements of this section and shall not extend beyond the term of that agreement, except that a collective bargaining agreement may be renewed, renegotiated, or extended. c.     Minor League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association shall notify the Department of Labor and Workforce Development of any termination or replacement of a collective bargaining agreement subject to the provisions of this act within one week of any termination or replacement. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately, and shall remain in effect as long as a collective bargaining agreement that meets the requirements of this act remains in effect. STATEMENT This bill exempts minor league baseball players from the provisions of the State wage and hour laws and the recordkeeping requirements of the wage payment laws, provided the players are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that is in effect and expressly governs wages and working conditions. In putting forth this legislation, the sponsor affirms a dual commitment to organized labor and to the economic and social vitality of the New Jersey communities that host minor league baseball teams. The legislation recognizes the important role these teams play as sources of affordable family entertainment, youth engagement, and local economic development, while also respecting the strong labor protections already secured through collective bargaining. In March 2023, the Major League Baseball Players Association, the certified labor union for Major League Baseball players, entered into the first-ever nationwide collective bargaining agreement with Minor League Baseball. This landmark agreement established significant protections for minor league players, including guaranteed annual salaries, health care coverage, housing stipends, retirement benefits, meals, and tuition assistance. Due to the unique nature of minor league baseball employmentmarked by irregular schedules, extensive travel, and non-traditional training demandscertain provisions of State wage and hour laws are incompatible with the terms negotiated by the parties. This bill ensures that the legal framework governing these players remains consistent with the collectively bargained agreement, without undermining its protections or benefits. The exemption established by this bill applies only during the period in which a valid collective bargaining agreement is in effect and expressly provides for the wages and working conditions of the affected players. The bill also requires the league and union to notify the Department of Labor and Workforce Development in the event of the agreements termination or replacement, ensuring continued transparency and accountability. Several other states, including Florida, Indiana, and California, have taken similar steps to harmonize their labor laws with the terms of this collective agreement. This legislation adopts a balanced and narrowly tailored approach that supports players, protects the integrity of organized labor, and sustains the community and economic benefits of minor league baseball across New Jersey.
