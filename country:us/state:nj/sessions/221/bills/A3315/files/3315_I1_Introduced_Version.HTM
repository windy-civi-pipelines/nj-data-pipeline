<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  a. 
Within one year of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill), any school district that is under partial
or full State intervention on the effective date shall be returned to full
local control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Within four months of
the effective date of P.L.    ,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill), the board of education of a
school district that has not had the governance component of school district
effectiveness returned to local control prior to that date shall call a special
election for the purposes of placing the question of classification status
before the voters of the district, which election shall be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes concerning
school elections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   If the voters of the
district elect to become a Type I district, it shall be governed by the
provisions of chapter 9 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes relating to
Type I districts after January 31 next ensuing, unless the district is
established in a city of the first class, in which case it shall be governed
after June 30 next ensuing.  The members of the district board of education at
the time of said election shall continue in office until expiration of their
respective terms and the qualification in office of their successors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   If the voters of the
district elect to become a Type II district, it shall be governed by the
provisions of chapter 9 of Title 18A relating to Type II districts, and the
members of the board of education at the time of said election shall remain and
continue in office until the expiration of their respective terms and the
qualifications of their respective successors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 14 of P.L.1975,
c.212 (C.18A:7A-14) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     14.  a.  The commissioner
shall review the results of the report submitted pursuant to sections 10 and 11
of P.L.1975, c.212 (C.18A:7A-10 and 18A:7A-11) and after examination of all
relevant data, including student assessment data, determine where on the performance
continuum the district shall be placed.  The commissioner, through
collaboration, shall establish a mechanism for parent, school employee and
community resident input into the review process.  If the commissioner finds
that a school district or county vocational school district satisfies 80
percent to 100 percent of the quality performance indicators in each of the
five key components of school district effectiveness, the commissioner shall
issue to the district a letter of recognition designating the district as a
high performing district, provided that the district has submitted to the
department a statement of assurance which attests that the contents of the
report are valid.  The commissioner shall recommend that the State board
certify the school district for a period of three years as providing a thorough
and efficient system of education, contingent on continued progress in meeting
the quality performance indicators. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If a school district
satisfies 50 percent to 79 percent of the quality performance indicators in any
of the five key components of school district effectiveness, the commissioner
shall require the district to develop an improvement plan to address the
quality performance indicators with which the district has not complied and to
increase district capacity through the provision of technical assistance and
other measures designed to meet the district's needs.  The improvement plan
shall be submitted to and approved by the commissioner.  In accordance with the
improvement plan, the commissioner shall provide technical assistance to the
district.  If necessary, the commissioner may authorize an in-depth evaluation
of the district to determine the causes for the district's noncompliance with
the quality performance indicators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner shall review
the district's progress in implementing the improvement plan not less than
every six months.  If the commissioner finds, based on those reviews, that
after two years the district has not satisfied 80 to 100 percent of the quality
performance indicators in each of the five key components of school district
effectiveness, the commissioner may require the district to amend the
improvement plan.  The amended plan shall be submitted to the commissioner for
approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a district effectively
implements its improvement plan and is able to satisfy 80 to 100 percent of the
quality performance indicators in each of the five key components of school
district effectiveness through the interventions set forth in this subsection,
the commissioner shall issue the district a letter of recognition designating
the district as a high performing district.  The commissioner shall recommend
that the State board certify the school district for a period of three years as
providing a thorough and efficient system of education, contingent on continued
progress in meeting the quality performance indicators.  If the district has
not effectively implemented its improvement plan and has not satisfied 80 to
100 percent of the quality performance indicators in each of the five key
components of school district effectiveness through the interventions set forth
in this subsection, the commissioner shall issue the district a letter
detailing the areas in which the district remains deficient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)  If a school district
satisfies less than 50 percent of the quality performance indicators in four or
fewer of the five key components of school district effectiveness, the
commissioner shall authorize an in-depth evaluation of the district's
performance and capacity unless the commissioner determines that a
comprehensive evaluation of the district by or directed by the department has
occurred within the last year.  Based on the findings and recommendations of
that evaluation, the district, in cooperation with the department, shall

which the district has not complied and to increase district capacity through
the provision of technical assistance and other measures designed to meet the

the technical assistance outlined in the plan and shall assure that the
district's budget provides the resources necessary to implement the improvement
plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner shall review
the district's progress in implementing the improvement plan not less than

commissioner finds, based on those reviews, that after two years the district
has not satisfied at least 50% of the quality performance indicators in each of
the key components of school district effectiveness, the commissioner may
require the district to amend the improvement plan. The amended plan shall be
submitted to the commissioner for approval.</p>

Administrative Law pursuant to the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot;
P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), upon said order to show cause, shall be

upon its determining that the school district is not providing a thorough and
efficient system of education, the State board may place the district under
partial State intervention.  Nothing herein shall limit the right of any party
to appeal the State board's order to the Superior Court, Appellate Division. </p>

improvement plan, the commissioner, in consultation with the local board of
education, may appoint one or more highly skilled professionals in a district

to comply.  The highly skilled professional shall represent the interests of
the commissioner in all matters relating to the component of school district
effectiveness that is under intervention and over which the highly skilled
professional is providing direct oversight.  The powers and authorities of the
highly skilled professional shall include, but not be limited to:</p>

operations of the district in the area of intervention over which the highly

more than one highly skilled professional in a district under partial State

The highly skilled professional shall report directly to the commissioner or
his designee on a bi-weekly basis and shall report monthly to the board of
education and members of the public at the regularly scheduled board of
education meeting.  The salary of a highly skilled professional appointed
pursuant to this paragraph shall be fixed by the commissioner and adjusted from
time to time as the commissioner deems appropriate.  The cost of the salaries
of the highly skilled professionals shall be a shared expense of the school
district and the State, with the State assuming one-half of the cost and the

approval the commissioner may appoint up to three additional members to the
board of education of a district under partial State intervention.  The board
of education's membership shall remain increased by these additional seats
until the State withdraws from intervention.  If the commissioner appoints
three additional members pursuant to this paragraph, the commissioner shall
appoint one of these additional members from a list of three candidates
provided by the local governing body of the municipality in which the school
district is located.  The commissioner shall make every effort to appoint
residents of the district.  A board member appointed by the commissioner shall
be a nonvoting member of the board and shall have all the other rights, powers
and privileges of a member of the board.  A board member appointed by the
commissioner shall report to the commissioner on the activities of the board of
education and shall provide assistance to the board of education on such
matters as deemed appropriate by the commissioner, including, but not limited
to, the applicable laws and regulations governing specific school board
action.  A member appointed by the commissioner shall serve for a term of two
years.  The commissioner shall obtain approval of the State board for any
extension of the two-year term.  Any vacancy in the membership appointed by the
commissioner shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment.</p>
