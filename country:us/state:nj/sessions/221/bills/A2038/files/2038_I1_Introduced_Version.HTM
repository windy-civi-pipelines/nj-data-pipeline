<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes various
revisions to the regulation of health service corporations.  The bill clarifies
the charitable role of health service corporations, revises the membership of
the board of directors of health service corporations, establishes a process to
determine an efficient level of surplus, and directs the reduction of surplus
that is in excess of an efficient range.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
provides that a health service corporation shall have a charitable mission to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   fulfill its obligation
as an insurer of last resort in this State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   provide affordable and
accessible health insurance to subscribers; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   assist and support
public and private health care initiatives for individuals without health
insurance;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   promote the integration
of the health care system that meets the health care needs of the residents of
the State of New Jersey; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   acknowledge its
obligation to the residents of this State to make health care coverage
available to underserved markets by supporting and supplying community services
in connection with the provision of health care; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   recognize an ongoing
responsibility to contribute to fundamental improvements in the overall health
status of all New Jersey residents.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, a health service
corporation is directed to develop goals, objectives, and strategies for
carrying out, in accordance with this bill, its statutory mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires a health
service corporation to file on an annual basis, and in a form and manner
prescribed by the Department of Banking and Insurance, information similar to
the information required to be filed by a charitable organization in Internal
Revenue Service Form 990 and Schedule A (990), which information the department
shall post on its website.  This form allows the IRS and the general public to
evaluate a nonprofits operations; it includes information on the nonprofits
mission, programs, and finances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs, on or before
June 30, 2019, and annually thereafter, the commissioner to report to the
Governor, and to the Legislature on the compliance of a health service
corporation with the provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides for
three members of a health service corporation board of directors to be elected
by its qualified voters. Qualified voters are health service corporation
subscribers who are 18 years of age or more, if an individual, and whose
subscription certificate or contract has been in force for at least one year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Regarding a health service
corporations surplus, the bill requires the commissioner to establish a public
process to determine an appropriate, efficient surplus range. The bill requires
a public process, including input from experts, members of the public, and the
health service corporation, to be established to determine an efficient and
appropriate range of surplus for a health service corporation.  Once the public
process, and notification to the health service corporation of the
commissioners determination of the efficient range, is complete, the efficient
surplus range shall remain in effect, provided, however, the commissioner may,
at his discretion initiate a new public process, if the commissioner deems it
necessary to reevaluate the efficient surplus range.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
commissioner to examine the surplus amount and the health service corporations
annual regulatory filings for the prior calendar year on an annual basis to
determine whether the surplus is inefficient.  If a surplus falls above the
established efficient range and the health service corporation cannot justify
the excess, the health service corporation must provide a plan to reduce the
surplus level in a manner that results in the surplus being within the
efficient surplus range.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The plan to reduce the surplus
must include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   proposals to benefit to
policyholders; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   proposals to improve the
overall health status of all New Jersey residents by: expanding access to
affordable, quality health care for underserved individuals; responding to
emerging health care issues in New Jersey; and promoting fundamental
improvements in the health status of all New Jersey residents, including but
not limited to substance use disorder treatment and prevention, behavioral
healthcare, maternal, child and chronic health services, cancer screening,
research and treatment, and improving veterans access to health care. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner is directed
to review the plan, make the plan available on the departments website, and
provide notice concerning a public comment period within 10 days of receipt of
the report.  The public is permitted an additional 20 day period to comment on
the proposal and, based upon the comments submitted from the public, and in
consultation with the Department of Health, the commissioner must make a
determination concerning the surplus.  The commissioner may:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   approve the surplus
level if it is justified consistent with the bills requirements;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   approve the health
service corporation plan to reduce the surplus to an efficient level; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   direct the health
service corporation to revise the plan to reduce the surplus to an efficient
level.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If, after 30 days from the
date of the end of the public comment period, the health service corporation
and the commissioner do not agree on a revised plan to reduce the surplus, the
commissioner is directed to order the health service corporation to deposit, no
later than 60 days after the date of the written notification, with the State, in
a newly created New Jersey Quality Health and Wellness Fund, the surplus
amount, or portion thereof, determined to be in excess of the efficient range.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes, in
the Department of Health, a nonlapsing, revolving fund, to be known as the New
Jersey Quality Health and Wellness Fund.  This fund shall consist of monies that
may be deposited by a health service corporation if it is directed to do so by
the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance after failing to otherwise agree on a
method of reducing the surplus deemed in excess of the efficient range.  The
monies collected in the fund shall be dedicated, and may be appropriated by the
Legislature after completion of the public process to be administered by the Commissioner
of Health concerning allocation of the funds in the New Jersey Quality Health
and Wellness Fund in a manner that benefits the public and is otherwise
consistent with this bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The public process to
determine the manner in which to allocate any funds in the New Jersey Quality
Health and Wellness Fund shall include testimony from members of the public
and health care experts determined by the commissioner to be necessary to
inform the process.  Testimony submitted shall be made available on the
departments website.  Once the public process is completed, the Commissioner
of Health shall make recommendations to the Legislature, based upon the
testimony submitted, concerning the manner in which to appropriate the funds.  The
Commissioner of Banking and Insurance shall suspend, and may revoke, the
certificate of authority of a health service corporation until the time that
the entire surplus amount, or portion thereof, determined to be in excess of
the efficient range is deposited in the fund.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also prohibits a
health service corporation with a previous-year surplus in the efficient range
from including a risk or contingency factor in its filed premium rates unless
and until the surplus level is at or below the lower bound of the surplus
range.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill also
supplements the Health Care Quality Act to require the Department of Banking
and Insurance to publish on its website the annual financial statement of each
carrier, as defined in that act, within 30 days of the receipt of that
statement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of the bill
that define the charitable mission of the health service corporation, require
the filing of the Form 990, and require DOBI to post the financial statement of
carriers, take effect immediately.  The remaining provisions of the bill<br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>concerning the revisions to a
health service corporations board of directors and the process of establishing
an efficient surplus, and reducing excess surplus, take effect on February 1,
2018.</p>
