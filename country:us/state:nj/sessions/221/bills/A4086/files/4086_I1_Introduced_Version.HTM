(cf: P.L.2010, c.44, s.6) 2.    (New section)  a.  As used in this section, converted development means a proposed age-restricted housing development located in the school district that will be marketed instead with no age restrictions pursuant to P.L.2009, c.82 (C.45:22A-46.3 et seq.). b.    Each school district in which a converted development is located shall receive converted development assistance aid.  Converted development assistance aid for a school district shall be calculated as follows: CDAA = (PENRBUD  ENRBASE) x COSTPP where PENRBUD is the school districts projected resident enrollment for the budget year; ENRBASE is the school districts actual resident enrollment in the last full school year prior to the occupancy of any dwelling unit in a converted development; and COSTPP is the lesser of the actual cost per pupil as determined under rules prescribed by the commissioner and approved by the State board, or the tuition rate adopted by the school districts board of education for the budget year. c.     In calculating converted development assistance aid pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the difference between PENRBUD and ENRBASE shall not exceed the actual number of students who reside in a converted development and are enrolled in a public school operated by the school district or a charter school, or placed by the school district in another public school or private school for students with disabilities. d.    A school district shall not be entitled to receive any additional State aid for a student who resides in a converted development, other than extraordinary special education costs aid awarded pursuant to subsection b. of section 13 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-55) and transportation aid awarded pursuant to section 15 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-57), for costs incurred that are greater than COSTPP. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall first be applicable to the first full school year beginning after the date of enactment. STATEMENT P.L.2009, c.82 (C.45:22A-46.3 et seq.) established a procedure by which an age-restricted housing development previously approved for construction by a municipal or regional planning board, zoning board of adjustment, or joint land use board may convert to a development that would be marketed with no age restrictions.  The law requires that the approving board approve an application for such a conversion if the developer satisfied certain requirements, and if the approving board determines that the conversion can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance. The conversion of an age-restricted development to a non-restricted development has the potential to increase the number of students enrolled in a districts public schools.  This bill provides converted development assistance aid to a school district in which such a conversion has occurred.  Specifically, the school district would receive an amount equal to the lesser of: 1) its actual cost per pupil, or 2) the per pupil tuition rate adopted by the school districts board of education for the school year, multiplied by the increase in its resident enrollment between the last school year prior to a dwelling unit within a converted development being occupied and the budget year.  However, the change in enrollment used to determine the aid may not exceed the total number of students who reside in a converted development.
