<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill expedites the process
for filling a vacancy from this State in the United States House of
Representatives under certain circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, and
pursuant to the United States Constitution and federal law, vacancies in the
United States House of Representatives are required to be filled by special election.
In contrast to the provisions for filling vacancies in the United States
Senate, where the Governor may make a temporary appointment to fill the vacancy
until it can be filled by election for the unexpired term, the United States
Constitution does not provide for the temporary appointment of a
Representative. The Governor has the responsibility to issue a writ of election
to fill the vacancy, while the Legislature may prescribe by law the elections
scheduling. Current law provides that it is the duty of the Governor to issue a
writ of election to fill such vacancy, unless the term of service for the vacant
office will expire within six months next after the happening of the vacancy.
Therefore, if the vacancy happens on or after July 3 of the second year of the
Representatives two-year term of office, then the vacancy is not required to
be filled.       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Current Law Circumstances and
Timeframes</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law specifies three
different vacancy scenarios under which the Governor is required or permitted
to designate the next general election day to fill the vacancy, permitted to
designate a special election day to fill the vacancy, and whether a primary
election or a special primary election is required to nominate the candidates
for election. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  <i>General Election With a
Primary Election</i>  if the vacancy happens <i>in any year</i>, not later
than the 70th day prior to the day for holding the next primary election for
the general election, the Governor is required to issue a writ of election to
fill the vacancy designating the next general election day as the day on which
the election will be held to fill such vacancy, with the nomination of
candidates made in the same manner as the nomination of other candidates at said
primary election. This scenario would typically cover vacancies occurring in
January, February, and most of March of either year of the Representatives
two-year term of office, with the primary election occurring in June and the
general election occurring in November.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  <i>General Election
Without a Primary Election</i>  if the vacancy happens in any year later than
the 70th day prior to the day for holding the primary election for the general
election but before the 70th day preceding the day of the general election, <i>and
the unexpired term to be filled exceeds one year</i>, the Governor is permitted
to designate the next general election day as the day on which the election
will be held to fill such vacancy, and that no primary election will be held for
the nomination of candidates. Each political party selects its candidate to
fill such vacancy in the same manner as under current law for selecting candidates
to fill vacancies that arise among candidates that won the primary election and
were thereby nominated to appear on the general election ballot. This scenario
would typically cover vacancies occurring in the period from the last days of
March through the last days of August, but only in the first year of the
Representatives two-year term of office, with the general election occurring
in November.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  <i>Special Election With a
Special Primary Election</i>  the Governor is permitted in the writ of
election to designate a special day for the election to fill the vacancy,
specifying the day on which a special primary election must be held, which must
be not less than 70 days nor more than 76 days following the issuance of the
writ, and specifying the day on which the special election must be held, which
must be not less than 64 days nor more than 70 days following the day of the
special primary election. Under this scenario, the special election to fill the
vacancy could occur approximately 134 to 143 days after the issuance of the
writ of election. Current law does not specify a timeframe for the Governor to
issue the writ of election. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Expedited Timeframes Under the
Bill</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill expedites the process
for filling a vacancy from this State in the United States House of
Representatives under certain circumstances. Specifically, the bill establishes
a timeframe of within 10 days of the occurrence of the vacancy for the Governor
to issue a writ of election. The bill also requires a special election to be
held to fill the vacancy when such vacancy occurs in any year earlier than in
the month of July. A special election would also be required to be held under
the bill when such vacancy occurs after the 70th day preceding the day of the
general election and the unexpired term to be filled exceeds one year. Finally,
the bill eliminates the requirement to hold a primary election or a special
primary election in all House of Representatives vacancy scenarios. Each
political party would select its candidate to fill such vacancy in the same
manner as under current law for selecting candidates to fill vacancies that
arise among candidates that won the primary election and were thereby nominated
to appear on the general election ballot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies three different
vacancy scenarios under which the Governor would be required to issue a writ to
fill the vacancy at either the general election or at a special election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  <i>General Election</i> 
if the vacancy happens <i>in any year</i> <i>not earlier than July 1 but on or
before the 70th day preceding the day of the general election</i>, the
Governor, in issuing a writ of election to fill the vacancy, would be required
to designate the next general election day as the day to fill the vacancy and
that no primary election will be held for the nomination of candidates. This
scenario would typically cover vacancies occurring in the month of July through
the end of August in any year of a Representatives two-year term of office,
with the general election occurring in November.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  <i>Special Election</i> <i>in</i>
<i>Any Year</i>  if the vacancy happens <i>in any year earlier than July 1</i>,
the Governor, in issuing a writ of election to fill such vacancy, would be
required to designate in said writ a special election day as the day to fill
the vacancy and that no primary election will be held for the nomination of
candidates. The day designated for the special election would be not less than
70 days nor more than 80 days following the issuance of the writ of election.
This scenario would cover vacancies occurring in the months of January through
June in any year of a Representatives two-year term of office, with the
special election occurring at least 70 days but not more than 90 days after the
occurrence of the vacancy, when accounting for the within 10 days timeframe established
under the bill for the Governor to issue the writ of election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  <i>Special Election in
First Year</i>  if the vacancy happens <i>after the 70th day preceding the day
of the general election and the unexpired term to be filled exceeds one year</i>,
the Governor, in issuing a writ of election to fill such vacancy, would be
required to designate in said writ a special election day as the day to fill
the vacancy and that no primary election will be held for the nomination of
candidates. The day designated for the special election would be not less than
70 days nor more than 80 days following the issuance of the writ of election.
This scenario would typically cover vacancies occurring from the end of August
through the month of December in the first year of a Representatives two-year
term of office, with the special election occurring at least 70 days but not
more than 90 days after the occurrence of the vacancy, when accounting for the
within 10 days timeframe established under the bill for the Governor to issue
the writ of election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The minimum 70-day timeframe
before an election is derived from the amount of time needed for election
officials and candidates to meet the various deadlines, such as ballot printing
and mailing, established for conducting an election in this State in compliance
with State and federal law requirements.</p>
