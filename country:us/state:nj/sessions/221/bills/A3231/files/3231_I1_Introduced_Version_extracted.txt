The chairman shall serve for a term of one year and may be reelected. f.     The chairman shall appoint three voting members actively engaged in farming and one alternate member actively engaged in farming to serve with the representatives of the general public for the purpose of mediating disputes pursuant to the provisions of section 19 of [this act] P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-26) . g.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections a. and b. of this section, any public body established by the governing body of any county prior to May 3, 1982 which was established to carry out functions substantially similar to the functions of boards pursuant to this act and which proposes to apply for grants pursuant hereto may carry out the functions authorized herein, provided that within five years following the effective date of this act those boards established prior to May 3, 1982 shall reorganize so that the board reflects no more than a simple majority of members actively engaged in farming or equal representation of the general public and those actively engaged in farming. (cf: P.L.1993, c.19, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill amends the Agriculture Retention and Development Act by creating alternate members on County Agriculture Development Boards (CADB) who are able to vote in the absence or disqualification of a voting member. This bill would require each CADB to have two alternate members, one of whom represents the general public and one of whom is actively engaged in farming.  These alternate members would each serve for a term of four years and may vote in place of an appointed voting member of their respective appointment background, should a voting member be absent or disqualified.  The alternate voting member may participate in discussions of the proceedings when not voting. The alternate member with a farming background would be appointed in the same manner as the four members actively engaged in farming, and the alternate member representing the general public would be appointed in the same manner as the three members representing the general public.
