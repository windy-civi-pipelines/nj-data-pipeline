<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require
schools and child care centers to test their drinking water for lead at least
every two years, and to take certain actions if they find a lead concentration
greater than five parts per billion is found.  The bill would also require
schools and child care centers to install filters that are certified to reduce
lead levels at each drinking water fountain or faucet that is regularly used
for drinking water or food preparation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
require the governing authority of a school and the owner or operator of a
child care center to test each drinking water outlet at their facilities in
accordance with a lead sampling plan.  The bill would establish certain minimum
requirements for the lead sampling plan, as enumerated in subsection b. of
sections 2 and subsection b. of section 6 of the bill, including the
requirement that samples be taken after the water supplying the outlet has sat
undisturbed in the pipes for between eight hours and 48 hours.  The bill would
also establish certain requirements on how the analysis of the water samples is
performed, as enumerated in subsection c. of sections 2 and subsection c. of
section 6 of the bill, including that the analysis be conducted by a laboratory
certified by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to analyze for
lead in drinking water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 96 hours after a school
or child care center receives the results of a lead test, it would be required
to make the test results public.  In addition, if any results exceed a lead
concentration of 5 parts per billion, the school or child care center would be
required to provide a written notification to the parents, the staff, and the
Department of Education (in the case of a school) or the Department of Children
and Families (in the case of a child care center).  The bill would require the
notification to include information regarding the health effects of lead and a
description of the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) measures taken by the
school or child care center to immediately end use of each drinking water
outlet where lead concentration exceeds five parts per billion;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) any additional remedial
actions taken or planned by the school or child care center; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) the measures taken to
ensure that alternate drinking water has been made available to all students,
children, and staff members at the school or child care center.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also require a
school or child care center to install and maintain point-of-use water filters,
which are certified by an accredited third-party certification body to meet National
Sanitation Foundation-American National Standards Institute standards 42 and
53, at any drinking fountain or faucet in the facility that is regularly used
by students, children, or teachers for drinking water or food preparation.  The
bill would also require a school or child care center to install, or cause to
be installed, replacement cartridges for the filters at the frequency
recommended by the manufacturer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current regulations adopted by
the State Board of Education, specifically N.J.A.C.6A:26-12.4, require schools
to conduct lead water testing in a nearly identical way to the provisions in
this bill.  However, this bill would require the testing to occur every two years,
rather than every three years, as under current regulations.  The bill would
also require schools to take action if a lead concentration of five parts per
billion is found.  Current regulations use the federal action level for lead,
which is 0.015 milligrams per liter (approximately equal to 15 parts per
billion).  The bill would also extend the modified testing requirements for
schools to child care centers as well, which are currently covered under
substantively different regulations, adopted by the Department of Children and
Families, at N.J.A.C.3A:52-5.3. </p>
