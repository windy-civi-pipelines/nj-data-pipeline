Murphy issued Executive Order No. 309 to establish the Task Force on Public School Staff Shortages in New Jersey to develop recommendations to address teacher and education support professional shortages in school districts across New Jersey. In February 2023, the 25-member task force issued 31 initial recommendations with a goal of addressing Statewide educator staffing shortages in the public schools of the State. The task force recommendations focused on both short-term and long-term solutions to increase recruitment to the educator workforce, identify best practices to increase the educator pipeline, and ensure the retention of school staff members. d.  To address the retention of existing school employees, including teachers, the task force recommended that administrative burdens, and other tasks that pull teachers from classroom instruction, be reassessed and reduced, if appropriate, including the reassessment of student growth objectives within the educator evaluation process established by the TEACHNJ Act and regulations issued by the Department of Education. e.  In response to the ongoing and widespread staffing challenges facing New Jersey schools, and considering the recommendations of the task force report, it is fitting and proper to examine revisions to the TEACHNJ Act. 2. (New section)  a.  There is established the New Jersey Educator Evaluation Review Task Force for the purpose of examining the educator evaluation process, gathering data, evaluating the data, and making recommendations concerning the annual evaluation process for teachers, principals, assistant principals, and vice principals established pursuant to the TEACHNJ Act, P.L.2012, c.26 (C.18A:6-117 et al.). b.
