<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Access to capital is
vitally important for the health, security, and well-being of all individuals
and businesses in our State.  They are the economic drivers that help New
Jerseys commerce run smoothly.  The lack of accessible capital, as currently
experienced due to the economic downturn, is exacerbating the economic
hardships being faced by working families and businesses;</p>

the State is able to direct economic development policy initiatives in a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The mission of the
State Bank of New Jersey shall be to promote small businesses, fair educational

development, commerce, and industry in New Jersey.  In this role, the bank
shall act as a funding resource in partnership with other financial
institutions, economic development groups, and guaranty agencies;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Accuracy of financial
reporting and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations shall be an
integral part of the State Bank of New Jerseys overall risk management
strategy; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     It is the intent of the
Legislature that State funds and funds of State institutions may<b> </b>be
deposited at the State Bank of New Jersey and guaranteed by the State. Other deposits
may be accepted from any public source.  The State Bank of New Jersey shall be
operated to benefit the citizens of New Jersey.  </p>
