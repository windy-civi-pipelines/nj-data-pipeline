(2)   Upon receipt of a complaint about a transportation service, the designated evaluator shall verify the facts of the complaint and catalogue the complaint in a monthly report, as provided by paragraph (3) of this subsection. (3)   On a monthly basis, the designated evaluator shall submit a report to the commissioner, to the Director of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, and to the Medicaid transportation broker, indicating:  (a) the total number of Medicaid beneficiaries who received transportation services during the month under the brokerage program, and the total number of Medicaid beneficiaries who received transportation services during the month from each individual transportation provider within the brokers network; (b) the total number of complaints that were filed during the month, and the number and percentage of those complaints that dealt with the broker, and with each individual provider in the brokers network; (c) the percentage of transportation recipients who filed a complaint during the month; and (d) the nature of the complaints that were filed.  The report submitted to the commissioner shall additionally provide a recommendation as to the amount of monthly liquidated damages, if any, that should be imposed on the broker by the department, pursuant to section 8 of this act, in response to the complaints. c.  (1)  The designated evaluator, on at least an annual basis, shall review the records maintained by the broker pursuant to subsection c. of section 6 of this act, and the transportation service logs and other records maintained by each individual provider pursuant to section 5 of this act, in order to ensure that the broker and the providers in its network are complying with applicable vehicle, staffing, and performance standards.  The designated evaluator shall also perform random and follow-up reviews, as deemed to be necessary. (2)  In conducting a performance review under this subsection, the designated evaluator shall determine whether: (a)  the vehicles used to transport Medicaid beneficiaries are fully compliant with all statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements; (b)  transport personnel are properly licensed and qualified to provide non-emergency medical transportation services; (c)  prior authorization is being obtained and medical necessity is being documented for beneficiaries who require the services of a mobility assistance vehicle; (d) individual providers consistently maintain all types of insurance required by law or regulation; (e)  beneficiaries using a transportation service actually receive a covered medical service on the date of transport; and (f)  the nature of transportation services provided to each beneficiary, including the date and time the beneficiary was picked-up and dropped-off for both the initial trip and the return trip, and the actual miles driven, are being accurately and consistently documented, as required by this act. (3)  Within 30 days after the completion of a performance review pursuant to this subsection, the designated evaluator shall prepare and submit to the commissioner, and to the Director of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, a report that identifies the evaluators findings with regard to the matters described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The report shall additionally provide a recommendation as to the amount of monthly liquidated damages, if any, that should be imposed on the broker by the department, pursuant to section 8 of this act, in response to any identified performance failures. d.    The department shall post, on its Internet website, the findings that are set forth in each annual report submitted pursuant to subsection c. of this section. 8.  a.  Monthly capitation fees that are paid by the department to the non-emergency medical transportation broker for each Medicaid beneficiary shall be offset by any liquidated damages that may be assessed by the department against the broker for failing to comply with, or failing to ensure that the individual providers in its network comply with, applicable vehicle, staffing, or performance standards. b.    The amount of liquidated damages imposed under this section shall be:  (1) based on the reports that are filed by the departments designated evaluator under subsections b. and c. of section 7 of this act; (2) consistent with the provisions of the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage contract, and the recommendations that are made by the departments designated evaluator under subsection c. of section 7 of this act; and (3) sufficient to deter future non-compliance.  Whenever the brokerage contract is being considered for renewal, the department shall review the contracts liquidated damage provisions, and revise the contract appropriately, in order to ensure that the maximum liquidated damage amounts specified therein are sufficient to deter future non-compliance. c.     Liquidated damages shall be imposed, on a monthly basis, as provided in this section, until the broker or individual providers, as the case may be, are deemed to be in compliance with applicable vehicle, staffing, and performance standards.  The amount of liquidated damages imposed by the department shall be increased, on a monthly basis, until full compliance is achieved, at which time liquidated damages may be reduced or eliminated, as deemed by the department to be appropriate. 9.  a.  The department shall: (1) implement policies and procedures, and review and appropriately revise the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage contract, as may be necessary to ensure that the reimbursement and capitation fees paid thereby under the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program are not paid in excess; and (2)  develop a system enabling the department to contract with another non-emergency medical transportation broker as may be necessary to ensure that the need for transportation services are met in a proper and timely manner, and that requested transportation services are provided to every person seeking such services pursuant to the provisions of this act. b.    The department shall develop a system that enables the department to:  (1) periodically review the monthly capitation fees that have been paid to the broker under the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage contract; (2) identify when capitation payments have been duplicated or made in excess; and (3) take action to fully recover such excess or duplicate payments.  The periodic review of monthly capitation payments, and the recovery of excess or duplicative payments, under the system established pursuant to this section, shall occur not less than once per year. c.     (1) In the case of adult medical day service centers, mileage reimbursement payments made by the department under the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program shall be based on the actual number of miles driven by the driver. (2)   A driver who provides simultaneous transportation services to more than one Medicaid beneficiary on any initial trip or return trip shall not receive mileage reimbursement in the same way as would be true if the driver had provided separate trips for each passenger.  Instead, the mileage reimbursement provided to a driver who is engaged in the provision of multi-passenger transportation services shall be based on the number of miles actually driven for the one passenger in the multi-passenger load who was transported over the farthest distance.  The contract executed between the department and the non-emergency medical transportation broker shall specify that a lower rate of mileage reimbursement will be authorized for multi-passenger loads, as provided in this paragraph. (3)   The department shall not authorize a mileage reimbursement payment, under this section, unless the Medicaid beneficiary being transported actually received a covered medical service on the date of transport.  The department shall institute procedures and protocols as necessary to verify that a covered medical service was actually received by the beneficiary, for the purposes of authorizing mileage reimbursements under this subsection. d.    A health care facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.) shall not be held liable or subject to an administrative penalty if a Medicaid beneficiary, for whom the health care facility scheduled a covered medical service transport pursuant to the transportation brokerage contract, does not receive the covered medical service. 10.  a.  The department shall annually submit to the Governor, and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1) to the Legislature, a report on the Medicaid transportation brokerage program.  The information that is contained in an annual report filed pursuant to this section shall be based on the departments review of the reports that were filed by its designated evaluator during the reporting period, pursuant to section 7 of this act. b.    The report filed pursuant to this section shall:  (1) describe the transportation services that have been provided under the Medicaid transportation brokerage program during the reporting period; (2) describe and categorize the nature of complaints that were filed during the reporting period; (3) include a performance evaluation of the broker and individual providers in the brokers network; (4) incorporate statistical data on the brokerage program, as provided by subsection c. of this section; (5) identify the actions that were undertaken during the reporting period by the broker, or by individual providers in the brokers network, in order to correct previously identified problems or otherwise improve service provision and fiscal responsibility under the brokerage program; (6) identify the actions that were undertaken by the department during the reporting period, including the imposition of liquidated damages pursuant to section 8 of this act, or the ordering of corrective action, which were designed to address identified problems and ensure future compliance with vehicle, staffing, and performance standards; and (7) provide recommendations for executive or legislative actions that can be undertaken to improve the brokerage program or ensure its proper and fiscally responsible implementation. c.     The statistical data that is included in an annual report shall identify, at a minimum:  (1) the percentage of providers whose staff members have not fully complied with applicable training standards;  (2) the percentage of providers whose vehicles are not fully compliant with applicable vehicle standards; (3) the percentage of transportation services that were not provided within the 15-minute timeframe required by subsection a. of section 3 of this act; (4) the number of complaints that were filed during the reporting period; and (5) the percentage of total transportation recipients during the period who filed a complaint. d.    The report filed pursuant to this section shall be posted on the departments Internet website concurrently with its submission to the Governor and the Legislature. 11.  Sections 1 through 7, and sections 9 and 10, of this act shall take effect immediately.  Section 8 of this act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment, except that the Commissioner of Human Services may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of that section. STATEMENT This bill establishes vehicle, staffing, and performance standards in association with the States non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program. Under the States non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program, the Department of Human Services (DHS) contracts with a non-emergency medical transportation broker to manage the provision of non-emergency medical transport to Medicaid beneficiaries in the State.  The transportation broker is responsible for:  developing and maintaining a non-emergency medical transport provider network for use by Medicaid program beneficiaries; verifying beneficiary eligibility for non-emergency medical transport; determining and authorizing the appropriate mode of transport for each beneficiary on the basis of medical necessity; and dispatching an appropriate provider vehicle to transport the beneficiary. Recent reports issued by the Office of Inspector General and the Office of the State Auditor have indicated that there are significant performance deficiencies in the provision of non-emergency transport under the brokerage program.  This bill is designed to address the issues raised in those reports. Specifically, the bill clarifies the requirements that are to be applicable to the DHS, the non-emergency medical transportation broker, and the individual providers within the brokers network, under the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program; and further establishes a procedure for the performance review of the broker and its authorized providers and the review of complaints that are submitted about the brokerage program. The bill clarifies that adult medical day care service centers, the non-emergency medical transportation broker is obligated to:  1) require a person requesting transportation services to certify that the transportation services are necessary for the person to receive a covered medical service under Medicaid; and 2) require a person requesting transport through the use of a mobility assistance vehicle (MAV) to submit a medical necessity form justifying the use of the MAV. Individual providers of transportation services under the brokerage program would be required to comply with the vehicle, staffing, and service delivery requirements specified therein. The DHS is required to designate an employee to engage in the ongoing monitoring and oversight of the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program. In conducting a performance review, the departments designated evaluator is to be required to determine whether:  1) vehicles used to transport Medicaid beneficiaries are fully compliant with all statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements; 2) transport personnel are properly licensed and qualified to provide non-emergency medical transportation services; 3) prior authorization is being obtained, and medical necessity is being documented, for beneficiaries who require MAV service; 4) individual providers consistently maintain requisite insurance policies; 5) transportation recipients actually receive a covered medical service on the date of transport; and 6) the transportation services provided to each beneficiary are adequately documented, as required by the bill.

(3)   On a monthly basis, the designated evaluator shall submit a report to the commissioner, to the Director of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, and to the Medicaid transportation broker, indicating:  (a) the total number of Medicaid beneficiaries who received transportation services during the month under the brokerage program, and the total number of Medicaid beneficiaries who received transportation services during the month from each individual transportation provider within the brokers network; (b) the total number of complaints that were filed during the month, and the number and percentage of those complaints that dealt with the broker, and with each individual provider in the brokers network; (c) the percentage of transportation recipients who filed a complaint during the month; and (d) the nature of the complaints that were filed.  The report submitted to the commissioner shall additionally provide a recommendation as to the amount of monthly liquidated damages, if any, that should be imposed on the broker by the department, pursuant to section 8 of this act, in response to the complaints. c.  (1)  The designated evaluator, on at least an annual basis, shall review the records maintained by the broker pursuant to subsection c. of section 6 of this act, and the transportation service logs and other records maintained by each individual provider pursuant to section 5 of this act, in order to ensure that the broker and the providers in its network are complying with applicable vehicle, staffing, and performance standards.  The designated evaluator shall also perform random and follow-up reviews, as deemed to be necessary. (2)  In conducting a performance review under this subsection, the designated evaluator shall determine whether: (a)  the vehicles used to transport Medicaid beneficiaries are fully compliant with all statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements; (b)  transport personnel are properly licensed and qualified to provide non-emergency medical transportation services; (c)  prior authorization is being obtained and medical necessity is being documented for beneficiaries who require the services of a mobility assistance vehicle; (d) individual providers consistently maintain all types of insurance required by law or regulation; (e)  beneficiaries using a transportation service actually receive a covered medical service on the date of transport; and (f)  the nature of transportation services provided to each beneficiary, including the date and time the beneficiary was picked-up and dropped-off for both the initial trip and the return trip, and the actual miles driven, are being accurately and consistently documented, as required by this act. (3)  Within 30 days after the completion of a performance review pursuant to this subsection, the designated evaluator shall prepare and submit to the commissioner, and to the Director of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, a report that identifies the evaluators findings with regard to the matters described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The report shall additionally provide a recommendation as to the amount of monthly liquidated damages, if any, that should be imposed on the broker by the department, pursuant to section 8 of this act, in response to any identified performance failures. d.    The department shall post, on its Internet website, the findings that are set forth in each annual report submitted pursuant to subsection c. of this section. 8.  a.  Monthly capitation fees that are paid by the department to the non-emergency medical transportation broker for each Medicaid beneficiary shall be offset by any liquidated damages that may be assessed by the department against the broker for failing to comply with, or failing to ensure that the individual providers in its network comply with, applicable vehicle, staffing, or performance standards. b.    The amount of liquidated damages imposed under this section shall be:  (1) based on the reports that are filed by the departments designated evaluator under subsections b. and c. of section 7 of this act; (2) consistent with the provisions of the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage contract, and the recommendations that are made by the departments designated evaluator under subsection c. of section 7 of this act; and (3) sufficient to deter future non-compliance.  Whenever the brokerage contract is being considered for renewal, the department shall review the contracts liquidated damage provisions, and revise the contract appropriately, in order to ensure that the maximum liquidated damage amounts specified therein are sufficient to deter future non-compliance. c.     Liquidated damages shall be imposed, on a monthly basis, as provided in this section, until the broker or individual providers, as the case may be, are deemed to be in compliance with applicable vehicle, staffing, and performance standards.  The amount of liquidated damages imposed by the department shall be increased, on a monthly basis, until full compliance is achieved, at which time liquidated damages may be reduced or eliminated, as deemed by the department to be appropriate. 9.  a.  The department shall: (1) implement policies and procedures, and review and appropriately revise the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage contract, as may be necessary to ensure that the reimbursement and capitation fees paid thereby under the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program are not paid in excess; and (2)  develop a system enabling the department to contract with another non-emergency medical transportation broker as may be necessary to ensure that the need for transportation services are met in a proper and timely manner, and that requested transportation services are provided to every person seeking such services pursuant to the provisions of this act. b.    The department shall develop a system that enables the department to:  (1) periodically review the monthly capitation fees that have been paid to the broker under the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage contract; (2) identify when capitation payments have been duplicated or made in excess; and (3) take action to fully recover such excess or duplicate payments.  The periodic review of monthly capitation payments, and the recovery of excess or duplicative payments, under the system established pursuant to this section, shall occur not less than once per year. c.     (1) In the case of adult medical day service centers, mileage reimbursement payments made by the department under the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program shall be based on the actual number of miles driven by the driver. (2)   A driver who provides simultaneous transportation services to more than one Medicaid beneficiary on any initial trip or return trip shall not receive mileage reimbursement in the same way as would be true if the driver had provided separate trips for each passenger.  Instead, the mileage reimbursement provided to a driver who is engaged in the provision of multi-passenger transportation services shall be based on the number of miles actually driven for the one passenger in the multi-passenger load who was transported over the farthest distance.  The contract executed between the department and the non-emergency medical transportation broker shall specify that a lower rate of mileage reimbursement will be authorized for multi-passenger loads, as provided in this paragraph. (3)   The department shall not authorize a mileage reimbursement payment, under this section, unless the Medicaid beneficiary being transported actually received a covered medical service on the date of transport.  The department shall institute procedures and protocols as necessary to verify that a covered medical service was actually received by the beneficiary, for the purposes of authorizing mileage reimbursements under this subsection. d.    A health care facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.) shall not be held liable or subject to an administrative penalty if a Medicaid beneficiary, for whom the health care facility scheduled a covered medical service transport pursuant to the transportation brokerage contract, does not receive the covered medical service. 10.  a.  The department shall annually submit to the Governor, and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1) to the Legislature, a report on the Medicaid transportation brokerage program.  The information that is contained in an annual report filed pursuant to this section shall be based on the departments review of the reports that were filed by its designated evaluator during the reporting period, pursuant to section 7 of this act. b.    The report filed pursuant to this section shall:  (1) describe the transportation services that have been provided under the Medicaid transportation brokerage program during the reporting period; (2) describe and categorize the nature of complaints that were filed during the reporting period; (3) include a performance evaluation of the broker and individual providers in the brokers network; (4) incorporate statistical data on the brokerage program, as provided by subsection c. of this section; (5) identify the actions that were undertaken during the reporting period by the broker, or by individual providers in the brokers network, in order to correct previously identified problems or otherwise improve service provision and fiscal responsibility under the brokerage program; (6) identify the actions that were undertaken by the department during the reporting period, including the imposition of liquidated damages pursuant to section 8 of this act, or the ordering of corrective action, which were designed to address identified problems and ensure future compliance with vehicle, staffing, and performance standards; and (7) provide recommendations for executive or legislative actions that can be undertaken to improve the brokerage program or ensure its proper and fiscally responsible implementation. c.     The statistical data that is included in an annual report shall identify, at a minimum:  (1) the percentage of providers whose staff members have not fully complied with applicable training standards;  (2) the percentage of providers whose vehicles are not fully compliant with applicable vehicle standards; (3) the percentage of transportation services that were not provided within the 15-minute timeframe required by subsection a. of section 3 of this act; (4) the number of complaints that were filed during the reporting period; and (5) the percentage of total transportation recipients during the period who filed a complaint. d.    The report filed pursuant to this section shall be posted on the departments Internet website concurrently with its submission to the Governor and the Legislature. 11.  Sections 1 through 7, and sections 9 and 10, of this act shall take effect immediately.  Section 8 of this act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment, except that the Commissioner of Human Services may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of that section. STATEMENT This bill establishes vehicle, staffing, and performance standards in association with the States non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program. Under the States non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program, the Department of Human Services (DHS) contracts with a non-emergency medical transportation broker to manage the provision of non-emergency medical transport to Medicaid beneficiaries in the State.  The transportation broker is responsible for:  developing and maintaining a non-emergency medical transport provider network for use by Medicaid program beneficiaries; verifying beneficiary eligibility for non-emergency medical transport; determining and authorizing the appropriate mode of transport for each beneficiary on the basis of medical necessity; and dispatching an appropriate provider vehicle to transport the beneficiary. Recent reports issued by the Office of Inspector General and the Office of the State Auditor have indicated that there are significant performance deficiencies in the provision of non-emergency transport under the brokerage program.  This bill is designed to address the issues raised in those reports. Specifically, the bill clarifies the requirements that are to be applicable to the DHS, the non-emergency medical transportation broker, and the individual providers within the brokers network, under the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program; and further establishes a procedure for the performance review of the broker and its authorized providers and the review of complaints that are submitted about the brokerage program. The bill clarifies that adult medical day care service centers, the non-emergency medical transportation broker is obligated to:  1) require a person requesting transportation services to certify that the transportation services are necessary for the person to receive a covered medical service under Medicaid; and 2) require a person requesting transport through the use of a mobility assistance vehicle (MAV) to submit a medical necessity form justifying the use of the MAV. Individual providers of transportation services under the brokerage program would be required to comply with the vehicle, staffing, and service delivery requirements specified therein. The DHS is required to designate an employee to engage in the ongoing monitoring and oversight of the non-emergency medical transportation brokerage program. In conducting a performance review, the departments designated evaluator is to be required to determine whether:  1) vehicles used to transport Medicaid beneficiaries are fully compliant with all statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements; 2) transport personnel are properly licensed and qualified to provide non-emergency medical transportation services; 3) prior authorization is being obtained, and medical necessity is being documented, for beneficiaries who require MAV service; 4) individual providers consistently maintain requisite insurance policies; 5) transportation recipients actually receive a covered medical service on the date of transport; and 6) the transportation services provided to each beneficiary are adequately documented, as required by the bill.
