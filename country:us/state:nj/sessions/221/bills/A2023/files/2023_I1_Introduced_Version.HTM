<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a. It is in the vital interest
of the general public that public works throughout the State of New Jersey be
administered efficiently and at a reasonable and equitable cost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. The unforeseen emergency of
unanticipated increases in construction material costs has imposed substantial
inequity upon government contractors awarded contracts after public bidding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c. Such inequity has
threatened the ability of contractors to fulfill the contracts awarded to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d. It is imperative that the
benefits derived by the general public from the existing system of public
bidding and the orderly performance of contracts awarded as a result of such
public bidding continue in an efficient manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e. It is therefore in the best
interest of the State to provide equitable relief to those government
contractors who have sustained damages from the unforeseen increases in
construction material costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  (1)  Notwithstanding
the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, whenever the
terms and conditions of a construction contract awarded by a contracting agency
of the State require a contractor to furnish materials in that contract
pertaining to such construction, the terms and conditions of the contract may
be adjusted upon a determination by the director of the appropriate division in
the Department of the Treasury that there has been an increase in the cost of
acquisition of those materials by the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier of
the materials in excess of five percent, determined as of the time of the award
of the contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The determination by the
director shall be based upon the available evidence, including, but not limited
to, an appropriate nationally recognized economic index published by the United
States Department of Labor or another appropriate organization.  Any such
increase shall be subject to the approval of the State Treasurer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any contractor, subcontractor,
or supplier of such materials who receives an increase in the cost of
construction materials shall also be subject to a downward adjustment in
construction material costs for subsequent decreases that may result in a cost
being lower than the original bid.  Any subsequent decrease shall be upon a
determination by the director.  The determination shall be based upon the
available evidence, including, but not limited to, an appropriate nationally
recognized economic index published by the United States Department of Labor or
another appropriate organization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any State contractor
requesting an adjustment shall submit an application in writing by submitting
documentary evidence to the State Contract Manager for such contract
establishing the increase in accordance with the requirements of the director. 
The evidence shall be subject to public inspection during regular business
hours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon the agreement of the
parties, the terms and conditions of the contract may be amended in writing to
reflect the increased or decreased cost of acquisition of construction
materials to the extent as the costs exceed five percent thereof and the
contract amendment shall state the amount of adjustment and basis therefor, but
in no event shall direct labor costs, additional profit, or overhead be part of
such adjustment.  No adjustment shall be granted in an amount which, together
with any other sum obligated under the contract, shall exceed the money
appropriated or otherwise lawfully available for the project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The provisions of this
subsection shall apply only to contracts awarded by a contracting agency that
are valued at $25 million or less and are based upon bids submitted prior to
December 1, 2021, but only for which materials shall have been purchased or
invoiced after March 1, 2020.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  The director is
authorized, with the approval of the State Treasurer, to terminate or suspend
for a part of its term any State contract award for the purchase of commodities
upon written application to the State Contract Manager for such termination or
suspension by the contractor, when extraordinary and unforeseen general market
conditions have caused increases in the contractors costs for construction
materials or other physical elements consisting of construction materials to be
sold under the contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A contractor shall submit, in
writing, evidence as required and deemed to be sufficient by the director, that
as the direct and sole result of those increases during the term of the
contract, that exceed five percent of the contractors aggregate acquisition
costs determined as of the time of the award, the contractor has incurred or
will incur an actual net loss on such contract from the estimated sales made
under the contract and the contractor would continue to incur those net losses
unless the contract is suspended or terminated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Such determination for a
termination or suspension under this subsection shall be made by the director. The
determination by the director shall be based upon the available evidence,
including, but not limited to, an appropriate nationally recognized economic
index published by the United States Department of Labor or another appropriate
organization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The director is
authorized, following the determination made pursuant to the provisions of
paragraph (1) of this subsection, that the contractor has incurred or will
incur an actual net loss on such contract from the sales made under the
contract, to grant an increase for the costs of the commodities specified by
the contract, in amounts necessary to prevent further net losses to the contractor
on such contract from deliveries to be made thereafter under the contract, as
compensation for and not exceeding increases of the contractors acquisition
costs during the contract term.  Any increase in contract costs shall be
subject to the approval of the State Treasurer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any contractor who receives an
increase for the cost of the commodities shall also be subject to a downward
adjustment in the cost of the commodities for subsequent decreases that may
result in a cost being lower than the original bid.  Any subsequent decrease
shall be upon a determination by the director that there has been a subsequent
decrease in the cost of acquisition of such construction materials by the
contractor, subcontractor, or supplier of materials.  A determination shall be
based upon the available evidence, including, but not limited to, an
appropriate nationally recognized economic index published by the United States
Department of Labor or another appropriate organization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The provisions of this
