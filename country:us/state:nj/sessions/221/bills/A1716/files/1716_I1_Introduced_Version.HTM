STATEMENT This bill increases the public bidding threshold for contracts through which workers employed in the performance of the contract are not subject to the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act to $100,000 for Rowan University, Montclair State University, Kean University, and the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). This bill reflects the changes made to the State College Contracts Law by P.L.2021, c.417 and makes the same changes for the public research universities in the State. Under current law, the public bidding threshold is $17,700 for NJIT, $30,700 for Rowan University, and $33,000 for Montclair State University and Kean University. Public research universities are prohibited from entering into contracts that exceed the threshold unless the university publicly advertises for bids and awards the contract to the entity whose bid would be most advantageous for the university. This bill increases the public bidding thresholds for all four public research universities for any contract through which workers employed in the performance of the contract are not subject to the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act to $100,000. The bidding threshold for contracts through which workers employed in the performance of the contract are subject to the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act are unaffected by this bill for Rowan University, Montclair State University and Kean University, and is amended to $29,100 for NJIT to reflect the most recent threshold determined by the Governor in July 2021. Under the bill, the thresholds will continue to be adjusted by the Governor every two years, in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.

STATEMENT This bill increases the public bidding threshold for contracts through which workers employed in the performance of the contract are not subject to the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act to $100,000 for Rowan University, Montclair State University, Kean University, and the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). This bill reflects the changes made to the State College Contracts Law by P.L.2021, c.417 and makes the same changes for the public research universities in the State. Under current law, the public bidding threshold is $17,700 for NJIT, $30,700 for Rowan University, and $33,000 for Montclair State University and Kean University. Public research universities are prohibited from entering into contracts that exceed the threshold unless the university publicly advertises for bids and awards the contract to the entity whose bid would be most advantageous for the university. This bill increases the public bidding thresholds for all four public research universities for any contract through which workers employed in the performance of the contract are not subject to the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act to $100,000. The bidding threshold for contracts through which workers employed in the performance of the contract are subject to the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act are unaffected by this bill for Rowan University, Montclair State University and Kean University, and is amended to $29,100 for NJIT to reflect the most recent threshold determined by the Governor in July 2021. Under the bill, the thresholds will continue to be adjusted by the Governor every two years, in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.
