five-year achievement review set forth in subparagraph (b) of paragraph (3) of
this subsection, the person includes a demonstration that confirms no net
emissions increases have occurred at the facility over the previous five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)  The department shall
involve in the development of the rules and regulations for the 15-year plan
program adopted pursuant to this paragraph representatives of the affected
industry, environmental, and public interest groups as well as impacted
governmental entities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  Consistent with the
provisions of P.L.1991, c.422 (C.13:1D-111 et seq.), the department shall
periodically publish, with an opportunity provided for public comment,
technology, methods, and performance levels with respect to air pollution
control for use by applicants for demonstrating advances in the art of air
pollution control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The department shall,
within 18 months after the effective date of P.L.1995, c.188 (C.26:2C-9.5 et
al.), publish the first technical manual containing technology, methods, and
performance levels that can be used by applicants for demonstrating advances in
the art of air pollution control.  Public notice of the availability of each
draft technical manual shall be published in the New Jersey Register, and each
final technical manual shall consider any public comments thereon that are
received by the department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Once the department has
published a technical manual for advances in the art of air pollution pursuant
to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (4) of this subsection, any application
submitted that demonstrates compliance with that technical manual shall be
considered to incorporate advances in the art of air pollution control for the
source operations covered by the technical manual.  The department shall
periodically review and update each technical manual as necessary, after
providing public notice and opportunity for public comment.  If the department
amends a technical manual, the new standard shall apply only to applications
submitted after the final publication of the amended technical manual.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Instead of relying on a
technical manual for advances in the art of air pollution control, an applicant
may propose &quot;case-by-case&quot; advances in the art of air pollution
control applicable to a specific source operation.  If the department
determines that the proposal is consistent with the provisions of this
subsection, the proposal shall be deemed to constitute advances in the art of
air pollution control for that specific source operation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Advances in the art of
air pollution control shall include new source performance standards adopted by
the EPA on or after the effective date of P.L.1995, c.188 (C.26:2C-9.5 et al.)
and those new source performance standards published as advances in the art of
air pollution control pursuant to P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Before an operating
permit, operating permit revision or operating certificate or any renewal
thereof is issued, or as a condition of issuance, the department may require
the applicant to conduct such tests as are necessary to determine the kind or
amount of the air contaminant emitted from the equipment or whether the
equipment or fuel or the operation of the equipment is in violation of any of the
provisions of P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.) or of any codes, rules, or
regulations adopted pursuant thereto.  The tests shall be made at the expense
of the applicant and shall be conducted in a manner approved by the department,
and the test results shall be reviewed and professionally certified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Grandfathered equipment
or control apparatus shall not be subject to a demonstration of advances in the
art of air pollution control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)  An operating permit and
operating certificate or any renewal thereof shall be valid for a period of
five years from the date of issuance, unless sooner revoked for cause by order
of the department, and may be renewed upon application to the department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   Upon receipt of an
application for the issuance of an operating certificate or any renewal
thereof, the department, in its discretion, may issue a temporary operating
certificate valid for 90 days or until a five-year operating certificate has
been issued or denied.</p>

requirement that would not be federally enforceable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Notwithstanding the
provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, the
department may issue a general permit in lieu of any permit issued pursuant to
this section.  Prior to issuing a general permit, the department shall provide
public notice and opportunity for public comment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The department may
require the reporting and evaluation of emissions information for any air
contaminant.  However, prior to requiring that such information be included on
a permit or regulating any air contaminant not regulated by the EPA pursuant to
the federal Clean Air Act, the department shall first make a determination and
advise the public of its conclusion that regulating that air contaminant is in
the best interest of human health, welfare and the environment, and publish
that determination and justification in accordance with the provisions of the
&quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     Except as otherwise
prohibited by federal law, any person who has submitted to the department an

the footings or foundation where it is intended to be used during the pendency
of the permit application review process.  A person intending to take action
authorized pursuant to this subsection shall notify the department, via
certified mail, of the intent to undertake the action at least seven days prior
to the commencement of the action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person who constructs
equipment or control apparatus in accordance with this subsection that the
department determines is not consistent with applicable State laws, codes,
rules, or regulations shall not be subject to civil or criminal penalties for
that inconsistent action provided that the person's actions do not result in
the emission of any air contaminants.  Any costs incurred by the applicant in connection
with such construction may not be used by the applicant as grounds for an
appeal of the department's decision on the permit application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    For the purposes of
P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.), the use of VOCs not otherwise listed by
the EPA as hazardous air pollutants, or specified by the department pursuant to
subsection i. of this section, shall be considered as a single pollutant. 
These VOCs may be used interchangeably and such use shall not be considered new
installation or modification of equipment or control apparatus.</p>

(C.26:2C-37 et al.), to authorize the Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP) to adopt rules and regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
expand the authority given to the DEP to regulate air pollution in the State to
also include &quot;excess greenhouse gas emissions,&quot; which is defined by
the bill to mean &quot;Statewide greenhouse gas emissions which exceed those of
the limits established in section 4 of P.L.2007, c.112 (26:2C-40) or the
interim benchmarks adopted pursuant to section 5 of P.L.2007, c.112

carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons,
sulfur hexafluoride, and any other gas or substance determined by the DEP to be
a significant contributor to the problem of global warming.  The bill would
also direct the DEP to adopt rules and regulations, no later than 24 months
after the bill's enactment, which incorporate greenhouse gas emissions limits
into the DEP's operating permit requirements adopted pursuant to &quot;Air
Pollution Control Act (1954),&quot; and include any other restrictions on
greenhouse gas emissions deemed by the DEP to be necessary for the State to
