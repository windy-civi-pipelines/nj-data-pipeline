<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under New Jersey law, when a
law enforcement entity hires a recently trained officer from another law
enforcement entity, it is required to compensate the officers former employer
for the costs associated with that officers hiring and training.  The law sets
forth two levels of liability.  In those cases where the officer has held a
permanent appointment for 30 days or less, the new employer is required to
reimburse the officers former employer for all the costs associated with the
officers hiring and training.  In those cases where the officer has held a
permanent appointment for more than 30 days, but less than two years, the new
employer is required to reimburse the officers former employer for one-half of
the costs associated with the officers hiring and training.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     While there is no debate over
what constitutes the cost of hiring and training a law enforcement officer,
there are, however, conflicting interpretations concerning the time frames,
particularly the treatment of an officers provisional period of appointment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, the starting
point for the time frames is the date the officer completed his or her required
police training.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It also shortens the period
for which a new employer is liable for reimbursement payments.  In those cases
where the officer has been employed for 120 days or less from the date of
completing the required police training course, the new employer is required to
reimburse the officers former employer for all the costs associated with the
officers hiring and training.  In those cases where the officer has been
employed for more than 120 days, but less than two years from the date of
completing the police training course, the new employer is required to
reimburse the officers former employer for one-half of the costs associated
with the officers hiring and training.</p>
