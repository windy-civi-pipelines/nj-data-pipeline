STATEMENT This bill would provide a refundable gross income tax credit to resident taxpayers for a portion of homeowners association assessments that are paid by taxpayers for primary residences within any common interest community, and which are used by the homeowners association to support infrastructure improvements within the community.  A taxpayer would be eligible for the credit regardless of whether the primary residence is subject to property taxes or an agreement for payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT payments). Specifically, the homeowners association infrastructure improvement tax credit would equal the amount of homeowners association assessments constituting infrastructure improvements paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year.  The bill defines homeowners association assessments constituting infrastructure improvements to include 18 percent of the total homeowners association assessments paid by a taxpayer during a taxable year. When filing a tax return that includes a claim for the credit, a taxpayer would be required to submit a copy of a certification, issued upon application by the taxpayer to their homeowners association, that calculates the amount of the homeowners association assessments constituting infrastructure improvements paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year for which the credit is claimed.
