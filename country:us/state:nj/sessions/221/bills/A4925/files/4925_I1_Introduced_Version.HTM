otherwise allowed under this section that cannot be applied for the privilege
period due to the limitations of this subsection, or under other provisions of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.), may be carried forward, if necessary, to
the three privilege periods following the privilege period for which the tax

receiving the initial certification, concerning the issuance of a final
certification of tax credits to the taxpayer.</p>
