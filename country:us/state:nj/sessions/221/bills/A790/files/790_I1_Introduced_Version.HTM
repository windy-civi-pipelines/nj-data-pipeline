c.49 (C.46:15-5) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   &quot;Deed&quot; means a
written instrument entitled to be recorded in the office of a county recording
officer which purports to convey or transfer title to a freehold interest in
any lands, tenements or other realty in this State by way of grant or bargain
and sale thereof from the named grantor to the named grantee.  A leasehold
interest for 99 years or more or a proprietary lease of a cooperative unit and
any assignment of a proprietary lease of a cooperative unit, shall be treated
as a &quot;freehold&quot; for the purpose of this act.  Instruments providing
for common driveways, for exchanges of easements or rights-of-way, for
revocable licenses to use, to adjust or to clear defects of or clouds on title,
to provide for utility service lines such as drainage, sewerage, water,
electric, telephone or other such service lines, or to quitclaim possible
outstanding interests, shall not be &quot;deeds&quot; for the purposes of this
act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  The terms &quot;county
recording officer&quot; and &quot;office of the county recording officer&quot;
mean the register of deeds and mortgages in counties having such an officer and
office, and the county clerk and his office in the other counties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   &quot;Consideration&quot;
means in the case of any deed, the actual amount of money and the monetary
value of any other thing of value constituting the entire compensation paid or
to be paid for the transfer of title to the lands, tenements or other realty,
including the remaining amount of any prior mortgage to which the transfer is
subject or which is to be assumed and agreed to be paid by the grantee and any
other lien or encumbrance thereon not paid, satisfied or removed in connection
with the transfer of title.  The amount of liens for real property taxes, water
or sewerage charges for the current or any subsequent year, or by way of added
assessment or other adjustment, as well as of other like liens or encumbrances
of a current and continuing nature ordinarily adjusted between the parties according
to the period of ownership shall be </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>excluded as an element in
determining the consideration, notwithstanding that such amount is to be paid
by the grantee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of a leasehold
interest for 99 years or more as defined in subsection (a) of this section, the
consideration shall be in the amount of the assessed value of the property at
the date of the transaction for the purpose of levying local real property
taxes adjusted to reflect the true value in accordance with the county
percentage level established for the current year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of a proprietary
lease of a cooperative unit or assignment thereof as defined in subsection (a)
of this section, the consideration is the total price paid for the ownership
interest held in conjunction with a cooperative unit, including the pro rata
amount of any underlying mortgage or other obligation of the cooperative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)  &quot;Blind person&quot;
means a person whose vision in his better eye with proper correction does not
exceed 20/200 as measured by the Snellen chart or a person who has a field
defect in his better eye with proper correction in which the peripheral field
has contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of visual field
subtends an angular distance no greater than 20ø.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   &quot;Disabled
person&quot; means any resident of this State who is permanently and totally
disabled, unable to engage in gainful employment, and receiving disability
benefits or any other compensation under any federal or State law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   &quot;Senior
citizen&quot; means any resident of this State of the age of 62 years or over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill eliminates  a) the
general purpose fee, one of the four realty transfer fees; and  b) the one-percent
assessment on the selling price of residential property transacted for more
than $1 million. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     P.L.2004, c.66 imposed the
general purpose fee on the seller of non-exempt real property whose selling
price equals or exceeds $350,000.  It applies to the full amount of the
property sale and has the following schedule:  $0.90 on each $500 of
consideration on the first $550,000 of the value recited in the deed of transfer;
$1.40 on each $500 of consideration between $550,000 and $850,000; $1.90 on
each $500 of consideration between $850,000 and $1,000,000; and $2.15 on each
$500 of consideration over $1,000,000.  As a consequence of this bill, property
sellers will pay a diminished amount in realty transfer fees.  For example, the
legislation lowers the fee liability by $900, or roughly 22 percent, for real
property selling at $500,000.  For a property selling at $1.2 million, in turn,
the liability decreases by $3,260, or about 27 percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     P.L.2004, c.66 also levied a
one-percent assessment on the transaction of residential property selling for
more than $1 million that the propertys buyer has to pay.  The assessments
repeal, which also covers farmland if it includes a residential structure, will
save a purchaser of a $1.5 million residential property $15,000, for example. </p>
