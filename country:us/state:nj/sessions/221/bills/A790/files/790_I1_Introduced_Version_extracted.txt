(2)  The fee imposed by subsection a. of this section shall not apply to a deed if the transfer of real property is incidental to a corporate merger or acquisition and the equalized assessed value of the real property transferred is less than 20% of the total value of all assets exchanged in the merger or acquisition.  A grantee shall claim this exemption from imposition of the fee at the time the deed is offered for recording by filing with the county recording officer such information, in addition to the affidavit of consideration filed by one or more of the grantee parties named in the deed or by the grantee's legal representative pursuant to subsection d. of this section, as the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury may prescribe as to constitute a filing of a protest of the assessment of the fee and by paying any other recording fees not exempted pursuant to this paragraph.  This additional information shall be forwarded by the county recording officer to the director along with the grantee's affidavit of consideration, and shall be deemed to be and have the effect of a protest of a finding by the director of a deficiency of payment of the fee filed on the date on which the deed is recorded. (3)  The fee imposed by subsection a. of this section shall not apply to a deed if the transfer of real property is entered into on or after January 1, 2021 and is an intercompany transfer between combined group members as part of the unitary business, as those terms are used in section 4 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-4). c.   The fee imposed by subsection a. of this section shall be subject to the provisions of the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et seq.; provided however, that notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of R.S.54:49-14, a taxpayer may file a claim under oath for refund at any time within 90 days after the payment of any original fee and that subsection b. of R.S.54:49-14 shall not apply to any additional fee assessed. d.   (1) If a transfer includes property classified pursuant to the requirements of N.J.A.C.18:12-2.2 as Class 4 property of any type, an affidavit of consideration shall be filed by one or more of the grantor parties named in the deed or by the grantor's legal representative declaring the consideration and shall be annexed to and recorded with the deed as a prerequisite for the recording of the deed. The filing of an affidavit of consideration pursuant to this paragraph shall be in addition to the filing, if any, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)  Whether or not the transfer is exempt, pursuant to subsection b. of this section or any other provision of law, from payment of the fee pursuant to subsection a. of this section, if a transfer includes property otherwise subject to subsection a. of this section, then an affidavit of consideration shall be filed by one or more of the grantee parties named in the deed or by the grantee's legal representative declaring the consideration and shall be annexed to and recorded with the deed as a prerequisite for the recording of the deed.  The filing of an affidavit of consideration pursuant to this paragraph shall be in addition to the filing, if any, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. (3)  An affidavit of consideration filed pursuant to paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this subsection shall clearly and entirely state the consideration, the county and municipality in which the property is situate, and the block and lot description of the real property conveyed. (4)  One copy of each affidavit of consideration filed and recorded with deeds pursuant to this subsection shall be forwarded by the county recording officer to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury on the tenth day of the month following the month of the filing of the deed. (cf: P.L.2020, c.118, s.2) 6.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to transfers of real property occurring on or after the first day of the second calendar month following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill eliminates  a) the general purpose fee, one of the four realty transfer fees; and  b) the one-percent assessment on the selling price of residential property transacted for more than $1 million. P.L.2004, c.66 imposed the general purpose fee on the seller of non-exempt real property whose selling price equals or exceeds $350,000.  It applies to the full amount of the property sale and has the following schedule:  $0.90 on each $500 of consideration on the first $550,000 of the value recited in the deed of transfer; $1.40 on each $500 of consideration between $550,000 and $850,000; $1.90 on each $500 of consideration between $850,000 and $1,000,000; and $2.15 on each $500 of consideration over $1,000,000.  As a consequence of this bill, property sellers will pay a diminished amount in realty transfer fees.  For example, the legislation lowers the fee liability by $900, or roughly 22 percent, for real property selling at $500,000.  For a property selling at $1.2 million, in turn, the liability decreases by $3,260, or about 27 percent. P.L.2004, c.66 also levied a one-percent assessment on the transaction of residential property selling for more than $1 million that the propertys buyer has to pay.  The assessments repeal, which also covers farmland if it includes a residential structure, will save a purchaser of a $1.5 million residential property $15,000, for example.

(3) In addition to the amounts credited pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, commencing with the first State fiscal year next following the enactment of P.L.2021, c.126, an amount equal to $20,000,000 shall annually be credited to the Special Needs Housing Trust Fund, created pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.163 (C.34:1B-21.25a), in the manner established under that section. d.    All amounts paid to the State Treasurer from the payment of the additional fee  shall be credited to the [Neighborhood Preservation Nonlapsing Revolving] New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund established pursuant to P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), in the manner established under section 20 thereof (C.52:27D-320). (cf:  P.L.2021, c.126, s.1) 5.    Section 8 of P.L.2004, c.66 (C.46:15-7.2) is amended to read as follows: 8.    a.  In addition to all other fees imposed under P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-5 et seq.), there is imposed a fee upon the grantee of a deed for the transfer of real property: (1)  [that is classified pursuant to the requirements of N.J.A.C.18:12-2.2 as Class 2 "residential";] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (2)  [(a)     that includes property classified pursuant to the requirements of N.J.A.C.18:12-2.2 as Class 3A: "farm property (regular)" but only if the property includes a building or structure intended or suited for residential use, and (b)  any other real property, regardless of class, that is effectively transferred to the same grantee in conjunction with the property described in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph;] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (3)  [that is a cooperative unit as defined in section 3 of P.L.1987, c.381 (C.46:8D-3); or] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (4)  that is classified pursuant to the requirements of N.J.A.C.18:12-2.2 as Class 4A "commercial properties" that is transferred for consideration in excess of $1,000,000 recited in the deed, which fee shall be an amount equal to 1 percent of the entire amount of such consideration, which fee shall be collected by the county recording officer at the time the deed is offered for recording and remitted to the State Treasurer not later than the 10th day of the month following the month of collection for deposit into the General Fund. b.    (1) The fee imposed by subsection a. of this section shall not apply to a deed if the grantee of the deed for the transfer of real property is an organization determined by the federal Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of section 501 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.501. (2)  The fee imposed by subsection a. of this section shall not apply to a deed if the transfer of real property is incidental to a corporate merger or acquisition and the equalized assessed value of the real property transferred is less than 20% of the total value of all assets exchanged in the merger or acquisition.  A grantee shall claim this exemption from imposition of the fee at the time the deed is offered for recording by filing with the county recording officer such information, in addition to the affidavit of consideration filed by one or more of the grantee parties named in the deed or by the grantee's legal representative pursuant to subsection d. of this section, as the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury may prescribe as to constitute a filing of a protest of the assessment of the fee and by paying any other recording fees not exempted pursuant to this paragraph.  This additional information shall be forwarded by the county recording officer to the director along with the grantee's affidavit of consideration, and shall be deemed to be and have the effect of a protest of a finding by the director of a deficiency of payment of the fee filed on the date on which the deed is recorded. (3)  The fee imposed by subsection a. of this section shall not apply to a deed if the transfer of real property is entered into on or after January 1, 2021 and is an intercompany transfer between combined group members as part of the unitary business, as those terms are used in section 4 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-4). c.   The fee imposed by subsection a. of this section shall be subject to the provisions of the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et seq.; provided however, that notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of R.S.54:49-14, a taxpayer may file a claim under oath for refund at any time within 90 days after the payment of any original fee and that subsection b. of R.S.54:49-14 shall not apply to any additional fee assessed. d.   (1) If a transfer includes property classified pursuant to the requirements of N.J.A.C.18:12-2.2 as Class 4 property of any type, an affidavit of consideration shall be filed by one or more of the grantor parties named in the deed or by the grantor's legal representative declaring the consideration and shall be annexed to and recorded with the deed as a prerequisite for the recording of the deed. The filing of an affidavit of consideration pursuant to this paragraph shall be in addition to the filing, if any, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)  Whether or not the transfer is exempt, pursuant to subsection b. of this section or any other provision of law, from payment of the fee pursuant to subsection a. of this section, if a transfer includes property otherwise subject to subsection a. of this section, then an affidavit of consideration shall be filed by one or more of the grantee parties named in the deed or by the grantee's legal representative declaring the consideration and shall be annexed to and recorded with the deed as a prerequisite for the recording of the deed.  The filing of an affidavit of consideration pursuant to this paragraph shall be in addition to the filing, if any, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. (3)  An affidavit of consideration filed pursuant to paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this subsection shall clearly and entirely state the consideration, the county and municipality in which the property is situate, and the block and lot description of the real property conveyed. (4)  One copy of each affidavit of consideration filed and recorded with deeds pursuant to this subsection shall be forwarded by the county recording officer to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury on the tenth day of the month following the month of the filing of the deed. (cf: P.L.2020, c.118, s.2) 6.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to transfers of real property occurring on or after the first day of the second calendar month following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill eliminates  a) the general purpose fee, one of the four realty transfer fees; and  b) the one-percent assessment on the selling price of residential property transacted for more than $1 million. P.L.2004, c.66 imposed the general purpose fee on the seller of non-exempt real property whose selling price equals or exceeds $350,000.  It applies to the full amount of the property sale and has the following schedule:  $0.90 on each $500 of consideration on the first $550,000 of the value recited in the deed of transfer; $1.40 on each $500 of consideration between $550,000 and $850,000; $1.90 on each $500 of consideration between $850,000 and $1,000,000; and $2.15 on each $500 of consideration over $1,000,000.  As a consequence of this bill, property sellers will pay a diminished amount in realty transfer fees.  For example, the legislation lowers the fee liability by $900, or roughly 22 percent, for real property selling at $500,000.  For a property selling at $1.2 million, in turn, the liability decreases by $3,260, or about 27 percent. P.L.2004, c.66 also levied a one-percent assessment on the transaction of residential property selling for more than $1 million that the propertys buyer has to pay.  The assessments repeal, which also covers farmland if it includes a residential structure, will save a purchaser of a $1.5 million residential property $15,000, for example.
