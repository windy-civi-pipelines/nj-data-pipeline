The bill requires the Department of Environmental Protection to establish a system to test for regulated PFAS and approve of laboratories to conduct the tests.  Results of any test conducted pursuant to the bill are required to be available to the Department of Health for inspection, either from the manufacturer or the laboratory. A violation of the bills provisions would be an unlawful practice under the Consumer Fraud Act, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), and would be punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense.  Additionally, a violation of the Consumer Fraud Act can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured. The bill would be effective 18 months after enactment, but permits the commissioners of DEP and DOH to take anticipatory administrative action.
