STATEMENT This bill requires the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission to provide both vehicle and licensing services at each commission agency location and to allow these services to be completed in-person at each agency.  The bill also requires that, at each commission agency location, the commission provide service to walk-in customers seeking vehicle and licensing services. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the commission designated each commission agency location as either a licensing center or vehicle center, required appointments for certain services, and required certain services to be completed online.  The commission continues to operate in this manner, which in certain circumstances, requires customers to travel a great distance or make multiple appointments to obtain service.  This bill requires the commission to operate as it did prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and to offer both vehicle and licensing services at each agency location, allow walk-in customers to obtain service, and allow customers to obtain service at each agency rather than requiring certain services to be completed online.
