"Criminal record" means information about an individual collected by criminal justice agencies consisting of identifiable descriptions and notations of arrests, detentions, indictments, criminal complaints, or other formal criminal charges, and any disposition arising therefrom, including acquittal, sentencing, correctional supervision, release or conviction, including, but not limited to, any sentence arising from a verdict or plea of guilty or nolo contendere, including a sentence of incarceration, a suspended sentence, a sentence of probation, or a sentence of conditional discharge. "Director" means the Director of the Division on Civil Rights. "Division" means the Division on Civil Rights in the Department of Law and Public Safety. "Housing provider" means a landlord, an owner, lessor, sublessor, assignee, or their agent, or any other person receiving or entitled to receive rents or benefits for the use or occupancy of any rental dwelling unit, except that this term shall not include a county or municipality that directly rents one or more residential units to a tenant or tenants.

STATEMENT This bill would amend the "Fair Chance in Housing Act," P.L.2021, c.110 (C.46:8-52 et seq.), to clarify that a county or municipality that directly rents one or more residential units to one or more tenants is not a housing provider, as defined in that act. During 2021, the Legislature enacted the "Fair Chance in Housing Act" for the purpose of establishing certain housing rights for persons with criminal records.  That enactment was designed to expand opportunities for people with criminal records to find safe, affordable housing and reduce recidivism.  Since enactment of the "Fair Chance in Housing Act," it has been disputed whether the acts provisions apply to a county or municipal government that directly rent one or more residential units to one or more tenants.  This bill resolves those disputes by specifically providing that the "Fair Chance in Housing Act" does not apply to a county or municipal or county government that directly rents one or more residential units to one or more tenants.
