If the heir or legatee of the firearm does not qualify to possess or carry it, he may retain ownership of the firearm for the purpose of sale for a period not exceeding 180 days, or for a further limited period as may be approved by the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality in which the heir or legatee resides or the superintendent, provided that the firearm is in the custody of the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality or the superintendent during that period. k.    Sawed-off shotguns.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.327, s.6) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes that the background investigation of an applicant for a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun is to take precedence over the investigation of other applicants if a restraining order obtained by the applicant against a domestic violence offender pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991 is in effect. To implement this provision, the bill also requires the standard application form for an identification card or permit to set forth whether a restraining order obtained by the applicant against a domestic violence offender pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991 is in effect. The intent of the bill is to expedite the process of obtaining identification cards or permits for victims of domestic violence so they are better able to protect themselves from their attackers.

If the heir or legatee of the firearm does not qualify to possess or carry it, he may retain ownership of the firearm for the purpose of sale for a period not exceeding 180 days, or for a further limited period as may be approved by the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality in which the heir or legatee resides or the superintendent, provided that the firearm is in the custody of the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality or the superintendent during that period. k.    Sawed-off shotguns.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.327, s.6) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes that the background investigation of an applicant for a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun is to take precedence over the investigation of other applicants if a restraining order obtained by the applicant against a domestic violence offender pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991 is in effect. To implement this provision, the bill also requires the standard application form for an identification card or permit to set forth whether a restraining order obtained by the applicant against a domestic violence offender pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991 is in effect. The intent of the bill is to expedite the process of obtaining identification cards or permits for victims of domestic violence so they are better able to protect themselves from their attackers.
