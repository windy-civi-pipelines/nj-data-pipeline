MOEN, JR. District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) SYNOPSIS Requires rail passenger service to provide purchasers with proof of payment at time of purchase. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning rail passenger service proof of payment and amending P.L.1997, c.357. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.   Section 2 of P.L.1997, c.357 (C.27:25-5.7) is amended to read as follows: 2.   a. The use of a rail passenger service by a person shall constitute an agreement by the person to pay the prescribed fare for the service.  A person who has paid the prescribed fare for a rail passenger service and who has been issued proof of payment therefor shall retain that proof of payment while in a pre-paid fare area or on designated rail passenger facilities or vehicles. b.   The proof of payment issued pursuant to this section shall not require any additional validation in order to serve as valid proof of payment for the applicable fare.  The proof of payment shall clearly state the rail passenger service line or lines and the specific duration for which the proof of payment is valid.  An authorized employee or fare enforcement officer may require a customer to display the proof of payment, which shall be valid pursuant to the terms stated on the proof of payment, however, no additional actions by the purchaser shall be necessary in order for the purchaser to be in compliance with the provisions of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.357 (C.27:25-5.8). (cf: P.L.1997, c.357, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately, but shall remain inoperative for 90 days following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill prevents the New Jersey Transit Corporation (New Jersey Transit) from requiring any validation of proof of payment for rail passenger service.  The bill also requires the proof of payment provided for use of rail passenger service to include the lines of service and the duration for which the proof of payment is valid.  If a customer is in possession of an authentic proof of payment, that is valid pursuant to the terms on the proof of payment, and provides it to authorized employees or fare enforcement officers, then the customer is not to be considered in violation of fare policy for rail passenger service. Currently, New Jersey Transit light rail and Newark subway service utilize a payment system where passes purchased from vending machines are not valid for use until stamped at a validation machine located on each platform, which places a time stamp on the pass giving the customer a fixed time in which they can utilize the service after they validate the pass.  Many individuals are unaware of this policy, do not validate a pass that they purchase, and are subsequently fined as a result.  This bill will prevent the use of the validation machines.  Instead, a pass will have to identify the period of time in which it can be used at the time of purchase, and be clearly stated on the pass.
