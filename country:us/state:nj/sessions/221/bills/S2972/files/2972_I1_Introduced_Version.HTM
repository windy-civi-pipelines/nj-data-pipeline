<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 9 of P.L.2009,
c.79 (C.19:63-9) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.    a. Except as provided in
subsection d. of this section, starting on or before the 45th day before the
day an election is held, each county clerk shall forward mail-in ballots by
first-class postage or hand delivery to each mail-in voter whose request
therefor has been approved.  Mail-in ballots that have been approved before the
45th day before an election shall be forwarded or delivered at least 45 days
before the day of the election.  Hand delivery of a mail-in ballot shall be
made by the county clerk or the clerk's designee only to the voter, or the
voter's authorized messenger, who must appear in person.  No person shall serve
as an authorized messenger for more than three qualified voters in an election,
but a person may serve as such for up to five qualified voters in an election
if those voters are immediate family members residing in the same household as
the messenger.  Ballots that have not been hand delivered shall be addressed to
the voter at the forwarding address given in the application.  In the case of a
voter choosing to have their mail-in ballot sent to a secondary address, if the
ballot is returned or marked undeliverable for two consecutive general
elections, then future mail-in ballots shall be mailed to the voter's address
where they are registered to vote and the voter shall be notified in writing of
the change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1) Whenever the clerk
forwards a mail-in ballot by mail to a mail-in voter between the 45th day and
the 13th day before the day of an election, the ballot shall be transmitted
within three business days of the receipt of the application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Whenever the clerk
forwards a mail-in ballot by mail to a mail-in voter between the 12th day and
the seventh day before the day of an election, the ballot shall be transmitted
within two business days of the receipt of the application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of this
subsection shall not apply to: (a) annual school elections and special school
elections in those school districts holding such elections, pursuant to P.L.1995,
c.278 (C.19:60-1 et seq.); (b) any municipality in which elections are
conducted by mail, pursuant to P.L.2005, c.148 (C.19:62-1 et seq.); (c) annual
elections for members of the boards of fire district commissions, pursuant to
N.J.S.40A:14-72, when such elections are held at a time other than the time of
the general election; and (d) the vote on any public question submitted to the
voters of a local unit to increase the amount to be raised by taxation by more
than the allowable adjusted tax levy, pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2007, c.62
(C.40A:4-45.46)<u>, except that, in the case of a fire district, if the amount
of money proposed to be raised for the ensuing year would exceed the
permissible property tax levy increase, a public question shall be submitted to
the legal voters to increase the amount to be raised by taxation by more than
the allowable adjusted tax levy at the time of the general election pursuant to
subsection f. of N.J.S.40A:14-72</u>.</p>

overseas mail-in voter, as defined by the federal &quot;Uniformed and Overseas
Citizens Absentee Voting Act&quot; (52 U.S.C. s.20301 et seq.), or any general
election voter in this State whose request for a mail-in ballot has been
approved, shall be forwarded by the county clerk a mail-in ballot by
first-class postage or hand delivery no later than the 45th day before the day
of a federal election.  Whenever the county clerk forwards a mail-in ballot by
mail to a uniformed or overseas mail-in voter or a State general election voter
between the 45th day and the 13th day before the day of a federal election, the
ballot shall be transmitted within three business days of the receipt of the
application.  Nothing in this section, as amended by P.L.2022, c.70, shall be
construed to be inconsistent with the federal &quot;Uniformed and Overseas

circulating in the county wherein the municipality is located at least once and
not less than 10 days prior to the hearing.  After the hearing the governing
body shall determine the question of designation of a fire district.  If the
governing body decides that the designation of a fire district is appropriate,
it, by ordinance, shall designate a territorial location or locations for use
as a fire district or fire districts and, by resolution, provide for the
election of a board of fire commissioners for the district or each district, to
consist of five persons, residents therein, and specify the date, time and
