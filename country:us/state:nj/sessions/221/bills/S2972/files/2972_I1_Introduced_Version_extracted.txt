Any candidate may withdraw as a candidate by filing a notice in writing, signed by the candidate, of such withdrawal with the county clerk on or before the 70th day before the date of the November election, as applicable, and thereupon the name of that candidate shall be withdrawn by the county clerk and shall not be printed on the ballot. A vacancy created by any reason set forth in R.S.19:13-18, or in any other manner, shall be filled under the provisions of R.S.19:13-19.

An election shall be held annually either on the third Saturday in February or at the time of the general election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in each established fire district for the election of members of the board according to the expiration of terms.  The initial election for a newly created fire district may take place on another date as a governing body may specify under N.J.S.40A:14-70, but the annual election thereafter shall be held either on the third Saturday in February or at the time of the general election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. b.    For an election held at a time other than at the time of the general election, the place of the election shall be determined by the board and a notice thereof, and of the closing date for the filing with the clerk of the board of petitions of nomination for membership on the board, shall be published at least once in a newspaper circulating in the district, at least six weeks prior to the date fixed for the election. c.     For an election held at the time of the general election, the place of the election shall be determined pursuant to R.S.19:8-1 et seq. and notice thereof shall be published pursuant to R.S.19:12-7.  Notice of the closing date for the filing, with the county clerk, of nominations by petition for direct nomination for membership on the board shall be published by the board at least once in a newspaper circulating in the district, at least 21 days prior to the date by which such nominations are required to be filed with the county clerk. d.    Fire districts located in the same municipality may combine the publication of their notices of election.  For the purpose of this section, "notices of election" shall include the notices required to be published under section 6 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-6). e.     The legal voters at an annual election held on the third Saturday in February shall determine the amount of money to be raised for the ensuing year and determine such other matters as may be required[.

After moving the date of a fire district's annual election to the day of the general election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, the date of the annual fire election shall be held at that time and shall not be changed. b.    (1) An annual election shall not be moved to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, to be held simultaneously with the general election, pursuant to subsection a. of this section, unless the county board of elections has certified that the election may be conducted in accordance with the requirements of section 1 of P.L.1976, c.83 (C.19:4-10). (2)   The county board of elections for a county within which a fire district is located shall determine, within 30 days of the effective date of P.L.2017, c.206, whether an annual election may be so conducted. (a)   If the county board of elections determines that an annual election may be conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the board shall transmit a certification to the board of fire commissioners and the governing body of the municipality within which the district is located. (b)   If the county board of elections determines that an annual election may not be conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the board shall transmit a letter to the fire district so stating. In order to meet the requirement of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the board of election may revise or readjust the boundary lines of any election district and the board of fire commissioners, if authorized by an ordinance adopted by the governing body of the municipality, may revise or readjust the boundary lines of any fire district, including by means of consolidating or subdividing districts, as may be necessary, except as may be otherwise required by section 6 of P.L.1976, c.83 (C.19:4-15).  The Local Finance Board shall approve any proposed consolidation or subdivision of a fire district in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Local Authorities Fiscal Control Law, P.L.1983, c.313 (C.40A:5A-1 et seq.), or sections 2 and 3 of P.L.2015, c.279 (C.40A:14-90.1 et seq.), as applicable.  Any fire district whose boundaries have been adjusted shall notify the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs. Upon the completion of such revision or readjustment of the boundary lines of any election district by the board of elections, the board of election shall transmit a certification to the board of fire commissioners and the governing body of the municipality within which the district is located. Upon the completion of such revision or readjustment of the boundary lines of any fire district by the board of fire commissioners, the fire district shall transmit a letter so notifying the county board of elections. The board of elections shall, within 30 days thereafter, transmit either a certification to the board of fire commissioners and the governing body of the municipality within which the district is located, provided the board of election can then certify compliance with paragraph (1) of this subsection, or a letter to the board of fire commissioners stating that compliance with paragraph (1) of this subsection has not been met notwithstanding the revision or readjustment. c.     If the time of the annual election is moved to the time of the general election pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the term of a member of a board of fire commissioner elected at the time of a general election shall commence at 12 o'clock noon on the first Tuesday in December, and shall expire at 12 o'clock noon on the first Tuesday in December of the third year following the year in which such member was elected.  Any vacancy in the membership shall be filled by the remaining members until the next succeeding annual election held at the time of the general election, at which time a resident of the district shall be elected for the unexpired term. (cf: P.L.2017, c.206, s.22) 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires public questions allowing a fire district to exceed the permissible property tax levy increase to be submitted for voter approval at the general election.  Under current law, the legal voters at an annual fire district election held on the third Saturday in February are authorized to determine the amount of money to be raised for the ensuing year.  If the amount of money proposed to be raised for the ensuing year would exceed the permissible property tax levy increase, a public question is required to be submitted to the legal voters to increase the amount to be raised by taxation by more than the allowable adjusted tax levy. Voter turnout is often much lower during elections that take place at a time other than the time of the general election.  Therefore, this bill provides that only a fire district that holds its annual election at the time of the general election is authorized to ask the legal voters to determine whether to increase the amount to be raised by taxation by more than the allowable adjusted tax levy for the ensuing year through the submission of a public question. Under the bill, the board of fire commissioners of the fire district is required to notify the county or municipal clerk, as appropriate, of the need to conduct a referendum pursuant to this subsection at least 60 days before the date of the general election.

Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, the board of fire commissioners of a fire district may by resolution move the time of the annual election for the fire district to the time of the general election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.  If the time of the annual election for a fire district is moved to the time of the general election, the fire district election shall be held for the purposes of electing members of the board of fire commissioners and for voting on any appropriation or other matter according to the provisions of N.J.S.40A:14-70 et seq., including submitting a question to the legal voters to determine whether to increase the amount to be raised by taxation by more than the allowable adjusted tax levy for the ensuing year through the submission of a public question.  The procedures for holding a fire district election at the time of the general election shall be in accordance with the procedures provided for the general election under Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, except as otherwise provided pursuant to N.J.S.40A:14-70 et seq. After moving the date of a fire district's annual election to the day of the general election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, the date of the annual fire election shall be held at that time and shall not be changed. b.    (1) An annual election shall not be moved to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, to be held simultaneously with the general election, pursuant to subsection a. of this section, unless the county board of elections has certified that the election may be conducted in accordance with the requirements of section 1 of P.L.1976, c.83 (C.19:4-10). (2)   The county board of elections for a county within which a fire district is located shall determine, within 30 days of the effective date of P.L.2017, c.206, whether an annual election may be so conducted. (a)   If the county board of elections determines that an annual election may be conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the board shall transmit a certification to the board of fire commissioners and the governing body of the municipality within which the district is located. (b)   If the county board of elections determines that an annual election may not be conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the board shall transmit a letter to the fire district so stating.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.206, s.22) 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires public questions allowing a fire district to exceed the permissible property tax levy increase to be submitted for voter approval at the general election.  Under current law, the legal voters at an annual fire district election held on the third Saturday in February are authorized to determine the amount of money to be raised for the ensuing year.  If the amount of money proposed to be raised for the ensuing year would exceed the permissible property tax levy increase, a public question is required to be submitted to the legal voters to increase the amount to be raised by taxation by more than the allowable adjusted tax levy. Voter turnout is often much lower during elections that take place at a time other than the time of the general election.  Therefore, this bill provides that only a fire district that holds its annual election at the time of the general election is authorized to ask the legal voters to determine whether to increase the amount to be raised by taxation by more than the allowable adjusted tax levy for the ensuing year through the submission of a public question. Under the bill, the board of fire commissioners of the fire district is required to notify the county or municipal clerk, as appropriate, of the need to conduct a referendum pursuant to this subsection at least 60 days before the date of the general election.
