Following the review, the department will encourage and support providers in implementing the departments recommendations regarding the uses of technology via the distribution of available federal and State funds, the establishment of grant or low interest loan programs, the implementation of performance incentives, or the provision of other aid deemed appropriate and necessary by the Commissioner of Health. Second, the bill expands an existing law requiring long-term care facilities to implement an electronic medical records requirement, and that provides need-based grants via the DOH to implement this requirement, to also include home and community-based service providers.  The bill also requires the DOH to provide grants to long-term care providers to support the exchange of user-friendly clinical information via an electronic health record system with State hospitals. Third, commencing six months following the effective date of the bill, the DOH is to require each long-term care facility in the State, as a condition of licensure, to provide internet, television, and telephone services within each residential room.  To the extent possible, the long-term care facility will also provide residents with the necessary equipment to utilize these services.  The department will distribute federal and State funds to facilities in compliance with this provision, and to determine compliance with the provision during facility inspections.  In addition to any other applicable penalties provided by law, a long-term care facility that fails to comply with these provisions is liable to pay an administrative penalty and may be subject to adverse licensure action. Finally, this bill amends section 11 of P.L.2021, c.310 to clarify that the provisions of that law requiring a health benefits plan to provide coverage and payment parity for health care services delivered to a covered person from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 through telemedicine or telehealth at a provider reimbursement rate that equals the in-person provider reimbursement rate, includes those health care services provided in a long-term care setting.
