The bill would permit the NJIB to use any loan repayments received to date, and the amounts for interest accrued pursuant to a loan made to a project sponsor pursuant to the Community Hazard Assistance Mitigation Program, in order to fund the CHAMP program for FY 2026.  The bill would also authorize the NJIB to utilize certain funds generated by the operation of the bank, including, but not limited to, proceeds from the sale of bonds, the revenues derived from investments, and loan repayments, to defray the NJIBs FY 2026 operating expenses. Since its creation in 2023, the NJIB, in partnership with the State Office of Emergency Management in the Department of Law and Public Safety, applied for federal STORM Act funds and received approximately $7 million to finance the construction of hazard mitigation and resilience projects with the mission of reducing the cost of financing these projects for New Jersey counties and municipalities.
