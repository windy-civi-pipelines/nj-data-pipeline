(2)     The election shall be made in the manner as the director may by regulation prescribe. (3)     An election or specification with respect to a privilege period may be revoked by the taxpayer with respect to any property, and the revocation, once made, shall be irrevocable. c.     The director shall prescribe the rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including, among others, those for determining the adjusted basis of the emergency power supply system property for the purposes of the "Corporation Business Tax Act (1945)," P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.). d.    For the purposes of this section: Emergency power supply system means an emergency power supply system as defined in section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 4.    a.  Receipts from sales of property comprising an emergency power supply system required to be installed in a planned real estate development pursuant to P.L.    , c.

(2)   The election shall be made in the manner as the director may by regulation prescribe. (3)   An election or specification with respect to a privilege period may be revoked by the taxpayer with respect to any property, and the revocation, once made, shall be irrevocable. (4)   The election under this section shall be made by the business entity of a taxpayer, and shall apply to each owner of the business entity. c.     The director shall prescribe the rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including, among others, those for determining the adjusted basis of the acquired property for the purposes of the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. d.    For the purposes of this section: Emergency power supply system means emergency power supply system as defined in section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 6.    This act shall take effect the first day of the fourth month next following enactment and be applicable to applications for construction permits and applications for registration that are not complete on that date, however, the Commissioner of Community Affairs shall immediately take all actions necessary to ensure that this act takes effect on the effective date. STATEMENT This bill would require the installation of an emergency power supply system to supply standby power to each clubhouse or community room in a new common interest community.  Hurricane Sandy resulted in prolonged power outages throughout the State of New Jersey and surrounding areas.  While Hurricane Sandy is the most recent and prominent example of extended power outages caused by extraordinary weather conditions, it was not an isolated occurrence with regard to extended power outages. Many parts of New Jersey have been developed as common interest communities.  Although these planned communities may isolate residential dwellings from public and commercial buildings, these communities often contain clubhouses or other facilities that could be used as a shelter during times of emergency. By requiring new common interest communities to equip clubhouses and community rooms with an alternate source of electrical power, the bill will provide residents of these communities with a centrally-located, well-powered shelter to better wait-out future power outages.  While this bill would not require existing common interest communities to retrofit their clubhouses and community rooms with emergency power supply systems, the sponsors recommend and encourage these communities to do so. In recognition of the quasi-public purpose of this initiative, the bill provides a corporation business tax deduction and gross income tax deduction (not to exceed $10,000 in either case), and a sales tax exemption, for the purchase of equipment necessary for the installation of emergency power supply systems by developers of new common interest communities as required under the bill.
