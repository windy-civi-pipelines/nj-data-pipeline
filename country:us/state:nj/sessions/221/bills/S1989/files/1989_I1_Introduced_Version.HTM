(cf: P.L.2013, c.51, s.3) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The bill expands the reach of the statute by including those individuals who receive a financial benefit from participating in human trafficking without necessarily being an organizer, supervisor, financier or manager of the enterprise or scheme.
