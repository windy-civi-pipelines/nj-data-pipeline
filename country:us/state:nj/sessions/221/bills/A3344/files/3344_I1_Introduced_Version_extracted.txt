(cf: P.L.2005, c.41, s.3) 2.  Section 7 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-7) is amended to read as follows: 7. a.

The redevelopment plan shall include an outline for the planning, development, redevelopment, or rehabilitation of the project area sufficient to indicate: (1)   Its relationship to definite local objectives as to appropriate land uses, density of population, and improved traffic and public transportation, public utilities, recreational and community facilities and other public improvements. (2)   Proposed land uses and building requirements in the project area. (3)   Adequate provision for the temporary and permanent relocation, as necessary, of residents in the project area, including an estimate of the extent to which decent, safe and sanitary dwelling units affordable to displaced residents will be available to them in the existing local housing market. (4)   An identification of any property within the redevelopment area which is proposed to be acquired in accordance with the redevelopment plan. (5)   Any significant relationship of the redevelopment plan to (a) the master plans of contiguous municipalities, (b) the master plan of the county in which the municipality is located, and (c) the State Development and Redevelopment Plan adopted pursuant to the "State Planning Act," P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.). (6)   As of the date of the adoption of the resolution finding the area to be in need of redevelopment, an inventory of all housing units affordable to low and moderate income households, as defined pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304), that are to be removed as a result of implementation of the redevelopment plan, whether as a result of subsidies or market conditions, listed by affordability level, number of bedrooms, and tenure. (7)   A plan for the provision, through new construction or substantial rehabilitation of one comparable, affordable replacement housing unit for each affordable housing unit that has been occupied at any time within the last 18 months, that is subject to affordability controls and that is identified as to be removed as a result of implementation of the redevelopment plan.  Displaced residents of housing units provided under any State or federal housing subsidy program, or pursuant to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), provided they are deemed to be eligible, shall have first priority for those replacement units provided under the plan; provided that any such replacement unit shall not be credited against a prospective municipal obligation under the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), if the housing unit which is removed had previously been credited toward satisfying the municipal fair share obligation.  To the extent reasonably feasible, replacement housing shall be provided within or in close proximity to the redevelopment area.  A municipality shall report annually to the Department of Community Affairs on its progress in implementing the plan for provision of comparable, affordable replacement housing required pursuant to this section.

(2)  A municipality or designated redevelopment entity, which provides notice of the hearing on or adoption of a redevelopment plan, or subsequent amendments thereof, authorizing the development of a warehouse greater than 100,000 square feet or high-density development, may negotiate and collect revenue from a redeveloper to recover the costs of providing such notice. (3)  As used in this subsection, high-density development means development proposed at a greater concentration of density or intensity of land use than authorized within the area, section, or sections, under the current master plan and development regulations. d.    All provisions of the redevelopment plan shall be either substantially consistent with the municipal master plan or designed to effectuate the master plan; but the municipal governing body may adopt a redevelopment plan which is inconsistent with or not designed to effectuate the master plan by affirmative vote of a majority of its full authorized membership with the reasons for so acting set forth in the redevelopment plan. e.     Prior to the adoption of a redevelopment plan, or revision or amendment thereto, the planning board shall transmit to the governing body, within 45 days after referral, a report containing its recommendation concerning the redevelopment plan.  This report shall include an identification of any provisions in the proposed redevelopment plan which are inconsistent with the master plan and recommendations concerning these inconsistencies and any other matters as the board deems appropriate. The governing body, when considering the adoption of a redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof, shall review the report of the planning board and may approve or disapprove or change any recommendation by a vote of a majority of its full authorized membership and shall record in its minutes the reasons for not following the recommendations.  Failure of the planning board to transmit its report within the required 45 days shall relieve the governing body from the requirements of this subsection with regard to the pertinent proposed redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof.  Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the applicability of the provisions of subsection d. of this section with respect to any redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof. f.     The governing body of a municipality may direct the planning board to prepare a redevelopment plan or an amendment or revision to a redevelopment plan for a designated redevelopment area.  After completing the redevelopment plan, the planning board shall transmit the proposed plan to the governing body for its adoption.  The governing body, when considering the proposed plan, may amend or revise any portion of the proposed redevelopment plan by an affirmative vote of the majority of its full authorized membership and shall record in its minutes the reasons for each amendment or revision.  When a redevelopment plan or amendment to a redevelopment plan is referred to the governing body by the planning board under this subsection, the governing body shall be relieved of the referral requirements of subsection e. of this section. (cf: P.L.2021, c.168, s.2). 3. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill enhances certain notice requirements under the "Municipal Land Use Law," P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) and under the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.) in cases involving development proposals  for large warehouses and high-density developments.  Innovation within the warehousing sector has led to the development of much larger warehouses than the types of warehouses built back when many current master plans and zoning ordinances were adopted.  Because of their size and scope of operation, development of these new types of warehouses have resulted in the imposition of significant regional negative impacts throughout New Jersey.  The bill provisions would also become applicable to high-density development proposals. The bill defines the term high-density development to mean development proposed at a greater concentration of density or intensity of land use than authorized within the area, section, or sections, under the current master plan and development regulations. In order to enhance the dialogue among potential warehouse and high-density developers and existing community members, the bill will require developers to provide notice of a hearing on an application proposing the development of a warehouse greater than 100,000 square feet or a high-density development to be given at least 20 days prior to the hearing by the municipal clerk to: · the owners of real property located within the municipality which is the site of the proposed development; and · if the proposed development of a warehouse or high-density development is located within 300 feet of a municipal boundary, to the owners of all real property located within a municipality that is adjacent to the municipality that is the site of the proposed development, and · if the proposed development of a warehouse or high-density development is located within an area designated pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.) as Planning Area 4A (Rural Planning Area) and within and within 1,000 feet of the municipal boundary, to the owners of all real property located within a municipality that is adjacent to the municipality that is the site of the proposed development. Additionally, the bill provides that if a redevelopment plan or subsequent amendments thereof authorizes the development of a warehouse greater than 100,000 square feet or a high-density development, notice is to be given at least 20 days prior to the hearing by the municipal clerk to: the owners of all real property located within the municipality; and if the proposed development is located within 300 feet of a municipal boundary, to the owners of all real property located within a municipality that is adjacent to the municipality that is the site of the proposed development; and if the proposed development of a warehouse or high-density development is located within an area designated pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.) as Planning Area 4A (Rural Planning Area) and within 300 feet of the municipal boundary, to the owners of all real property located within 1,000 feet of the site of the proposed development Under the bill, a municipality or designated redevelopment entity, which provides notice to the owners of real property within the municipality of the hearing on or adoption of a redevelopment plan, or subsequent amendments thereof, authorizing the development of a warehouse greater than 100,000 square feet or a high-density development, may negotiate and collect revenue from a redeveloper to recover the costs of providing such notice.

(cf: P.L.2005, c.41, s.3) 2.  Section 7 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-7) is amended to read as follows: 7. a. No redevelopment project shall be undertaken or carried out except in accordance with a redevelopment plan adopted by ordinance of the municipal governing body, upon its finding that the specifically delineated project area is located in an area in need of redevelopment or in an area in need of rehabilitation, or in both, according to criteria set forth in section 5 or section 14 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-5 or 40A:12A-14), as appropriate. The redevelopment plan shall include an outline for the planning, development, redevelopment, or rehabilitation of the project area sufficient to indicate: (1)   Its relationship to definite local objectives as to appropriate land uses, density of population, and improved traffic and public transportation, public utilities, recreational and community facilities and other public improvements. (2)   Proposed land uses and building requirements in the project area. (3)   Adequate provision for the temporary and permanent relocation, as necessary, of residents in the project area, including an estimate of the extent to which decent, safe and sanitary dwelling units affordable to displaced residents will be available to them in the existing local housing market. (4)   An identification of any property within the redevelopment area which is proposed to be acquired in accordance with the redevelopment plan. (5)   Any significant relationship of the redevelopment plan to (a) the master plans of contiguous municipalities, (b) the master plan of the county in which the municipality is located, and (c) the State Development and Redevelopment Plan adopted pursuant to the "State Planning Act," P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.). (6)   As of the date of the adoption of the resolution finding the area to be in need of redevelopment, an inventory of all housing units affordable to low and moderate income households, as defined pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304), that are to be removed as a result of implementation of the redevelopment plan, whether as a result of subsidies or market conditions, listed by affordability level, number of bedrooms, and tenure. (7)   A plan for the provision, through new construction or substantial rehabilitation of one comparable, affordable replacement housing unit for each affordable housing unit that has been occupied at any time within the last 18 months, that is subject to affordability controls and that is identified as to be removed as a result of implementation of the redevelopment plan.  Displaced residents of housing units provided under any State or federal housing subsidy program, or pursuant to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), provided they are deemed to be eligible, shall have first priority for those replacement units provided under the plan; provided that any such replacement unit shall not be credited against a prospective municipal obligation under the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), if the housing unit which is removed had previously been credited toward satisfying the municipal fair share obligation.  To the extent reasonably feasible, replacement housing shall be provided within or in close proximity to the redevelopment area.  A municipality shall report annually to the Department of Community Affairs on its progress in implementing the plan for provision of comparable, affordable replacement housing required pursuant to this section. (8)   Proposed locations for zero-emission vehicle fueling and charging infrastructure within the project area in a manner that appropriately connects with an essential public charging network. b.    A redevelopment plan may include the provision of affordable housing in accordance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the housing element of the municipal master plan. c.     (1)  The redevelopment plan shall describe its relationship to pertinent municipal development regulations as defined in the "Municipal Land Use Law," P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.).  The redevelopment plan shall supersede applicable provisions of the development regulations of the municipality or constitute an overlay zoning district within the redevelopment area.  When the redevelopment plan supersedes any provision of the development regulations, the ordinance adopting the redevelopment plan shall contain an explicit amendment to the zoning district map included in the zoning ordinance.  The zoning district map as amended shall indicate the redevelopment area to which the redevelopment plan applies.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Municipal Land Use Law," P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) or of other law, no notice beyond that required for adoption of ordinances by the municipality shall be required for the hearing on or adoption of the redevelopment plan or subsequent amendments thereof, unless the redevelopment plan or subsequent amendments thereof authorizes the development of a warehouse greater than 100,000 square feet or high-density development.  If a redevelopment plan or subsequent amendments thereof authorizes the development of a warehouse greater than 100,000 square feet or high-density development, notice shall be given at least 20 days prior to the hearing by the municipal clerk to the owners of all real property, as shown on the current tax duplicates, located within the municipality; and, if the proposed development of a warehouse or high-density development is located within 300 feet of the municipal boundary, to the owners of all real property located within a municipality that is adjacent to the municipality that is the site of the proposed development, however  if the proposed development of a warehouse or high-density development is located within an area designated pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.) as Planning Area 4A (Rural Planning Area) and within 300 feet of the municipal boundary, to the owners of all real property located within 1,000 feet of the site of the proposed development. (2)  A municipality or designated redevelopment entity, which provides notice of the hearing on or adoption of a redevelopment plan, or subsequent amendments thereof, authorizing the development of a warehouse greater than 100,000 square feet or high-density development, may negotiate and collect revenue from a redeveloper to recover the costs of providing such notice. (3)  As used in this subsection, high-density development means development proposed at a greater concentration of density or intensity of land use than authorized within the area, section, or sections, under the current master plan and development regulations. d.    All provisions of the redevelopment plan shall be either substantially consistent with the municipal master plan or designed to effectuate the master plan; but the municipal governing body may adopt a redevelopment plan which is inconsistent with or not designed to effectuate the master plan by affirmative vote of a majority of its full authorized membership with the reasons for so acting set forth in the redevelopment plan. e.     Prior to the adoption of a redevelopment plan, or revision or amendment thereto, the planning board shall transmit to the governing body, within 45 days after referral, a report containing its recommendation concerning the redevelopment plan.  This report shall include an identification of any provisions in the proposed redevelopment plan which are inconsistent with the master plan and recommendations concerning these inconsistencies and any other matters as the board deems appropriate. The governing body, when considering the adoption of a redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof, shall review the report of the planning board and may approve or disapprove or change any recommendation by a vote of a majority of its full authorized membership and shall record in its minutes the reasons for not following the recommendations.  Failure of the planning board to transmit its report within the required 45 days shall relieve the governing body from the requirements of this subsection with regard to the pertinent proposed redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof.  Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the applicability of the provisions of subsection d. of this section with respect to any redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof. f.     The governing body of a municipality may direct the planning board to prepare a redevelopment plan or an amendment or revision to a redevelopment plan for a designated redevelopment area.  After completing the redevelopment plan, the planning board shall transmit the proposed plan to the governing body for its adoption.  The governing body, when considering the proposed plan, may amend or revise any portion of the proposed redevelopment plan by an affirmative vote of the majority of its full authorized membership and shall record in its minutes the reasons for each amendment or revision.  When a redevelopment plan or amendment to a redevelopment plan is referred to the governing body by the planning board under this subsection, the governing body shall be relieved of the referral requirements of subsection e. of this section. (cf: P.L.2021, c.168, s.2). 3. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill enhances certain notice requirements under the "Municipal Land Use Law," P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) and under the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.) in cases involving development proposals  for large warehouses and high-density developments.  Innovation within the warehousing sector has led to the development of much larger warehouses than the types of warehouses built back when many current master plans and zoning ordinances were adopted.  Because of their size and scope of operation, development of these new types of warehouses have resulted in the imposition of significant regional negative impacts throughout New Jersey.  The bill provisions would also become applicable to high-density development proposals. The bill defines the term high-density development to mean development proposed at a greater concentration of density or intensity of land use than authorized within the area, section, or sections, under the current master plan and development regulations. In order to enhance the dialogue among potential warehouse and high-density developers and existing community members, the bill will require developers to provide notice of a hearing on an application proposing the development of a warehouse greater than 100,000 square feet or a high-density development to be given at least 20 days prior to the hearing by the municipal clerk to: · the owners of real property located within the municipality which is the site of the proposed development; and · if the proposed development of a warehouse or high-density development is located within 300 feet of a municipal boundary, to the owners of all real property located within a municipality that is adjacent to the municipality that is the site of the proposed development, and · if the proposed development of a warehouse or high-density development is located within an area designated pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.) as Planning Area 4A (Rural Planning Area) and within and within 1,000 feet of the municipal boundary, to the owners of all real property located within a municipality that is adjacent to the municipality that is the site of the proposed development. Additionally, the bill provides that if a redevelopment plan or subsequent amendments thereof authorizes the development of a warehouse greater than 100,000 square feet or a high-density development, notice is to be given at least 20 days prior to the hearing by the municipal clerk to: the owners of all real property located within the municipality; and if the proposed development is located within 300 feet of a municipal boundary, to the owners of all real property located within a municipality that is adjacent to the municipality that is the site of the proposed development; and if the proposed development of a warehouse or high-density development is located within an area designated pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.) as Planning Area 4A (Rural Planning Area) and within 300 feet of the municipal boundary, to the owners of all real property located within 1,000 feet of the site of the proposed development Under the bill, a municipality or designated redevelopment entity, which provides notice to the owners of real property within the municipality of the hearing on or adoption of a redevelopment plan, or subsequent amendments thereof, authorizing the development of a warehouse greater than 100,000 square feet or a high-density development, may negotiate and collect revenue from a redeveloper to recover the costs of providing such notice.
