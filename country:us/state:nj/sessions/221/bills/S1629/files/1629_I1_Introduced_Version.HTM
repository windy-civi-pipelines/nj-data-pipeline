<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 3 of P.L.1997,
c.349 (C.54:10A-5.30) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  (1)  A taxpayer, upon
approval of the taxpayer's application therefor by the New Jersey Economic
Development Authority and in consultation with the director, shall be allowed a
credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162
(C.54:10A-5), in an amount equal to <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>20<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>30</u>
percent of the qualified investment made by the taxpayer in a New Jersey
emerging technology business, in a New Jersey emerging technology business
holding company that makes a verified transfer of funds to a New Jersey
emerging technology business, or in a qualified venture fund; provided,
however, a taxpayer may be allowed a tax credit in an amount equal to <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>25<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>35</u>
percent of the qualified investment if the taxpayer satisfies one of the
requirements set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The value of tax
credits allowed to a taxpayer pursuant to this section shall not exceed
$500,000 for the privilege period for each qualified investment made by the
taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Subject to the limits
established in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the New Jersey Economic
Development Authority, in consultation with the director, shall increase the
amount of a tax credit allowed pursuant to this section by five percent if the
taxpayer makes a qualified investment in a New Jersey emerging technology
business, or in a New Jersey emerging technology business holding company that
makes a verified transfer of funds to a New Jersey emerging technology
business, or in a qualified venture fund, if the New Jersey emerging technology
business is either located in a qualified opportunity zone pursuant to 26
U.S.C. § 1400Z-1, or a low-income community as defined in subparagraph (e) of 26
U.S.C. § 45D or certified by the State as a minority business or a women's
business pursuant to P.L.1986, c.195 (C.52:27H-21.17 et seq.) and, in the case
of a qualified venture fund, if the qualified venture fund commits by contract
to invest 50 percent of its funds in diverse entrepreneurs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A credit shall not be
allowed pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.175 (C.54:10A-5.24), for expenses
paid from funds for which a credit is allowed, or which are includable in the
calculation of a credit allowed, under this section.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, the order of priority in which the credit allowed by this
section and any other credits allowed by law may be taken shall be as
prescribed by the director.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Except as provided in
subsection d. of this section, the amount of credit otherwise allowable under
this section which cannot be applied for the privilege period against tax
liability otherwise due for that privilege period may either be carried over,
if necessary, to the 15 privilege periods following the privilege period for
which the credit was allowed or, at the election of the taxpayer, be claimed as
and treated as an overpayment for the purposes of R.S.54:49-15, provided,
however, that section 7 of P.L.1992, c.175 (C.54:49-15.1) shall not apply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A taxpayer may not carry
over any amount of credit allowed under subsection a. of this section to a
privilege period during which a corporate acquisition with respect to which the
taxpayer was a target corporation occurred or during which the taxpayer was a
party to a merger or a consolidation, or to any subsequent privilege period, if
the credit was allowed for a privilege period prior to the year of acquisition,
merger or consolidation, except that if in the case of a corporate merger or corporate
consolidation the taxpayer can demonstrate, through the submission of a copy of
the plan of merger or consolidation and such other evidence as may be required
by the director, the identity of the constituent corporation which was the
acquiring person, a credit allowed to the acquiring person may be carried over
by the taxpayer. As used in this subsection, &quot;acquiring person&quot; means
the constituent corporation the stockholders of which own the largest
proportion of the total voting power in the surviving or consolidated
corporation after the merger or consolidation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The Executive Director
of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, in consultation with the
director, shall adopt, pursuant to the &quot;Administrative Procedure
Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations that are
necessary to implement sections 1 through 3 of P.L.1997, c.349 (C.54:10A-5.28
through C.54:10A-5.30) and section 4 of P.L.2013, c.14 (C.54A:4-13), including,
but not limited to: examples of and the determination of qualified investments
of which applicants shall provide documentation with their tax credit
application; the promulgation of procedures and forms necessary to apply for a
credit; provisions for recapture in the event a taxpayer receives a credit on
the basis of its commitment to transfer cash to a qualified venture fund and it
does not fund its commitment; and provisions for credit applicants to be
charged an initial application fee and ongoing service fees to cover the
administrative costs related to the credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The amount of credits approved
by the Executive Director of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, and
in consultation with the director, pursuant to subsection a. of this section
and pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2013, c.14 (C.54A:4-13), shall not exceed a
cumulative total of $35,000,000 in any calendar year to apply against the tax
imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) and the tax
imposed pursuant to the &quot;New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act,&quot; N.J.S.54A:1-1
et seq. If the cumulative amount of credits allowed to taxpayers in a calendar
year exceeds the amount of credits available in that year, then taxpayers who

corporation shall be determined by allocating to each shareholder of the S
corporation that proportion of the tax credit of the S corporation that is
equal to the shareholder's proportionate share of the S corporation, whether or
not distributed, of the total distributive income or gain of the S corporation
for its tax period ending with or within the shareholder's tax period, and the
