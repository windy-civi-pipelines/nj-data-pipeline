According to the OPD, youth custodial sentences are on the rise. In 2022, New Jersey had 277 youth in custody. As of April 4, 2024, there were 339. The OPD notes that the length of stay is also on the rise. For example, in Atlantic County, the length of a custodial sentence for a juvenile has increased by 359 percent between 2022 and 2024. The OPD estimates a 25-30 percent increase in youth defense caseloads in the next fiscal year. P.L.2021, c.383 expanded the mandate of the OPD to require representation of juvenile defendants, many of whom are on the cusp of reentering society as adults. This has resulted in an increase in juvenile cases for the OPD.
