A special charter was granted by the Legislature in 1872, naming the municipality the Village of South Orange, but was repealed upon the enactment of a new special charter in the form of P.L.1977, c.183, changing the name to the Township of South Orange Village.  This bill amends P.L.1977, c.183 to change the municipalitys name to South Orange Village. Additionally, this bill permits the municipal governing body to move its nonpartisan municipal elections to November.  The bill also permits stipends for members of the governing body, consisting of $12,000 for the Mayor, and $8,000 for each council member. Further, this bill removes certain language to make the special charter conform to State law regarding subjects such as vacancies, conflicts of interest, and the powers of governing body members to expel other members of the governing body. Finally, the bill replaces the office of the Village treasurer with the Chief Financial Officers office, replaces the Board of Trustees with the Council, replaces the Village President with the Mayor, replaces the Village counsel with the Village Attorney, incorporates gender-inclusive language throughout the special charter, and makes technical changes throughout the special charter.

This Charter shall take effect on the first day of January next following its approval by the legal voters pursuant to law.]  (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (cf: P.L.1977, c.183, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately, but shall remain inoperative until approved by adoption of an ordinance by the Board of Trustees of the Township of South Orange Village, for that purpose. STATEMENT This bill constitutes special legislation, requested by the Board of Trustees of the Township of South Orange Village in Essex County, to change the municipalitys name from the Township of South Orange Village, to South Orange Village, and to make other changes to the municipalitys special charter. A special charter was granted by the Legislature in 1872, naming the municipality the Village of South Orange, but was repealed upon the enactment of a new special charter in the form of P.L.1977, c.183, changing the name to the Township of South Orange Village.  This bill amends P.L.1977, c.183 to change the municipalitys name to South Orange Village. Additionally, this bill permits the municipal governing body to move its nonpartisan municipal elections to November.  The bill also permits stipends for members of the governing body, consisting of $12,000 for the Mayor, and $8,000 for each council member. Further, this bill removes certain language to make the special charter conform to State law regarding subjects such as vacancies, conflicts of interest, and the powers of governing body members to expel other members of the governing body. Finally, the bill replaces the office of the Village treasurer with the Chief Financial Officers office, replaces the Board of Trustees with the Council, replaces the Village President with the Mayor, replaces the Village counsel with the Village Attorney, incorporates gender-inclusive language throughout the special charter, and makes technical changes throughout the special charter.
