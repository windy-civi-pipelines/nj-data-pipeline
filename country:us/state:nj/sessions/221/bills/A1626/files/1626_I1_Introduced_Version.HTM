<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    a.  The custodian of a

by any person during regular business hours; or in the case of a municipality
having a population of 5,000 or fewer according to the most recent federal decennial

resolution of either or both houses of the Legislature; regulation promulgated
under the authority of any statute or Executive Order of the Governor;

regulation; or federal order. Prior to allowing access to any government
record, the custodian thereof shall redact from that record any information
which discloses the social security number, credit card number, unlisted
telephone number, or driver license number of any person, or the home address,
whether a primary or secondary residence, of any active, formerly active, or
retired judicial officer or prosecutor, and any active, formerly active, or
retired law enforcement officer; except for use by any government agency,
including any court or law enforcement agency, in carrying out its functions,
or any private person or entity acting on behalf thereof, or any private person

with respect to the disclosure of driver information by the New Jersey Motor
Vehicle Commission as permitted by section 2 of P.L.1997, c.188 (C.39:2-3.4);
and except that a social security number contained in a record required by law
to be made, maintained or kept on file by a public agency shall be disclosed
when access to the document or disclosure of that information is not otherwise
prohibited by State or federal law, regulation or order or by State statute,
resolution of either or both houses of the Legislature, Executive Order of the
Governor, rule of court or regulation promulgated under the authority of any
statute or executive order of the Governor.  <u>Prior to allowing access to any
government record, the custodian thereof may be permitted to redact from that
record any information which discloses the mailing address, home address,
whether a primary or secondary residence, phone number, email address, or any
medical, financial, or personal information of a member of the public where the
disclosure thereof would violate the citizens reasonable expectation of
privacy or where disclosure of such personal information may result in
harassment, unwanted solicitation, identity theft, or opportunities for other
criminal acts.</u>  Except where an agency can demonstrate an emergent need, a
regulation that limits access to government records shall not be retroactive in
effect or applied to deny a request for access to a government record that is
pending before the agency, the council or a court at the time of the adoption
of the regulation.</p>

a government record may be purchased by any person upon payment of the fee
prescribed by law or regulation.  Except as otherwise provided by law or
regulation and except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the fee
assessed for the duplication of a government record embodied in the form of
printed matter shall be $0.05 per letter size page or smaller, and $0.07 per
legal size page or larger.  If a public agency can demonstrate that its actual
costs for duplication of a government record exceed the foregoing rates, the
public agency shall be permitted to charge the actual cost of duplicating the
record.  The actual cost of duplicating the record, upon which all copy fees
are based, shall be the cost of materials and supplies used to make a copy of
the record, but shall not include the cost of labor or other overhead expenses
associated with making the copy except as provided for in subsection c. of this
section.  Access to electronic records and non-printed materials shall be
provided free of charge, but the public agency may charge for the actual costs
of any needed supplies such as computer discs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   No fee shall be charged
to a victim of a crime for a copy or copies of a record to which the crime
victim is entitled to access, as provided in section 1 of P.L.1995, c.23
(C.47:1A-1.1). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Whenever the nature,
format, manner of collation, or volume of a government record embodied in the
form of printed matter to be inspected, examined, or copied pursuant to this
section is such that the record cannot be reproduced by ordinary document
copying equipment in ordinary business size or involves an extraordinary
expenditure of time and effort to accommodate the request, the public agency
may charge, in addition to the actual cost of duplicating the record, a special
service charge that shall be reasonable and shall be based upon the actual
direct cost of providing the copy or copies; provided, however, that in the
case of a municipality, rates for the duplication of particular records when
the actual cost of copying exceeds the foregoing rates shall be established in
advance by ordinance.  The requestor shall have the opportunity to review and
object to the charge prior to it being incurred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A custodian shall permit
access to a government record and provide a copy thereof in the medium
requested if the public agency maintains the record in that medium.  If the
public agency does not maintain the record in the medium requested, the
custodian shall either convert the record to the medium requested or provide a
copy in some other meaningful medium.  If a request is for a record: (1) in a
medium not routinely used by the agency; (2) not routinely developed or
maintained by an agency; or (3) requiring a substantial amount of manipulation
or programming of information technology, the agency may charge, in addition to
the actual cost of duplication, a special charge that shall be reasonable and
shall be based on the cost for any extensive use of information technology, or
for the labor cost of personnel providing the service, that is actually
incurred by the agency or attributable to the agency for the programming, clerical,
and supervisory assistance required, or both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Immediate access
ordinarily shall be granted to budgets, bills, vouchers, contracts, including
collective negotiations agreements and individual employment contracts, and
public employee salary and overtime information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The custodian of a
public agency shall adopt a form for the use of any person who requests access
to a government record held or controlled by the public agency.  The form shall
provide space for the name, address, and phone number of the requestor and a
brief description of the government record sought.  The form shall include
space for the custodian to indicate which record will be made available, when
the record will be available, and the fees to be charged.  The form shall also include
the following: (1) specific directions and procedures for requesting a record;
(2) a statement as to whether prepayment of fees or a deposit is required; (3)
the time period within which the public agency is required by P.L.1963, c.73
(C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, to make the record available;
(4) a statement of the requestor's right to challenge a decision by the public
agency to deny access and the procedure for filing an appeal; (5) space for the
custodian to list reasons if a request is denied in whole or in part; (6) space
for the requestor to sign and date the form; (7) space for the custodian to
sign and date the form if the request is fulfilled or denied.  The custodian
may require a deposit against costs for reproducing documents sought through an
anonymous request whenever the custodian anticipates that the information thus
requested will cost in excess of $5 to reproduce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    A request for access to
a government record shall be in writing and hand-delivered, mailed, transmitted
electronically, or otherwise conveyed to the appropriate custodian.  A
custodian shall promptly comply with a request to inspect, examine, copy, or
provide a copy of a government record.  If the custodian is unable to comply
with a request for access, the custodian shall indicate the specific basis
therefor on the request form and promptly return it to the requestor.  The
custodian shall sign and date the form and provide the requestor with a copy
thereof.  If the custodian of a government record asserts that part of a
particular record is exempt from public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73
(C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, the custodian shall delete or
excise from a copy of the record that portion which the custodian asserts is
exempt from access and shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the
record.  If the government record requested is temporarily unavailable because
it is in use or in storage, the custodian shall so advise the requestor and
shall make arrangements to promptly make available a copy of the record.  If a
request for access to a government record would substantially disrupt agency
operations, the custodian may deny access to the record after attempting to
reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that accommodates the interests
of the requestor and the agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Any officer or employee
of a public agency who receives a request for access to a government record
shall forward the request to the custodian of the record or direct the
requestor to the custodian of the record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     (1)  Unless a shorter
time period is otherwise provided by statute, regulation, or executive order, a
custodian of a government record shall grant access to a government record or
deny a request for access to a government record as soon as possible, but not
later than seven business days after receiving the request, provided that the
record is currently available and not in storage or archived.  In the event a
custodian fails to respond within seven business days after receiving a request,
the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the
requestor has elected not to provide a name, address or telephone number, or
other means of contacting the requestor.  If the requestor has elected not to
provide a name, address, or telephone number, or other means of contacting the
requestor, the custodian shall not be required to respond until the requestor
reappears before the custodian seeking a response to the original request.  If
the government record is in storage or archived, the requestor shall be so
advised within seven business days after the custodian receives the request. 
The requestor shall be advised by the custodian when the record can be made
available.  If the record is not made available by that time, access shall be
deemed denied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   During a period declared
pursuant to the laws of this State as a state of emergency, public health
emergency, or state of local disaster emergency, the deadlines by which to
respond to a request for, or grant or deny access to, a government record under
paragraph (1) of this subsection or subsection e. of this section shall not
apply, provided, however, that the custodian of a government record shall make
a reasonable effort, as the circumstances permit, to respond to a request for
access to a government record within seven business days or as soon as possible
thereafter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     A custodian shall post
prominently in public view in the part or parts of the office or offices of the
custodian that are open to or frequented by the public a statement that sets
forth in clear, concise and specific terms the right to appeal a denial of, or
failure to provide, access to a government record by any person for inspection,
examination, or copying or for purchase of copies thereof and the procedure by
which an appeal may be filed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    The files maintained by
the Office of the Public Defender that relate to the handling of any case shall
be considered confidential and shall not be open to inspection by any person
unless authorized by law, court order, or the State Public Defender.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill permits a records
custodian to redact any information which discloses the mailing address, home
address, whether a primary or secondary residence, phone number, email address,
or any medical, financial, or personal information of a citizen.  This bill
would prevent potential malicious use of such personal information and would
protect the privacy of an individual when an open public records act request is
fulfilled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill codifies the
decision of <u>Burnett v. County of Bergen</u>, by protecting information for
which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Email addresses and phone
numbers are a necessity for daily life and the collection of such information
by a government agency has legitimate uses including for emergency alert
systems.  The ability to gain access to many email addresses and other personal
information opens up the residents of New Jersey to unwanted solicitations or
harassing communications and creates opportunities for attempted cybercrime.</p>
