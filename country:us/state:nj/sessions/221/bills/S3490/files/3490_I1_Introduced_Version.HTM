<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning abortion, amending P.L.1991, c.378
and P.L.1971, c.136, and supplementing Title 45 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  Targeted restrictions on
abortion providers, also referred to as TRAP laws, are medically unnecessary
restrictions on abortion providers that are implemented to make delivering and
accessing healthcare more difficult.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  TRAP laws are common in
states hostile to abortion; however, New Jersey still has not updated statutory
law to expressly address these restrictions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Many of these outdated
restrictions have already been revised through regulation by the Board of
Medical Examiner, so New Jersey Legislature must now solidify those updated
regulations into statute in order to secure access to abortion and all
reproductive healthcare now and in the future.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Medically <a
name="_Hlk168920553">unnecessary</a> facility requirements increase the cost of
healthcare delivery, create burdensome barriers to patients trying to access
abortion care, and require the New Jersey Department of Health staff to enforce
regulations that do not improve or promote patient health. Removing unnecessary
requirements would increase and ease access to reproductive health care and
allow providers to focus their resources on the needs of their patients.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Expanding the type of
health care providers who can provide abortion services is critical to
increasing access to safe, timely, affordable and respectful abortion care.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Through regulation,
this expansion has already been in effect in the State since 2021 allowing tens
of thousands of medical professionals to be trained to provide abortion
services. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Therefore, it is in the
best interest of the State to codify the expansion of the types of health care
providers who can provide abortions in the State in order to ensure that people
can access affordable, high quality health care in their own communities by a
provider of their choice and to meet the current and increasing unmet need for
abortion and other reproductive health services and to ensure access to
reproductive health care in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  Section 12 of P.L.2017,
c.136 (C.26: 2H-12) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  a.  No health care
service or health care facility shall be operated unless it shall: (1) possess
a valid license issued pursuant to this act, which license shall specify the
kind or kinds of health care services the facility is authorized to provide;
(2) establish and maintain a uniform system of cost accounting approved by the
commissioner; (3) establish and maintain a uniform system of reports and audits
meeting the requirements of the commissioner; (4) prepare and review annually a
long range plan for the provision of health care services; and (5) establish
and maintain a centralized, coordinated system of discharge planning which
assures every patient a planned program of continuing care and which meets the
requirements of the commissioner which requirements shall, where feasible,
equal or exceed those standards and regulations established by the federal
government for all federally-funded health care facilities but shall not
require any person who is not in receipt of State or federal assistance to be
discharged against his will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  (1) Application for a
license for a health care service or health care facility shall be made upon
forms prescribed by the department.  The department shall charge a single,
nonrefundable fee for the filing of an application for and issuance of a
license and a single, nonrefundable fee for any renewal thereof, and a single,
nonrefundable fee for a biennial inspection of the facility, as it shall from
time to time fix in rules or regulations; provided, however, that no such
licensing fee shall exceed $10,000 in the case of a hospital and $4,000 in the
case of any other health care facility for all services provided by the
hospital or other health care facility, and no such inspection fee shall exceed
$5,000 in the case of a hospital and $2,000 in the case of any other health
care facility for all services provided by the hospital or other health care
facility.  No inspection fee shall be charged for inspections other than
biennial inspections.  Any surgical practice required to apply for licensure by
the department as an ambulatory care facility pursuant to P.L.2017, c.283 shall
be exempt from the initial and renewal license fees required by this section. 
The application shall contain the name of the health care facility, the kind or
kinds of health care service to be provided, the location and physical
description of the institution, and such other information as the department
may require. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A license shall be
issued by the department upon its findings that the premises, equipment,
personnel, including principals and management, finances, rules and bylaws, and
standards of health care service are fit and adequate and there is reasonable
assurance the health care facility will be operated in the manner required by
this act and rules and regulations thereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The department shall
post on its Internet website each inspection report prepared following an
inspection of a residential health care facility, as defined in section 1 of
P.L.1953, c.212 (C.30:11A-1) or licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1
et seq.), that is performed pursuant to this subsection, along with any other
inspection report prepared by or on behalf of the department for such facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If an inspection reveals a
serious health and safety violation at a residential health care facility, the
department shall post the inspection report, including the name of the facility
and the owner of the facility, on its website no later than 72 hours following
the inspection.  If a license of a residential health care facility is
suspended, the department shall post the suspension on its website no later
than 72 hours following the suspension.  The department shall update its
website to reflect the correction of a serious health and safety violation, and
