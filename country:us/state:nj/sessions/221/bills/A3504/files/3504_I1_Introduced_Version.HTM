The bill establishes the Health Care Workers COVID-19 Supplemental Benefits Program Advisory Council in the Division of Workers' Compensation to advise the division and provide recommendations concerning the administration of the program.  The advisory council will be dissolved, and the annual reports by both the council and the commissioner will cease, upon a determination that that all eligible health care workers have received all supplemental benefits to which they are entitled. The bill appropriates from the General Fund to the Second Injury Fund $30,000,000 from the Health Care Workers COVID-19 Supplemental Benefits Program, to be used for the provision of the supplemental benefits and any necessary expenses of the advisory council. The purpose of this legislation is to assist health care workers, whose public service has rendered them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, by alleviating long-term economic hardships due to COVID-19.  The support provided by the bill is especially important in cases where health care workers become unable to work for long periods of time because of persistent, long-term symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19, colloquially known as long COVID.
