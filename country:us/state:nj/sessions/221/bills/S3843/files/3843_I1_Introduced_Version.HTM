<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. Section 1 of P.L.1995,
c.288 (C.17:48-6.15) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. a. A hospital service
corporation contract which provides hospital or medical expense benefits under
which dependent coverage is available shall continue to make that coverage
available for an adult child until the child turns 26 years of age.  A contract
shall not deny coverage for a subscriber's child on the grounds that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  The child was born out of
wedlock;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The child is not claimed
as a dependent on the subscriber's federal tax return; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  The child does not reside
with the subscriber or in the hospital service corporation's service area,
provided that, in the case of a managed care plan, the child complies with the
terms and conditions of the contract with respect to the use of specified
providers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If a child has coverage
through a hospital service corporation contract of a noncustodial parent, the
hospital service corporation shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Provide such information
to the custodial parent as may be necessary for the child to obtain benefits
through the child's noncustodial parent's coverage;</p>

submitted in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection directly to the
custodial parent, the health care provider or the Division of Medical
Assistance and Health Services in the Department of Human Services which
administers the State Medicaid program, as appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     When a parent who is
the subscriber is eligible for dependent coverage and is required by a court or
administrative order to provide health insurance coverage for his child, the
hospital service corporation shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Permit the parent to
enroll his child as a dependent, without regard to any open enrollment
restrictions<u>, including an adult child subject to subsection d. of this
section</u>;</p>

parent, or the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services as the State
Medicaid agency or the Division of Family Development as the State IV-D agency,
in the Department of Human Services, to enroll the child under the contract if
the parent who is the subscriber fails to enroll the child; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Not terminate coverage
of the child unless the parent who is the subscriber provides the hospital
service corporation with satisfactory written evidence that: the court or
administrative order is no longer in effect; or the child is or will be
enrolled in a comparable health benefits plan whose coverage will be effective
on the date of the termination of coverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>d.    Notwithstanding any
law to the contrary, a contract shall provide coverage for an adult child who
is 26 years of age or older if the child is:</u></p>
