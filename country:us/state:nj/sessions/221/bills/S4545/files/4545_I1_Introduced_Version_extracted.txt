Except as otherwise provided pursuant to subsection f. of section 1 of P.L.1997, c.368 (C.18A:40-12.5), the school nurse shall determine that: a.     the designees have been properly trained in the administration of the epinephrine via [a pre-filled auto-injector] an FDA approved mechanism using standardized training protocols established by the Department of Education in consultation with the Department of Health; b.    the parents or guardians of the pupil consent in writing to the administration of the epinephrine via [a pre-filled auto-injector] an FDA approved mechanism by the designees; c.     the board or chief school administrator of a nonpublic school informs the parents or guardians of the pupil in writing that the district and its employees or agents or the nonpublic school and its employees and agents shall have no liability as a result of any injury arising from the administration of the epinephrine to the pupil; d.    the parents or guardians of the pupil sign a statement acknowledging their understanding that the district or nonpublic school shall have no liability as a result of any injury arising from the administration of the epinephrine via [a pre-filled auto-injector] an FDA approved mechanism to the pupil and that the parents or guardians shall indemnify and hold harmless the district and its employees or agents against any claims arising out of the administration of the epinephrine via [a pre-filled auto-injector]  an FDA approved mechanism to the pupil; and e.     the permission is effective for the school year for which it is granted and is renewed for each subsequent school year upon fulfillment of the requirements in subsections a. through d. of this section. The Department of Education, in consultation with the Department of Health, shall require trained designees for students enrolled in a school who may require the emergency administration of epinephrine for anaphylaxis when the school nurse is not available. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the emergency administration of epinephrine via [a pre-filled auto-injector]  an FDA approved mechanism to a pupil for anaphylaxis by the school nurse or other employees designated pursuant to this section when the pupil is authorized to self-administer epinephrine pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.308 (C.18A:40-12.3), or when there is a coexisting diagnosis of asthma, or when a prescription is received from a licensed health care professional for epinephrine coupled with another form of medication, or when the epinephrine is administered pursuant to subsection f. of section 1 of P.L.1997, c.368 (C.18A:40-12.5). (cf: P.L.2015, c.13, s.2) 3. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill modifies current law regulating the method in which epinephrine is administered in schools during emergency circumstances where a pupil is experiencing anaphylaxis. Specifically, the bill amends current law requiring the use of a pre-filled auto-injector mechanism to administer epinephrine in a school setting to allow any FDA approved epinephrine administration mechanism to be used during an in-school anaphylaxis emergency.
