R.S.33:1-25 and R.S.33:1-26.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.33:1-25 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     33:1-25.  No license of any
class shall be issued to any person under the age of  18 years or to any person
who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.  A beneficiary of
a trust who is not otherwise disqualified to hold an interest in a license may
qualify regardless of age so long as the trustee of the trust qualifies and the
trustee shall hold the beneficiary's interest in trust until the beneficiary is
at least the age of majority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each applicant shall submit to
the director the applicant's name, address, fingerprints and written consent
for a criminal history record background check to be performed.  The director
is authorized to receive criminal history record information from the State
Bureau of Identification in the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation consistent with applicable State and federal laws, rules and
regulations.  The applicant shall bear the cost for the criminal history record
background check, including all costs of administering and processing the
check.  The Division of State Police shall promptly notify the director in the
event a current holder of a license or prospective applicant, who was the
subject of a criminal history record background check pursuant to this section,
is arrested for a crime or offense in this State after the date the background
check was performed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In applications by
corporations, except for club licenses, the names and addresses of, and the
amount of stock held by, all stockholders holding 1% or more of any of the
stock thereof, and the names and addresses of all officers and of all members
of the board of directors must be stated in the application, and if one or more
of the officers or members of the board of directors or one or more of the
owners, directly or indirectly, of more than 10% of the stock would fail to
qualify as an individual applicant in all respects, no license of any class
shall be granted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In applications for club
licenses, the names and addresses of all officers, trustees, directors, or
other governing official, together with the names and addresses of all members
of the corporation, association or organization, must be stated in the
application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In applications by
partnerships, the application shall contain the names and addresses of all of
the partners.  No license shall be issued unless all of the partners would
qualify as individual applicants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A photostatic copy of all
federal permits necessary to the lawful conduct of the business for which a
State license is sought and which relate to alcoholic beverages, or other
evidence in lieu thereof satisfactory to the director, must accompany the
license application, together with a deposit of the full amount of the required
license fee, which deposit to the extent of 90% thereof shall be returned to
the applicant by the director or other issuing authority if the application is
denied, and the remaining 10% shall constitute an investigation fee and be
accounted for as other license fees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Every applicant for a license
that is not a renewal of an annual license shall cause a notice of the making
of the application to be published in a form prescribed by rules and
regulations, once per week for two weeks successively in a newspaper printed in
the English language, published and circulated in the municipality in which the
licensed premises are located; but if there shall be no such newspaper, then
the notice shall be published in a newspaper, printed in the English language,
published and circulated in the county in which the licensed premises are
located.  <u>In addition, the applicant shall notify by regular mail any person
who resides within 200 feet of the licensed premises if such premises are
located within this State.</u>  No publication <u>or notice</u> shall be
required with respect to applications for transportation or public warehouse
licenses or with respect to applications for renewal of licenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Division of Alcoholic
Beverage Control shall cause a general notice of the making of annual renewal
applications and the manner in which members of the public may object to the
approving of the applications to be published in a form prescribed by rules and
regulations, once per week from the week of April 1 through the week of June 1
in a newspaper printed in the English language published and circulated in the
counties in which the premises of applicants for renewals of annual licenses
are located.  Any application for the renewal of an annual license shall be
made by May 1, and none shall be approved before May 1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Every person filing an
application for license, renewal of license or transfer of license with a
municipal issuing authority shall, within 10 days of such filing, file with the
director a copy of the application together with a nonreturnable filing fee of
$200.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Applicants for licenses shall
answer questions as may be asked and make declarations as shall be required by
the form of application for license as may be promulgated by the director from
time to time.  All applications shall be duly sworn to by each of the
applicants, except in the case of applicants in the military service of the
United States whose applications may be signed in their behalf by an
attorney-in-fact holding a power of attorney in form approved by the director,
and except in cases of applications by corporations which shall be duly sworn
to by the president or vice-president.  All statements in the applications
required to be made by law or by rules and regulations shall be deemed
material, and any person who shall knowingly misstate any material fact, under
oath, in the application shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  Fraud,
misrepresentation, false statements, misleading statements, evasions or
suppression of material facts in the securing of a license are grounds for
suspension or revocation of the license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of section 26
of P.L.2003, c.117 amendatory of this section shall apply to licenses issued or
transferred on or after July 1, 2003, and to license renewals commencing on or
after July 1, 2003.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2008, c.56, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    R.S.33:1-26 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     33:1-26.  All licenses shall
be for a term of one year from July 1 in each year. The respective fees for any
such license shall be prorated according to the effective date of the license

limited time, not exceeding its term, to the executor, administrator, trustee,

preparation thereof.  Each person seeking to be employed or connected in any
business capacity whatsoever with a licensee shall submit to the director the

the application published once per week for two weeks in a newspaper published
and circulated in the municipality where the licensed premises are to be
located.  If there is no newspaper in the municipality; the notice is to be

transportation or public warehouse licenses, applicants for those licenses are
exempted from the notice requirement in this bill.</p>
