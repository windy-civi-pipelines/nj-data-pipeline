Any request for relief under this section shall be accompanied by a nonreturnable filing fee of $100.00 payable to the director. (cf: P.L.2003, c.199, s.19) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires applicants for State and municipal issued alcoholic beverage licenses, with the exception of transportation or public warehouse licenses, to notify by regular mail any person who resides within 200 feet of the licensed premises if it is located in New Jersey.  Under current law, applicants are required to have a notice of the application published once per week for two weeks in a newspaper published and circulated in the municipality where the licensed premises are to be located.  If there is no newspaper in the municipality; the notice is to be published in a newspaper in the county in which the licensed premises are located.  Since newspaper publication is not required for applications for transportation or public warehouse licenses, applicants for those licenses are exempted from the notice requirement in this bill. Also the bill requires notice by regular mail to any person who resides within 200 feet of the licensed premises in the case of person to person and place to place transfers of alcoholic beverage licenses. These transfers are subject to similar newspaper publication requirements.
