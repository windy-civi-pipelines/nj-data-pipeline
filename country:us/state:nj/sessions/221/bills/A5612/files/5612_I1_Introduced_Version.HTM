<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the New
Jersey Transit Corporation (corporation) to issue citations for covered
violations as evidenced by recorded images captured by bus obstruction
monitoring systems. The bill requires a designated employee of the corporation
or a contracted law enforcement agency to review recorded images for covered violations.
The corporation is required to install and operate bus obstruction monitoring
systems on buses owned and operated by the corporation, or operated under
contract with the corporation, to capture recorded images of motor vehicles
during the commission of a covered violation and to issue citations for covered
violations. The number of buses to be equipped with bus obstruction monitoring
systems is to be determined by the corporation. Under the bill, a bus
obstruction monitoring system may only be used if it is operated by a bus
obstruction monitoring system operator and a sign is affixed to the bus
alerting drivers that the bus is equipped with a bus obstruction monitoring
system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a bus
obstruction monitoring system is to only retain recorded images of motor vehicles
that contain evidence of a covered violation.  Recorded images from a bus
obstruction monitoring system may be retained for up to six months or 60 days
after final disposition of the citation, whichever is later, if the record
images contain evidence of a covered violation.  If the recorded images do not
contain evidence of a covered violation, the covered images are required to be
destroyed within 15 days after the recorded images were first captured.  Recorded
images are to be stored on secured servers or encrypted digital storage systems
that meet or exceed State information security standards established by the New
Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness.  Recorded images are not
deemed a government record and are not to be discoverable as a government
record by any person, entity, or governmental agency, except upon a subpoena
issued by a grand jury or a court order in a criminal matter.  Additionally,
recorded images are not permitted to be offered as evidence in any civil or
administrative proceeding not directly related to a covered violation.  A bus
obstruction monitoring system may not use biometric identification techniques,
including facial recognition technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A bus obstruction monitoring
system operator is required to complete training by the manufacturer of the bus
obstruction monitoring system in the procedures for setting up, testing, and
operating the bus obstruction monitoring system.  Upon completion of the
training, the manufacturer is required to issue a signed certificate to the bus
obstruction monitoring system operator, which certificate is to be admissible
as evidence in any administrative or judicial proceeding for a covered
violation.  In addition, a bus obstruction monitoring system operator is
required to perform manufacturer-specified functionality tests of each bus
obstruction monitoring system prior to the start of daily service and at
regular intervals throughout the day, as required by the manufacturer. Each
test is to confirm proper operation of the camera, time and date stamp,
location tracking, and image capture functions. A bus obstruction monitoring
system operator is also required to complete and sign a test verification log
for each bus obstruction monitoring system, which log is to meet certain
requirements under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, no motor vehicle
is permitted to stop, stand, or park in a dedicated bus lane, bus stop zone, or
designated bicycle lane.  Citations issued by a bus obstruction monitoring
system for a covered violation may be contested on certain grounds as provided
in the bill. An owner or operator of a motor vehicle who received a citation
for a covered violation has 30 days from the date on which the citation was
mailed to contest the alleged covered violation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If an owner or operator of a
motor vehicle violates the bills provisions, as captured by a bus obstruction
monitoring system, the owner or operator of the motor vehicle is subject to a
fine of $45 for the first offense. Subsequent offenses within that 12-month
period are to increase by $45, with a maximum fine of $135 per offense.  The
corporation is permitted to retain any fines collected pursuant to the bill for
the purposes of covering administrative costs of administering the bus
obstruction monitoring system program.  Any excess revenue from fines collected
pursuant to the program is to be used to fund Access Link services.  Additionally,
the corporation is prohibited from entering into any agreement for bus
obstruction monitoring systems or bus obstruction monitoring system operator
services that bases contractor compensation on the amount of revenue generated
in monetary fines collected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Prior to issuing any citations
or fines for covered violations, the corporation is required to issue warning
notices for 60 days following the date that active enforcement is implemented.  The
corporation is required to issue a public announcement regarding the
corporations implementation of the bus obstruction monitoring system and to
provide the public with information about the bus obstruction monitoring system
on the corporations Internet website contemporaneous with the warning notice
period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
corporation to submit an annual report to the Governor and to the Legislature
regarding the bus obstruction monitoring system, which report is to include
certain information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With this bill, the sponsor
intends to enhance safety for passengers boarding and alighting from buses
particularly at designated bus stops, as well as for pedestrians, cyclists, and
micro mobility users who often share curbside and lane space. By keeping bus
stops, bus lanes, and adjacent bike lanes clear of obstructing motor vehicles,
the bill aims to improve transit reliability, reduce delays, and promote safer
and more accessible streets for all users. </p>
