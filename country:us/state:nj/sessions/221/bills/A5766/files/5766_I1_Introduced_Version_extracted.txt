STANLEY District 18 (Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Designates hazelnut as State nut of New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act designating the hazelnut as the State nut of New Jersey. Whereas, Hazelnuts are part of a multi-billion-dollar industry, and the demand for hazelnuts is expected to increase as the popularity of hazelnut-based products, including nut butters, baked goods, and candy, is expected to grow; and Whereas, A majority of the commercially-grown hazelnuts come from parts of Turkey, with smaller amounts originating in Italy and other countries with moderate climates; and Whereas, The United States accounts for five percent of hazelnut production worldwide, and hazelnuts grown in the U.S. come almost exclusively from the Willamette Valley in Oregon; and Whereas, The eastern filbert blight is a fungal disease that can be lethal to commercially-grown hazelnuts or filberts; and Whereas, The eastern filbert blight is found throughout the United States and the disease has prevented New Jersey and states outside of the Pacific Northwest from growing hazelnuts commercially; and Whereas, In 1996, Rutgers University started a research and breeding program to develop hazelnuts resistant to the disease and initiate production in New Jersey and the Mid-Atlantic region; and Whereas, In 2020, Rutgers University released to growers its first hazelnut varieties that are resistant to the eastern filbert blight; and Whereas, The university named the new varieties Raritan, in honor of the river whose banks upon which Rutgers Universitys New Brunswick campus lies, as well as Somerset, Monmouth, and Hunterdon, in honor of some of the first New Jersey counties where the trees are being grown; and Whereas, New Jersey is the first state on the East Coast to grow this cash crop and more than 30 growers have planted more than 100 acres of trees in the State; and Whereas, In recognition of the scientific and economic importance of growing hazelnuts, it is fitting and proper to designate the hazelnut as the State nut; now, therefore, Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. The hazelnut is designated as the State nut. 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill designates the hazelnut as the State nut. Hazelnuts are part of a growing multi-billion-dollar industry and hazelnut products include nut butters, baked goods, and candy.  The United States accounts for five percent of hazelnut production worldwide.  Hazelnuts grown in the U.S. come almost exclusively from the Willamette Valley in Oregon.
