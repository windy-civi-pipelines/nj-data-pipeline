<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 4 of P.L.1993,
c.30 (C.45:22A-46) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    The bylaws of the
association, which shall initially be recorded with the master deed shall
include, in addition to any other lawful provisions, the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     A requirement that all
meetings of the executive board, except conference or working sessions at which
no binding votes are to be taken, shall be open to attendance by all 
association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, and adequate
notice of any such meeting shall be given to all  association members, and
voting-eligible tenants where applicable, in such manner as the bylaws shall
prescribe; except that the executive board may exclude or restrict attendance
at those meetings, or portions of meetings, dealing with  (1) any matter the
disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual
privacy;  (2) any pending or anticipated litigation or contract negotiations; 
(3) any matters falling within the attorney-client privilege, to the extent
that confidentiality is required in order for the attorney to exercise his
ethical duties as a lawyer, or  (4) any matter involving the employment,
promotion, discipline or dismissal of a specific officer or employee of the
association.  At each meeting required under this subsection to be open to all 
association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, the
participation of unit  association members, and voting-eligible tenants where
applicable, in the proceedings or the provision of a public comment session
shall be at the discretion of the executive board, minutes of the proceedings
shall be taken, and copies of those minutes shall be made available to all 
association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, before the
next open meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The method of calling
meetings of association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable,
the percentage of association members, and voting-eligible tenants where
applicable, or voting rights required to make decisions and to constitute a quorum. 
The bylaws may, nevertheless, provide that an individual association member,
and a voting-eligible tenant where applicable, may waive notice of meetings in
writing, or may act by written agreement without meetings.  <u>The executive
board or association shall cause to be delivered, through regular or electronic
mail, or personal delivery, a meeting notice to the homeowners not less than seven
days prior to any meeting.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The manner of
collecting from owners their respective shares of common expenses and the
method of distribution to the owners of their respective shares of common
surplus or such other application of common surplus as may be duly authorized
by the bylaws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1) The method by which
the bylaws may be amended, provided that no amendment shall be effective until
recorded in the same office as the then existing bylaws.  The bylaws may also
provide a method for the adoption, amendment and enforcement of reasonable
administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation, use, maintenance
and enjoyment of the units and of the common elements, including limited common
elements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   If association bylaws
provide for no method of their amendment by a vote of the association members
open to all association members, or only allow association members to amend the
bylaws through a majority vote exceeding a two-thirds majority, then the
association members may amend the bylaws by an affirmative vote of a majority
of the total authorized votes in the association.  If the bylaws do not provide
for a method by which the association members may call a meeting of the
association members to conduct a vote to amend the bylaws or do not contain
provisions concerning the subject matter of subparagraphs (a) through (f) of
this paragraph, then a vote concerning an amendment to the bylaws shall be
conducted as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   fifteen percent of the
association members may request a meeting of the association's membership by
executing a document requesting that a special meeting of the association
membership be held, or if the annual meeting of the association membership is
scheduled to occur within 60 days of the date of the request, then the
amendment vote shall be held at the annual meeting;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   if the vote  is not
scheduled to take place at the annual meeting of the association, the executive
board shall schedule the special meeting of the association membership to occur
within 60 days of the receipt of the request.  Notice of the meeting shall be
provided to the association members and voting-eligible tenants, where
applicable, at least 14 days prior to the date of the meeting.  The special
meeting shall be held at a reasonable time that is likely to permit most
association members to attend;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   the language of the
proposed amendment shall be unambiguous and consistent with applicable law and
with the provisions of the bylaws that are not proposed to be amended, and if
not in such condition shall be revised to satisfy that requirement.  Upon
satisfaction of this requirement, the amendment shall be mailed, hand-delivered
or, if the bylaws permit, electronically delivered, together with the notice of
the meeting to the association membership at least 10 days prior to the
meeting; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   if permitted by the
association's bylaws, the notice of the meeting shall include a proxy ballot or
absentee ballot with instructions for the return of same, which instructions
shall permit facsimile or electronic mail delivery of the proxy ballot or
absentee ballot to the association and shall not require receipt of the proxy or
absentee ballot more than one business day prior to the meeting; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   if a sufficient number
of ballots or proxies are not received at the special or annual meeting to
conclusively determine that the proposed amendment has been approved or
rejected, the meeting shall be adjourned for a period of 30 days, or such
longer period as approved by the association membership by approval of a motion
to extend the vote concerning the amendment, but in no event for longer than 11
months from when the notice of the meeting was sent, and all proxies or ballots
received prior to the extended date shall remain valid if otherwise valid under
the terms of the bylaws; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   when an amendment is
approved, a copy of the approved amendment shall be provided to all association
members, and the association shall promptly record the amendment in the county
recording office where the bylaws were recorded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Paragraph (2) of this
subsection shall not be construed to require a vote to be held on an amendment
to the bylaws that has been voted on in the preceding 12 months of the initial

subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   For the purposes of
paragraph (2) of this subsection, the number of total authorized votes in the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   An executive board shall
not amend the bylaws of an association without a vote of the association
members open to all association members, as provided in the association's
bylaws, or where the bylaws provide for no method of their amendment by a vote
of the association members, or only allow association members to amend the
bylaws through a majority vote exceeding a two-thirds majority, then an
association shall only amend the bylaws pursuant to paragraph (2) of this
subsection, except an executive board may amend the bylaws under the following
circumstances:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   to the extent necessary
to render the bylaws consistent with State, federal or local law; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   after providing notice
to all association members of the proposed amendment, which notice shall
include a ballot to reject the proposed amendment.  Other than an amendment to
render the bylaws consistent with State, federal, or local law, if at least 10
percent of association members vote to reject the amendment within 30 days of
its mailing, the amendment shall be deemed defeated.</p>

executive board or association shall provide, upon request by a unit owner, the
following information: the  roster of current board members; contact
information for each current board member, consisting of a private electronic
mail address by which a board member can be contacted directly by unit owners; board
election dates and application forms for candidacy; the most recently adopted
annual budget; and insurance information for any policy held by an association,
including the names of insurance companies, the name of the broker or provider
of the insurance policy, and any applicable policy numbers.  The association
shall provide the information to the homeowner electronically within one
business day of the submission of the request, or, if the homeowner requests a
paper copy, within two business days of the submission of the request.  When
inspection of an insurance policy is requested by a unit owner, an association
shall provide the homeowner with an electronic copy of the insurance policy
within 24 hours of the submission of the request, or, if the homeowner requests
a paper copy, within two business days of the submission of the request.</u></p>

reasonable times, and written summaries of such records shall be supplied at
least annually to the unit owners or their authorized representatives.  The
failure of the association to permit inspection of its financial records by unit
owners or their authorized representatives entitles any persons prevailing in
an enforcement action to recover reasonable attorney's fees from the person in
control of the books and records who, directly or indirectly, knowingly denied
access to the books and records for inspection.  The records shall include, but
not be limited to (1) a record of all receipts and expenditures; and (2) an
account for each unit owner, designating the name and current mailing address
of the unit owner, the amount of each assessment, the dates on which and amounts
