This bill would also require the owner of a group A or M occupancy, that maintains a public restroom available for use by women, to ensure the installation and maintenance of a sign in the restroom alerting women to the warning signs, causes, and dangers of toxic shock syndrome.  This requirement would only apply to restrooms that include two or more toilets.

This bill is intended to enhance public awareness of toxic shock syndrome, a potentially serious illness that can develop quickly.  Anyone can contract toxic shock syndrome, but women using tampons and similar devices have a higher risk.  Early symptoms may include a low fever, muscle aches, chills, fatigue, and headaches.  As toxic shock syndrome progresses, symptoms may include a high fever, vomiting, rashes, redness of the eyes, lips and tongue, low blood pressure, and mental confusion. Toxic shock syndrome is generally treated with antibiotics. Additionally, the bill directs the Department of Health to prepare and make available on its website informational literature concerning the signs, causes, and dangers of toxic shock syndrome. This bill is named in honor of Madalyn Maddy Massabni, who tragically passed away on March 30, 2017 just days after contracting Toxic Shock Syndrome.  Maddy was a 2016 graduate of Rumson-Fair Haven Regional High School and was just beginning her academic career at Lynn University in Florida.
