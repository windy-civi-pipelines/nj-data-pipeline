The State currently dedicates monies from the Drug Enforcement and Demand Reduction Fund to support the activities of the alliance.  The monies deposited into this fund are collected as surcharges from persons convicted of any crime or offense in this State. The State also requires all monies collected under the Alcoholic beverage tax law, R.S.54:41-1 et seq., from the holders of a restricted brewery license to be dedicated to the GCADA for the support of the alliance. During fiscal years 2022 and 2023, this bill provides that if these dedicated revenues are insufficient to support activities of the alliance, then to the extent permitted by federal law and subject to appropriation by the Legislature, the Governor would be required to make available such federal funding as is necessary to the GCADA, from the monies allocated to the State under the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Pub.L.116-136, the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Pub.L.117-2, or any other financial assistance provided by the federal government to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to support the alliance.
