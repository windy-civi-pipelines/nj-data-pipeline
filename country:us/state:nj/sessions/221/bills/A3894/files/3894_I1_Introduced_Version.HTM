(2)   If an owner or operator has been given notice [of the existence of] that the owner or operator is required to abate a violation of [the act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.) and fails to abate the violation, [he] the owner or operator shall be liable to an additional penalty of not more than $50,000.  If a violation is of a continuing nature, each day during which the violation remains unabated shall not constitute an additional and separate violation for the purposes of the penalty in this paragraph.  Continuing liability for unabated violations of record and unpaid fees or penalties following a change of ownership or tenancy shall be determined in accordance with subsections f. and g. of this section.

Any party filing an appeal with a court of competent jurisdiction regarding violations assessed against property which has been certified as unoccupied pursuant to this section shall file a motion upon the initiation of the appeal requesting expedited consideration of the appeal on the ground that acceleration is warranted because the subject of the appeal involves matters of public safety.  In the event the appeal is granted, the court shall grant the motion to expedite. c.     The commissioner or a local enforcing agency may levy and collect penalties in the amounts set forth in this section, but not in excess of the maximum amounts that the commissioner shall establish by regulation for different types of violations.  If the administrative penalty order has not been satisfied by the 30th day after its issuance, the penalty may be sued for, and recovered by and in the name of the commissioner or the enforcing agency, as the case may be, in a civil action by a summary proceeding under "The Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.) in the Superior Court or municipal court.

(cf: P.L.1983, c.383, s.12) 5.    Section 19 of P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-210) is amended to read as follows: 19.  a.  No person shall: (1)   Obstruct, hinder, delay, or interfere by force or otherwise with the commissioner or any local enforcing agency in the exercise of any power or the discharge of any function or duty under the provisions of [this act] the "Uniform Fire Safety Act," P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.); (2)   Prepare, utter, or render any false statement, report, document, plans, or specification permitted or required under the provisions of [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.); (3)   Render ineffective or inoperative, or fail to properly maintain, any protective equipment or system installed, or intended to be installed, in a building or structure; (4)   Refuse or fail to comply with a lawful ruling, action, order, or notice of the commissioner or a local enforcing agency; or (5)   Violate, or cause to be violated, any of the provisions of [this act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.). b.    (1)  A person who violates or causes to be violated a provision of subsection a. of this section shall be liable to a penalty of not more than $5,000 for each violation.  If a violation of subsection a. of this section is of a continuing nature, each day during which the violation remains unabated after the date fixed in an order or notice for the correction or termination of the continuing violation shall constitute an additional and separate violation, except while an appeal from the order is pending in connection with any property except for those properties which are certified by the fire code official to be unoccupied.  For the purposes of this section, a building may not be certified to be unoccupied unless it has been unoccupied for a period of not less than six months. (2)   If an owner or operator has been given notice [of the existence of] that the owner or operator is required to abate a violation of [the act] P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.) and fails to abate the violation, [he] the owner or operator shall be liable to an additional penalty of not more than $50,000.  If a violation is of a continuing nature, each day during which the violation remains unabated shall not constitute an additional and separate violation for the purposes of the penalty in this paragraph.  Continuing liability for unabated violations of record and unpaid fees or penalties following a change of ownership or tenancy shall be determined in accordance with subsections f. and g. of this section. (3)   An additional $150,000 or the actual cost, whichever is greater, may be imposed as a penalty for the expense to the municipality or fire district of suppressing any fire, directly or indirectly, resulting from the unabated violation and for any other actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by the municipality for the enforcement of the violation.

Any party filing an appeal with a court of competent jurisdiction regarding violations assessed against property which has been certified as unoccupied pursuant to this section shall file a motion upon the initiation of the appeal requesting expedited consideration of the appeal on the ground that acceleration is warranted because the subject of the appeal involves matters of public safety.  In the event the appeal is granted, the court shall grant the motion to expedite. c.     The commissioner or a local enforcing agency may levy and collect penalties in the amounts set forth in this section, but not in excess of the maximum amounts that the commissioner shall establish by regulation for different types of violations.  If the administrative penalty order has not been satisfied by the 30th day after its issuance, the penalty may be sued for, and recovered by and in the name of the commissioner or the enforcing agency, as the case may be, in a civil action by a summary proceeding under "The Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.) in the Superior Court or municipal court.
