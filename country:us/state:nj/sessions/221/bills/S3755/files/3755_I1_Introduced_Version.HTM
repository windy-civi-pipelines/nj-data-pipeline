<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Following a motion by
the department for appointment of a receiver, the court shall proceed in a
summary manner and shall render a judgment on the motion either: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   dismissing the motion
for failure by the department to affirmatively establish the allegations or
because of the affirmative establishment by the owner or provider of a defense

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides protections
for individuals with developmental disabilities by establishing a framework
that allows the Department of Human Services (department) to request the
appointment of a receiver to certain low performing service providers of this community. 
Under the bill, an appointed <span style='color:black'>receiver is to oversee
the management of the provider-managed services, which includes both financial
and operational components, to protect the interests and care of the individuals</span>
with developmental disabilities receiving services.  Absent this bill, the department
must rely on non-performing provider agencies to move for receivership, which creates
substantial risk for care recipients if a provider is failing financially or
otherwise unable or unwilling to remedy dangerous conditions in its programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Similar to authority held by
the States Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Health, this
bill provides the department with authority to make a motion to a court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a receiver for a provider of
services to individuals with development disabilities if:  there exists a
pattern or practice in substantial violation of the standards of health, safety,
or recipient care established under federal, State, or local law, regulations,
or policy; or if any other condition dangerous to life, health, or safety of a
recipient exists.  Under the bill, a recipient means an individual that is both
eligible for Division of Developmental Disabilities services and has received
an applicable service by a provider.  Applicable services include community
residence services, private residential facility services, day habilitation
services, individual supports, or any long-term care services.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill:  sets standards for
a motion to request, and a court order and court proceedings to appoint, a
receiver, as well as the responsibilities and rights of providers and the
department during those proceedings; outlines the authority of the appointed
receiver and the termination of the receivership when the objectives of the
court order are met; establishes a method for the department to request the transfer
of ownership of a site and provider-managed services to a new provider; and
creates standards for provider agency defenses.  These provisions are based on
both existing authority held by the Department of Health for oversight of
licensees, as well as a court order recently used by the department to
successfully wind down a low-performing provider agency of services to
individuals with developmental disabilities.  </p>
