(2)  The retail clinic shall provide a copy of the information specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, at no cost, to patients receiving treatment at the clinic. d.    The State Board of Medical Examiners shall conduct an annual compliance review of each retail health center operating in the State and shall evaluate the clinic to determine whether it continues to comply with the provisions of this act. e.    As used in this section, retail health clinic means a health care facility located within a retail store, supermarket, pharmacy, or similar retail establishment that offers episodic, walk-in care, by a physician or nurse practitioner, for a limited set of acute conditions. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires a retail health clinic operating in this State to develop policies and procedures concerning the services the clinic will provide to patients visiting the clinic for treatment.  The clinic would submit the policies and procedures to the State Board of Medical Examiners (BME) for review and approval, and the BME would establish appropriate timelines for the clinics to follow in their development. Specifically, the policies and procedures developed by a retail clinic would include, at a minimum: requirements that the clinic accredited by an accrediting body; protocols for reporting the loss of accreditation and the reasons for the loss to the BME; guidelines for clinical practice; rules prohibiting the treatment of certain patients; the creation of a list of primary care physicians located in the clinics geographical area who are willing to accept new patients referred by the clinic for treatment; guidelines to identify and limit the number of repeat visits by patients who present with the same medical condition; the establishment of procedures for the referral of patients to, and informing patients about, primary care physicians or other health care facilities, when appropriate; the provision of interpreting services; and requirements that the clinic provide patients and their primary care physicians, at no cost to patients, with copies of medical records and laboratory test results. Under the provisions of the bill, retail health clinics would also be required to post in a conspicuous public place, and provide to patients, at no cost, information: about the treatment services provided by the clinic; notifying patients what to do if their medical needs exceed the scope of services provided by the clinic; specifying patients rights when purchasing prescribed medications or medical supplies if the clinic is located in a retail establishment; and about tobacco use, as determined by the Department of Health (DOH), if the clinic is located in a retail establishment selling tobacco products. The BME would be required to conduct an annual compliance review of each retail health center operating in the State and evaluate the clinic to determine whether it continues to comply with the provisions outlined in the bill. As used in the bill, retail health clinic means a health care facility located within a retail store, supermarket, pharmacy, or similar retail establishment that offers episodic, walk-in care, by a physician or nurse practitioner, for a limited set of acute conditions. In New Jersey, retail health clinics are organized as private physician practices rather than ambulatory care clinics, which are regulated by DOH.  Private physician practices are exempt from State regulation or licensure, and as a result, retail health clinics are not regulated by DOH. Therefore, the intent of this legislation is to establish uniform and consistent standards for retail health clinics in order to ensure continuity of care and promote the appropriate use of such clinics throughout the State.
