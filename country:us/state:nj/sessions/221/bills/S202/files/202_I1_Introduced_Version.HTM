P.L.1985, c.334.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.   (New section)   Sections
1 through 10 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as
this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the Water Resources Protection
Trust Fund Act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.   (New section)   The
Legislature finds and declares that New Jersey, already the most densely
populated state in the nation, continues to experience deterioration of its
water resources, including its rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and
underground aquifers; that these resources, by virtue of their capacity to
sustain substantial reserves of potable water, afford flood protection, serve
as habitat for countless animal, bird, and plant species, purify the air,
provide recreational opportunities, and otherwise promote the environment
necessary for a high quality of life, constitute not only an invaluable and
irreplaceable asset to the present citizens of New Jersey, but also a trust for
future generations; and that, as the steward of that trust, it is incumbent
upon the State to commit itself to the preservation in perpetuity of those
resources indispensable to the continued supply of clean water and to the
health and welfare of its citizens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
and declares that much of the States drinking water infrastructure has aged
past its useful life and is in dire need of repair and replacement; that
failure to repair or replace broken pipes has led to increased water main
breaks and service interruptions, more frequent and costly emergency repairs,
the loss of large quantities of treated drinking water to leakage, and a lack
of sufficient water infrastructure to support local and State economic growth; 
that lead in drinking water infrastructure still threatens the health and
safety of the citizens of the State, especially pregnant women and children;
that a modern and reliable water infrastructure provides the foundation for
healthy communities and a prosperous economy; and that current levels of
federal, State, and local funding are insufficient to ensure the preservation
of the States water resources and to make the necessary improvements to the
States water infrastructure.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature therefore
determines that it is in the public interest to establish a stable source of
funding, based on user fees on water consumption and water diversion, for the
long-term preservation and protection of the State's water resources and the
improvement of its drinking water infrastructure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)    As used
in sections 1 through 10 of
P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Acquisition means the
obtaining of a fee simple or lesser interest in land, including, but not
limited to, a development easement, a conservation restriction or easement, or
any other restriction or easement permanently restricting development, by

State or a local government unit, or devise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Combined sewer overflow
means the discharge of untreated or partially treated stormwater runoff and
wastewater from a combined sewer system into a body of water.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Combined sewer system means
a sewer system designed to carry wastewater at all times, which is also
designed to collect and transport stormwater runoff from streets and other
sources, thereby serving a combined purpose.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Consumptive use means any
use of water diverted from surface or ground waters other than a nonconsumptive
use.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Department means the
Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Diversion or divert means
the taking or impoundment of water from a river, stream, lake, pond, aquifer,
well, other underground source, or other water body, whether or not the water
is returned thereto, consumed, made to flow into another stream or basin, or
discharged elsewhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Fund means the Water

to administer, protect, develop, and maintain water quality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nonconsumptive use means the
use of water diverted from surface or ground waters in such a manner that it is
returned to the surface or ground water at or near the point from which it was
taken without substantial diminution in quantity or substantial impairment of
quality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Person means any individual,
corporation, company, partnership, firm, association, owner, or operator of a
public water system, political subdivision of the State, and any state, or

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Public community water
system means a public water system which serves at least 15 service
connections used by year&#8209;round residents or regularly serves at least 25 year&#8209;round
