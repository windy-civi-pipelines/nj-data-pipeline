<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning the adoption of animals and the sourcing of
animals to animal shelters, pounds, and animal rescue organizations,
supplementing Title 4 of the Revised Statutes, amending P.L.1941, c.151, and
repealing various parts of the statutory law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that it is an important public policy to support
the adoption of homeless animals from animal rescue organizations, animal
shelters, and pounds; that consumers have the right to choose responsible
breeders from whom to purchase healthy cats, dogs, or rabbits; that despite the
consumer protections enacted by the State, pet shops continue to obtain
unhealthy cats and dogs from kitten and puppy mills; that with so many
adoptable cats and dogs available, it is unnecessary to have pet shops continue
to sell cats or dogs; and that rabbits continue to be sold by pet shops in the
spring and often end up abandoned at animal rescues, shelters, or pounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature furthermore
finds and declares that responsible breeders are ones that do not engage in
disreputable practices such as selling puppies sight unseen; that responsible
dog breeders can play a vital role in the effort to stop  the mistreatment that
occurs at puppy mills by offering guidance on the humane breeding and care of
dogs and puppies, and educate prospective buyers about the importance of 
humane breeding and care; that responsible breeders are attentive to the health
of their animals, scrutinize pedigrees, test for genetic disease, and breed animals
in order to improve the health and well-being of offspring in the animals
blood lines; that responsible breeders keep adult animals and the offspring in quarters
that allow for optimal exercise; that they feed the animals nutritious foods
and provide appropriate general and veterinary care; that they interview
prospective owners and sell kittens and puppies with contracts which promise to
take back the cat or dog if the new owner cannot continue to care for the
animal; that responsible breeders do not raise and keep their animals in
inhumane conditions and seldom sell animals to pet stores or ship animals
directly via Internet sales; that unlike responsible breeders, commercial kitten
and puppy mills do not perform adequate genetic screening, or provide proper
housing and veterinary care; that kitten and puppy mills breed large volumes of
kittens and puppies and engage in disreputable practices that are harmful to
the health of the animals they breed and their offspring; that some puppy mills
maintain misleading websites, make false promises, and redirect the public away
from responsible breeders; and that while many kitten and puppy mills in the
United States are not licensed as required by the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA), even those commercial breeder puppy mills that are licensed
by the USDA do not provide humane care because the license only requires
minimal standards for animal care and breeding practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature therefore
determines that it is in the best interest of the citizens of the State to
prohibit the sale of cats, dogs, and rabbits by pet shops; that establishing a
prohibition would close an avenue to the sale of kitten and puppy mill cats and
dogs to consumers; that it is also in the best interest of the citizens of the
State to encourage pet shops to facilitate and achieve more successful
adoptions by collaborating with animal rescue organizations, shelters, and
pounds and showcasing cats and dogs available for adoption; that successful
adoptions would be further supported by veterinary examinations and the
establishment of animal health histories and animal health certificates for
animals being offered for adoption; that responsible breeding would be
encouraged by prohibiting breeders and brokers from receiving compensation from
pet shops, animal rescue organizations, shelters, or pounds to which the
breeders or brokers provide animals; and that it is important to reaffirm
consumer rights under consumer fraud laws and hold all pet dealers responsible
for the health of the animals they sell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     14.  The following sections
are repealed:  Sections 1 through 5, and section 7 of P.L.1999, c.331
(C.56:8-92 through C.56:8-95, C.56:8-96, and C.56:8-97); and sections 3 through

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill repeals the Pet
Purchase Protection Act, P.L.1999, c.336 (C.56:8-92 et seq.) and replaces it
with a prohibition on the sale of cats, dogs, and rabbits by pet shops. The
bill also imposes several other requirements concerning the sale and adoption
of animals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that,
without limiting the prosecution of any other practices which may be unlawful
pursuant to State consumer fraud laws, it would be an unlawful practice and a
violation of State consumer fraud law, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), for
any breeder or broker to knowingly sell a cat or dog that is unfit for
purchase.  The bill defines unfit for purchase as having any disease,
deformity, injury, physical condition, illness or defect which is congenital or
hereditary and severely affects the health of the animal, or which was
manifest, capable of diagnosis or likely contracted on or before the sale and
delivery of the animal to the consumer.  The bill specifies that the death of
an animal within 14 days of its delivery to the consumer, except by death by
accident or as a result of injuries sustained during that period, would be
construed to mean the animal was unfit for purchase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes a
prohibition on the sale of cats, dogs, or rabbits by pet shops.  The bill
authorizes a pet shop to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1) sell or offer for sale any
other type of animal as may be otherwise permitted pursuant to State law or
regulation, or sell or offer for sale pet supplies for any type of animal,
including a cat, dog, or rabbit, if it is licensed by its municipality to do
so; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2) offer, in collaboration with
an animal rescue organization, shelter, or pound, space in the pet shop to
showcase cats, dogs, and rabbits that are available for adoption, provided that
no payment or compensation, monetary or otherwise, is exchanged between the pet
shop and animal rescue organization, shelter, or pound, for the use of the pet
shop or for the adoption of any cat, dog, rabbit, or any other animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits animal
rescue organizations, animal rescue organization facilities, pet shops,
shelters, or pounds from obtaining a cat, dog, or rabbit from a breeder or
broker in exchange for any type of compensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes
additional requirements concerning animal adoptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that, when
the animal is first available for adoption, the animal be examined by a
veterinarian.  The veterinarian is required to establish an animal health
history and issue an animal health certificate based on the examination that
documents the name and address of the examining veterinarian and the health and
condition of the animal, including the health information specified in
subsection b. of section 7 of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the animal
be re-examined and the history and certificate updated accordingly if the
animal is not adopted within 14 days after the initial veterinary examination,
but no more than five days before the animal is released to the adoptive
owner.  The bill requires that the adoptive owner receive a copy of the current
animal health history and animal health certificate of the animal.  The bill
also authorizes charging the adoptive owner a reasonable fee to defray the
costs of the examination and the issuance of the animal health history and
animal health certificate of the animal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)  no provision of the bill
can be construed to alter, diminish, replace, or revoke the requirements for pet
dealers that are not pet shops or the rights of a consumer purchasing an animal
from a pet dealer that is not a pet shop, as may be provided elsewhere in law
or any rule or regulation;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)  any provision of law or
regulation pertaining to pet shops that does not pertain to the sale of cats,
dogs, or rabbits would continue to apply to pet shops; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)  no provision of the bill
can be construed to alter, diminish, replace, or revoke any recourse or remedy
that is otherwise available to a consumer purchasing a cat, dog, rabbit, or any
other type of animal and provided under any other law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies that the
bills provisions cannot be construed to interfere with the implementation of,
or otherwise invalidate, or limit or restrict any municipality, county, local
health agency, or municipal or county board of health from enacting or
enforcing, any law, ordinance, rule, or regulation that places additional
obligations or restrictions on pet shops, pet shop sales, breeders, brokers, or
breeder or broker sales.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes, in
addition to any penalties imposed pursuant to the State consumer fraud law, a
fine of $500 for each violation of the bill, including failing to provide
required information or providing false information, to be collected in a civil
action under the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10
et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill authorizes
the Department of Health and the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs
in the Department of Law and Public Safety to adopt any rules or regulations necessary
to implement the bills provisions.</p>
