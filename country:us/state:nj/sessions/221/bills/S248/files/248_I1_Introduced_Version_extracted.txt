STATEMENT This bill amends current law regarding the "Fishing Buddy License," a reduced fishing license fee for both (1) the existing angler who purchases a license together with a new angler, and (2) the new angler who purchases a license together with an existing angler.  This license is intended to increase fishing participation by rewarding existing anglers for introducing, or reintroducing, people to fishing. Under current law, the "Fishing Buddy License" is available to persons who have not acquired a fishing license after 2010.  This bill would expand the scope of the reduced license fee to include returning anglers as well as new anglers, by allowing the "fishing buddy" license to be acquired by someone who has not acquired a license in the previous five years, on a rolling basis. The bill would take effect on the first December 1st occurring at least six months after the bill's enactment, and authorize the Department of Environmental Protection to take any necessary administrative actions prior to the effective date.
