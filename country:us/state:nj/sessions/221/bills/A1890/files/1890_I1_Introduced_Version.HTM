A1890 ASSEMBLY, No. 1890 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ANNETTE QUIJANO District 20 (Union) SYNOPSIS Requires registration and regulation of certain hemp-derived cannabinoids manufactured and sold in this State. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning certain hemp-derived cannabinoids and amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that psychoactive hemp-derived cannabinoid products, such as foods, supplements, cosmetics, and inhalables, can contain more psychoactive cannabinoid than is lawfully permitted to be sold in unregulated form, and yet such products are being sold in New Jersey, in increasing amounts outside the regulatory structure in place for cannabis and hemp.  Delta-8-THC, a hemp-derived substance that is legal in New Jersey, is an extract of hemp that has psychoactive properties lower than the federal limit of 0.3 percent Delta-9 THC, and, as such, currently is legal.  However, products containing Delta-8-THC are being marketed without adequate notice of content. The THC content in Delta-8-THC products has been found, in independent testing, to be as high as the THC in cannabis products, and these products contain previously unknown isomers and cannabinoids.  Registration, testing, labeling, and other regulatory requirements for hemp-derived cannabinoid products through the New Jersey regulatory structure are necessary to ensure the safety of products sold to the public. The Cannabis Regulatory Commission (the commission) is uniquely positioned to track, through a registration process, hemp-derived cannabinoid product manufactured outside the New Jersey regulatory structure, and establish other safety and testing requirements. 2.  (New section)  As used in this act, unless the context otherwise requires: Artificially derived cannabinoid means a chemical substance that is created by a chemical reaction that changes the molecular structure of any chemical substance derived from the plant Cannabis. Cannabidiol (CBD) means a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis sativa plant.  CBD has  the formula C21H30O2 and chemical structure, inclusive of stereochemical variations. Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) means the cannabinoid having the formula C22H30O4 and chemical structure, inclusive of stereochemical variations.  It is the precursor to cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabinoids means compounds structurally defined as a diverse class of C21 or C22 terpenophenolic compounds found in Cannabis sativa L., their carboxylic acids, analogs, and transformation products. The term is also used in the scientific literature to represent structurally unrelated cannabimimetic compounds. The main cannabinoids found in cannabis plants are Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD).  In addition to THC and CBD, there are more than 100 cannabinoids that could be identified. Cannabis means the Cannabis sativa plant, referred to as cannabis, an umbrella term that includes marijuana and hemp depending on its THC concentration level.  Cannabis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae of which Cannabis sativa is a species, and Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis are subspecies thereof. Cannabimimetic means a compound that is not structurally a cannabinoid, but which can elicit a biological response similar to those produced by cannabinoids by acting directly or indirectly on cannabinoid receptors in the body. Contamination means microbiological, chemical, radiological, or physical substances that either develop in or are added (purposefully or unknowingly) to consumable hemp products or ingredients and are unsafe for human consumption or in violation of a regulatory standard. "CBD" means cannabidiol, a cannabinoid. Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-8-THC) means a psychoactive cannabinoid compound found in the Cannabis sativa plant, but does not occur in naturally significant amounts.  It has the chemical formula C21H30O2 and the chemical structure inclusive of stereochemical variations. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) means a psychoactive cannabinoid compound found in the Cannabis sativa plant, and the primary psychoactive compound found in marijuana. Delta-9-THC is referred to as THC.  THC has the formula C21H30O2 and the chemical structure inclusive of stereochemical variations. Dry weight basis refers to a method of determining the percentage of a chemical in a substance after removing the moisture from the substance. The ratio of the amount of moisture in a sample to the amount of dry solid in a sample. Decarboxylation means a process of treating a cannabis material or product to remove carboxyl groups from the cannabinoids native in the plant, to form transformation products such as THC and CBD.  Decarboxylation is commonly accomplished by application of heat.  Decarboxylation is not considered a synthetic process. Hemp means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with Delta-9. tetrahydrocannabinol concentrations of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. "Hemp-derived cannabinoid" means:  a cannabinoid or an isomer created from such cannabinoid, that is derived from hemp in a concentration of more than one-tenth of one percent (0.1%); or a hemp-derived product containing delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol in a concentration of three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) or less on a dry weight basis. Hemp-derived cannabinoid product means a product derived from hemp with not greater than 0.3 percent Delta-9-THC. "Hemp-derived cannabinoid retailer" means a person or entity that sells products containing a hemp-derived cannabinoid for consumption and not for resale. Intoxicating tetrahydrocannabinols means naturally occurring, synthetically derived, isomerized, or synthetically converted tetrahydrocannabinols which, when consumed, have the potential to induce disturbances in nervous system function and may result in changes in cognition, perception, judgement, mood, consciousness, or behavior, that resolve with time. Isomers are molecules or polyatomic ions with identical molecular formulae  that is, same number of atoms of each element  but distinct arrangements of atoms in space. Isomerization is the process in which a molecule, polyatomic ion or molecular fragment is transformed into an isomer with a different chemical structure. "Manufacturer" means a person or entity that compounds, blends, extracts, infuses, cooks, refines, purifies, converts, synthesizes or otherwise makes or prepares products containing a hemp-derived cannabinoid, including the processes of extraction, infusion, packaging, repackaging, labeling, and relabeling of products containing a hemp-derived cannabinoid. "Proof of age" means a valid driver license or other government-issued identification card that contains a photograph of the person and confirms the person's age as twenty-one (21) years of age or older. Synthetic cannabinoid means a cannabinoid synthesized in a laboratory or by industry using directed synthetic conversion or biosynthetic chemistry rather than traditional food preparation techniques such as heating or extracting. They may be nature-identical or artificial since this definition refers only to the process of their creation. Terpenes means a class of unsaturated hydrocarbons produced predominately in plants built up from isoprene (C5H8)n units. Terpenes are classified by the number of isoprene units or carbons 5 units: monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), sesterterpenes (C25), triterpenes (C30), sesquarterpenes (C35), tetrterpenes (C40), etc. Terpenoids are modified terpenes containing different functional groups and oxidized methyl groups. "Tetrahydrocannabinol" or "THC" means all naturally or artificially derived tetrahydrocannabinols, or any structural, optical or geometric isomers or analogs of tetrahydrocannabinols. This includes, but is not limited to, Delta-1 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta-6 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta 3,4 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta-10 tetrahydrocannabinol, Delta-11 tetrahydrocannabinol; and any other artificially derived cannabinoid that may have an intoxicating or psychoactive effect. THC is a cannabinoid. Tetrahydrocannabiolic acid (THCA) means a naturally occurring cannabinoid compound found in the cannabis sativa plant. THCA is the precursor to THC through decarboxylation. THCA has the chemical formula C22H30O4. "THC" means tetrahydrocannabinol, a cannabinoid. 3.    Section 6 of P.L. 2021, c. 16 (C.24:6I-34) is amended to read as follows: 6.

For purposes of this section, the term "applicant" shall include any owner, director, officer, or employee of a medical cannabis testing laboratory. The commission is authorized to exchange fingerprint data with and receive criminal history record background information from the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation consistent with the provisions of applicable federal and State laws, rules, and regulations.  The Division of State Police shall forward criminal history record background information to the commission in a timely manner when requested pursuant to the provisions of this section. An applicant who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to this section shall submit to being fingerprinted in accordance with applicable State and federal laws, rules, and regulations.  No check of criminal history record background information shall be performed pursuant to this section unless the applicant has furnished the applicant's written consent to that check.  An applicant who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to this section who refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, the securing of a check of criminal history record background information shall not be considered for a license to operate, or authorization to be employed at, a medical cannabis testing laboratory.  An applicant shall bear the cost for the criminal history record background check, including all costs of administering and processing the check. (2)   The commission shall not approve an applicant for a license to operate, or authorization to be employed at, a medical cannabis testing laboratory if the criminal history record background information of the applicant reveals a disqualifying conviction as set forth in subsection c. of this section. (3)   Upon receipt of the criminal history record background information from the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the commission shall provide written notification to the applicant of the applicant's qualification or disqualification for a license to operate or be a director, officer, or employee of a medical cannabis testing laboratory. If the applicant is disqualified because of a disqualifying conviction pursuant to the provisions of this section, the conviction that constitutes the basis for the disqualification shall be identified in the written notice. (4)   The Division of State Police shall promptly notify the commission in the event that an individual who was the subject of a criminal history record background check conducted pursuant to this section is convicted of a crime or offense in this State after the date the background check was performed.  Upon receipt of that notification, the commission shall make a determination regarding the continued eligibility to operate or be a director, officer, or employee of a medical cannabis testing laboratory. (5)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c. of this section to the contrary, the commission may offer provisional authority for an applicant to be an owner, director, officer, or employee of a medical cannabis testing laboratory for a period not to exceed three months if the applicant submits to the commission a sworn statement attesting that the person has not been convicted of any disqualifying conviction pursuant to this section. (6)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c. of this section to the contrary, no applicant to be an owner, director, officer, or employee of a medical cannabis testing laboratory shall be disqualified on the basis of any conviction disclosed by a criminal history record background check conducted pursuant to this section if the individual has affirmatively demonstrated to the commission clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation.  In determining whether clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation has been demonstrated, the following factors shall be considered: (a)   the nature and responsibility of the position which the convicted individual would hold, has held, or currently holds; (b)   the nature and seriousness of the crime or offense; (c)   the circumstances under which the crime or offense occurred; (d)   the date of the crime or offense; (e)   the age of the individual when the crime or offense was committed; (f)   whether the crime or offense was an isolated or repeated incident; (g)   any social conditions which may have contributed to the commission of the crime or offense; and (h)   any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or in the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of those who have had the individual under their supervision. (cf: P.L.2021, c.16, s.29) 7.  (New section)  A retail establishment that offers for sale hemp-derived cannabinoid products before the enactment of P.L.   , c.  (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall have a period of one year from enactment to comply with the provisions of P.L.  c.  (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 8.  This act shall take effect immediately and rules promulgated pursuant to the act shall take effect one year next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT Pursuant to P.L.2019, c.238, known as the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, the New Jersey Department of Agriculture is designated as the primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp in the State.  The department is responsible for promulgating regulation plans under which the State monitors and regulates hemp production, an agricultural crop which the State actively promotes, and which permits farmers and businesses to cultivate, handle and process hemp, and to sell hemp products for commercial purposes (and which is excluded from the definition of a controlled substance due to the presence of hemp or hemp-derived cannabinoids).  Hemp-derived products manufactured outside the regulatory structure, while not illegal in New Jersey, remain unregulated, although chemical conversion processes can make hemp derived cannabinoid products, such as Delta 8, have psychoactive properties similar to the THC in legalized cannabis, and contain unknown but harmful byproducts of the conversion process. This bill establishes the Cannabis Regulatory Commission as the regulatory body for hemp-derived cannabinoids for purposes of registration and sale of hemp-derived cannabinoid products.  The bill further provides for existing laboratories to test hemp-derived cannabinoid products. Section 1. This section contains legislative findings and declarations including the following: hemp-derived cannabinoid products can contain more psychoactive cannabis than is lawfully permitted to be sold in unregulated form, and yet, such products are being sold in New Jersey outside the regulatory structure for cannabis and hemp.  The Cannabis Regulatory Commission is uniquely positioned to implement a regulatory structure, including, tracking through establishing a registration requirement for hemp-derived cannabinoid products manufactured outside the New Jersey regulatory structure, and other health, safety and testing requirements. Section 2.  This section defines key terms which aid in distinguishing cannabinoid products with psychoactive properties from those with non-psychoactive properties.  A key term, cannabinoid means the naturally occurring chemical compound found in cannabis.  The main cannabinoids found in cannabis plants are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which, in simplified terms, is psychoactive, and cannabidiol (CBD) which is non-psychoactive.  Through a conversion process, known as isomerization, legal CBD products, such as Delta-8, have been found to contain psychoactive properties, and potentially harmful byproduct from the conversion process. Since many products are sold in convenience stores and gas stations, the bill targets retail merchants, defined in the bill as hemp-derived cannabinoid retailers, to register products sold through their locations. Section 3.  This section amends N.J.S.A. 24:6I-34, concerned with commission activities associated with the personal use of cannabis, to grant powers which enable the commission to perform duties prescribed in the bill.  Jurisdiction, supervision, duties, functions, and powers are extended to hemp-derived cannabinoid products manufactured outside the New Jersey regulatory structure.  The commission is empowered to regulate the purchase, sale, transportation, and delivery of hemp-derived cannabinoid products in accordance with the provision of this bill, and to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations as necessary.  Subsection d. of this section adds the Commissioner of Agriculture as a consultant agency for the adoption of regulations by the commission. Section 4.  This section establishes specific areas for regulation of hemp-derived cannabinoid products, including registration requirements, permit requirements for hemp-derived cannabinoid retailers, security requirements, age requirements to prevent the sale of hemp-derived cannabinoid products with detectable THC to persons under 21 years of age, labeling and packaging requirements, unannounced visits, and civil penalties for failure to comply with regulations adopted pursuant to the provisions of the bill. Section 5.  This section amends N.J.S.A. 24:6I-17, concerned with the testing of cannabis, to require that samples of cannabinoid product manufactured outside the New Jersey regulatory structure be tested by a laboratory licensed pursuant to N.J.S.A.24:6I-18 (testing laboratories) or pursuant to N.J.S.A.24:6I-35 (cannabis testing laboratories). Section 6.  This section authorizes the testing of hemp-derived cannabinoid products at testing laboratories currently licensed to test medical cannabis and medical cannabis products, usable cannabis, cannabis products, cannabis extracts, and other cannabis resins. Section 7.  This section provides that a retail establishment that offers for sale hemp-derived cannabinoid products prior to the passage of this bill shall have a period of one year from passage to comply with the provisions of the bill. It is not the intention of the sponsor to ban hemp-derived cannabinoids, such as Delta-8, but to require registration of such products, and to impose health and safety requirements through a regulatory structure.

A1890 ASSEMBLY, No. 1890 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ANNETTE QUIJANO District 20 (Union) SYNOPSIS Requires registration and regulation of certain hemp-derived cannabinoids manufactured and sold in this State. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning certain hemp-derived cannabinoids and amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that psychoactive hemp-derived cannabinoid products, such as foods, supplements, cosmetics, and inhalables, can contain more psychoactive cannabinoid than is lawfully permitted to be sold in unregulated form, and yet such products are being sold in New Jersey, in increasing amounts outside the regulatory structure in place for cannabis and hemp.  Delta-8-THC, a hemp-derived substance that is legal in New Jersey, is an extract of hemp that has psychoactive properties lower than the federal limit of 0.3 percent Delta-9 THC, and, as such, currently is legal.  However, products containing Delta-8-THC are being marketed without adequate notice of content. The THC content in Delta-8-THC products has been found, in independent testing, to be as high as the THC in cannabis products, and these products contain previously unknown isomers and cannabinoids.  Registration, testing, labeling, and other regulatory requirements for hemp-derived cannabinoid products through the New Jersey regulatory structure are necessary to ensure the safety of products sold to the public. The Cannabis Regulatory Commission (the commission) is uniquely positioned to track, through a registration process, hemp-derived cannabinoid product manufactured outside the New Jersey regulatory structure, and establish other safety and testing requirements. 2.  (New section)  As used in this act, unless the context otherwise requires: Artificially derived cannabinoid means a chemical substance that is created by a chemical reaction that changes the molecular structure of any chemical substance derived from the plant Cannabis. Cannabidiol (CBD) means a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis sativa plant.  CBD has  the formula C21H30O2 and chemical structure, inclusive of stereochemical variations. Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) means the cannabinoid having the formula C22H30O4 and chemical structure, inclusive of stereochemical variations.  It is the precursor to cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabinoids means compounds structurally defined as a diverse class of C21 or C22 terpenophenolic compounds found in Cannabis sativa L., their carboxylic acids, analogs, and transformation products. The term is also used in the scientific literature to represent structurally unrelated cannabimimetic compounds. The main cannabinoids found in cannabis plants are Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD).  In addition to THC and CBD, there are more than 100 cannabinoids that could be identified. Cannabis means the Cannabis sativa plant, referred to as cannabis, an umbrella term that includes marijuana and hemp depending on its THC concentration level.  Cannabis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae of which Cannabis sativa is a species, and Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis are subspecies thereof. Cannabimimetic means a compound that is not structurally a cannabinoid, but which can elicit a biological response similar to those produced by cannabinoids by acting directly or indirectly on cannabinoid receptors in the body. Contamination means microbiological, chemical, radiological, or physical substances that either develop in or are added (purposefully or unknowingly) to consumable hemp products or ingredients and are unsafe for human consumption or in violation of a regulatory standard. "CBD" means cannabidiol, a cannabinoid. Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-8-THC) means a psychoactive cannabinoid compound found in the Cannabis sativa plant, but does not occur in naturally significant amounts.  It has the chemical formula C21H30O2 and the chemical structure inclusive of stereochemical variations. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) means a psychoactive cannabinoid compound found in the Cannabis sativa plant, and the primary psychoactive compound found in marijuana. Delta-9-THC is referred to as THC.  THC has the formula C21H30O2 and the chemical structure inclusive of stereochemical variations. Dry weight basis refers to a method of determining the percentage of a chemical in a substance after removing the moisture from the substance. The ratio of the amount of moisture in a sample to the amount of dry solid in a sample. Decarboxylation means a process of treating a cannabis material or product to remove carboxyl groups from the cannabinoids native in the plant, to form transformation products such as THC and CBD.  Decarboxylation is commonly accomplished by application of heat.  Decarboxylation is not considered a synthetic process. Hemp means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with Delta-9. tetrahydrocannabinol concentrations of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. "Hemp-derived cannabinoid" means:  a cannabinoid or an isomer created from such cannabinoid, that is derived from hemp in a concentration of more than one-tenth of one percent (0.1%); or a hemp-derived product containing delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol in a concentration of three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) or less on a dry weight basis. Hemp-derived cannabinoid product means a product derived from hemp with not greater than 0.3 percent Delta-9-THC. "Hemp-derived cannabinoid retailer" means a person or entity that sells products containing a hemp-derived cannabinoid for consumption and not for resale. Intoxicating tetrahydrocannabinols means naturally occurring, synthetically derived, isomerized, or synthetically converted tetrahydrocannabinols which, when consumed, have the potential to induce disturbances in nervous system function and may result in changes in cognition, perception, judgement, mood, consciousness, or behavior, that resolve with time. Isomers are molecules or polyatomic ions with identical molecular formulae  that is, same number of atoms of each element  but distinct arrangements of atoms in space. Isomerization is the process in which a molecule, polyatomic ion or molecular fragment is transformed into an isomer with a different chemical structure. "Manufacturer" means a person or entity that compounds, blends, extracts, infuses, cooks, refines, purifies, converts, synthesizes or otherwise makes or prepares products containing a hemp-derived cannabinoid, including the processes of extraction, infusion, packaging, repackaging, labeling, and relabeling of products containing a hemp-derived cannabinoid. "Proof of age" means a valid driver license or other government-issued identification card that contains a photograph of the person and confirms the person's age as twenty-one (21) years of age or older. Synthetic cannabinoid means a cannabinoid synthesized in a laboratory or by industry using directed synthetic conversion or biosynthetic chemistry rather than traditional food preparation techniques such as heating or extracting. They may be nature-identical or artificial since this definition refers only to the process of their creation. Terpenes means a class of unsaturated hydrocarbons produced predominately in plants built up from isoprene (C5H8)n units. Terpenes are classified by the number of isoprene units or carbons 5 units: monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), sesterterpenes (C25), triterpenes (C30), sesquarterpenes (C35), tetrterpenes (C40), etc. Terpenoids are modified terpenes containing different functional groups and oxidized methyl groups. "Tetrahydrocannabinol" or "THC" means all naturally or artificially derived tetrahydrocannabinols, or any structural, optical or geometric isomers or analogs of tetrahydrocannabinols. This includes, but is not limited to, Delta-1 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta-6 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta 3,4 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol; Delta-10 tetrahydrocannabinol, Delta-11 tetrahydrocannabinol; and any other artificially derived cannabinoid that may have an intoxicating or psychoactive effect. THC is a cannabinoid. Tetrahydrocannabiolic acid (THCA) means a naturally occurring cannabinoid compound found in the cannabis sativa plant. THCA is the precursor to THC through decarboxylation. THCA has the chemical formula C22H30O4. "THC" means tetrahydrocannabinol, a cannabinoid. 3.    Section 6 of P.L. 2021, c. 16 (C.24:6I-34) is amended to read as follows: 6.

(5)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c. of this section to the contrary, the commission may offer provisional authority for an applicant to be an owner, director, officer, or employee of a medical cannabis testing laboratory for a period not to exceed three months if the applicant submits to the commission a sworn statement attesting that the person has not been convicted of any disqualifying conviction pursuant to this section. (6)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c. of this section to the contrary, no applicant to be an owner, director, officer, or employee of a medical cannabis testing laboratory shall be disqualified on the basis of any conviction disclosed by a criminal history record background check conducted pursuant to this section if the individual has affirmatively demonstrated to the commission clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation.  In determining whether clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation has been demonstrated, the following factors shall be considered: (a)   the nature and responsibility of the position which the convicted individual would hold, has held, or currently holds; (b)   the nature and seriousness of the crime or offense; (c)   the circumstances under which the crime or offense occurred; (d)   the date of the crime or offense; (e)   the age of the individual when the crime or offense was committed; (f)   whether the crime or offense was an isolated or repeated incident; (g)   any social conditions which may have contributed to the commission of the crime or offense; and (h)   any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or in the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of those who have had the individual under their supervision. (cf: P.L.2021, c.16, s.29) 7.  (New section)  A retail establishment that offers for sale hemp-derived cannabinoid products before the enactment of P.L.   , c.  (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall have a period of one year from enactment to comply with the provisions of P.L.  c.  (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 8.  This act shall take effect immediately and rules promulgated pursuant to the act shall take effect one year next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT Pursuant to P.L.2019, c.238, known as the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, the New Jersey Department of Agriculture is designated as the primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp in the State.  The department is responsible for promulgating regulation plans under which the State monitors and regulates hemp production, an agricultural crop which the State actively promotes, and which permits farmers and businesses to cultivate, handle and process hemp, and to sell hemp products for commercial purposes (and which is excluded from the definition of a controlled substance due to the presence of hemp or hemp-derived cannabinoids).  Hemp-derived products manufactured outside the regulatory structure, while not illegal in New Jersey, remain unregulated, although chemical conversion processes can make hemp derived cannabinoid products, such as Delta 8, have psychoactive properties similar to the THC in legalized cannabis, and contain unknown but harmful byproducts of the conversion process. This bill establishes the Cannabis Regulatory Commission as the regulatory body for hemp-derived cannabinoids for purposes of registration and sale of hemp-derived cannabinoid products.  The bill further provides for existing laboratories to test hemp-derived cannabinoid products. Section 1. This section contains legislative findings and declarations including the following: hemp-derived cannabinoid products can contain more psychoactive cannabis than is lawfully permitted to be sold in unregulated form, and yet, such products are being sold in New Jersey outside the regulatory structure for cannabis and hemp.  The Cannabis Regulatory Commission is uniquely positioned to implement a regulatory structure, including, tracking through establishing a registration requirement for hemp-derived cannabinoid products manufactured outside the New Jersey regulatory structure, and other health, safety and testing requirements. Section 2.  This section defines key terms which aid in distinguishing cannabinoid products with psychoactive properties from those with non-psychoactive properties.  A key term, cannabinoid means the naturally occurring chemical compound found in cannabis.  The main cannabinoids found in cannabis plants are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which, in simplified terms, is psychoactive, and cannabidiol (CBD) which is non-psychoactive.  Through a conversion process, known as isomerization, legal CBD products, such as Delta-8, have been found to contain psychoactive properties, and potentially harmful byproduct from the conversion process. Since many products are sold in convenience stores and gas stations, the bill targets retail merchants, defined in the bill as hemp-derived cannabinoid retailers, to register products sold through their locations. Section 3.  This section amends N.J.S.A. 24:6I-34, concerned with commission activities associated with the personal use of cannabis, to grant powers which enable the commission to perform duties prescribed in the bill.  Jurisdiction, supervision, duties, functions, and powers are extended to hemp-derived cannabinoid products manufactured outside the New Jersey regulatory structure.  The commission is empowered to regulate the purchase, sale, transportation, and delivery of hemp-derived cannabinoid products in accordance with the provision of this bill, and to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations as necessary.  Subsection d. of this section adds the Commissioner of Agriculture as a consultant agency for the adoption of regulations by the commission. Section 4.  This section establishes specific areas for regulation of hemp-derived cannabinoid products, including registration requirements, permit requirements for hemp-derived cannabinoid retailers, security requirements, age requirements to prevent the sale of hemp-derived cannabinoid products with detectable THC to persons under 21 years of age, labeling and packaging requirements, unannounced visits, and civil penalties for failure to comply with regulations adopted pursuant to the provisions of the bill. Section 5.  This section amends N.J.S.A. 24:6I-17, concerned with the testing of cannabis, to require that samples of cannabinoid product manufactured outside the New Jersey regulatory structure be tested by a laboratory licensed pursuant to N.J.S.A.24:6I-18 (testing laboratories) or pursuant to N.J.S.A.24:6I-35 (cannabis testing laboratories). Section 6.  This section authorizes the testing of hemp-derived cannabinoid products at testing laboratories currently licensed to test medical cannabis and medical cannabis products, usable cannabis, cannabis products, cannabis extracts, and other cannabis resins. Section 7.  This section provides that a retail establishment that offers for sale hemp-derived cannabinoid products prior to the passage of this bill shall have a period of one year from passage to comply with the provisions of the bill. It is not the intention of the sponsor to ban hemp-derived cannabinoids, such as Delta-8, but to require registration of such products, and to impose health and safety requirements through a regulatory structure.
