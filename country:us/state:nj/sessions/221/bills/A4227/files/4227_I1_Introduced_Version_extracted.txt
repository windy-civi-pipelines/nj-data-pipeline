(l)    Installation, repair or maintenance performed by regular employees of the State or of a municipality, county, or school district on the premises or property owned or occupied by the State, a municipality, county, or school district; provided that a regular employee of the State, municipality, county or school district performing this work is a Class A journeyman electrician licensed pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2001, c.21 (C.45:5A-11.1), or holds any civil service title with a job description which includes electrical work pursuant to the "Civil Service Act," N.J.S.11A:1-1 et seq., or regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or any employee of a State authority who has completed an apprenticeship training program approved by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship Training, that deals specifically with electrical work, and is of a minimum duration of three years. Any regular employee of the State, or of a municipality, county or school district who has submitted his application to the board for licensure as a Class A journeyman electrician shall be permitted to continue to perform work pursuant to this subsection until such time as the board acts upon his application.  Any applicant whose licensure application is not approved by the board shall no longer be permitted to perform electrical work pursuant to this subsection. (m)  The maintaining, installing or connecting of automatic oil, gas or coal burning equipment, gasoline or diesel oil dispensing equipment and the lighting in connection therewith to a supply of adequate size at the load side of the distribution board, or the replacement of an electric water heater with one of similar size and voltage not to exceed 240 volts or less with a disconnecting means at the load side of the distribution board or service disconnect located within sight of the equipment, or for the replacement of a service disconnect and whip serving a replacement air conditioning condensing unit not exceeding 240 volts or less with one of a similar size and voltage requirements.

(q)   Any work performed by a person certified pursuant to sections 1 through 10 of P.L.2001, c.289 (C.52:27D-25n through C.52:27D-25w) that is not branch circuit wiring.  For the purposes of this subsection, "branch circuit wiring" means the circuit conductors between the final overcurrent device protecting the circuit and one or more outlets.  A certificate holder shall be deemed to have engaged in professional misconduct for the purposes of section 8 of P.L.1978, c.73 (C.45:1-21) for violating the provisions of this subsection. (r)    Any work performed by an alarm business, as that term is defined by section 2 of P.L.1985, c.289 (C.45:5A-18.1), licensed pursuant to P.L.1997, c.305 (C.45:5A-23 et seq.) that is not branch circuit wiring.  For the purposes of this subsection, "branch circuit wiring" means the circuit conductors between the final overcurrent device protecting the circuit and one or more outlets.  A licensee shall be deemed to have engaged in professional misconduct for the purposes of section 8 of P.L.1978, c.73 (C.45:1-21) for violating the provisions of this subsection. The board may also exempt from the business permit provisions of this act such other electrical activities of like character which in the board's opinion warrant exclusion from the provisions of this act. (cf: P.L.2021, c.479, s.10) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following the date of enactment, and shall apply to contracts initiated for services on or after the effective date of this act. STATEMENT This bill exempts licensed master plumbers in the State from certain business permit requirements under the law governing electrical contractors concerning certain electric water heaters and air conditioning units.  Electric water heaters are among the most common types of water heaters in New Jersey and the United States, and are increasing in popularity due to their cost and energy efficiency.  Electric air conditioning condensing units are also very popular appliances. Licensed master plumbers in New Jersey possess the skills and training necessary to replace these appliances, but under current law these plumbers would need to hold a New Jersey master electricians license to perform such work.  By exempting licensed New Jersey master plumbers from needing a business permit from the Board of Examiners of Electrical Contractors, this bill frees those plumbers to perform additional tasks.  This less burdensome requirement will provide costs savings to customers by increasing competition for plumbing services and plumbers by removing a costly and unnecessary regulatory requirement.
