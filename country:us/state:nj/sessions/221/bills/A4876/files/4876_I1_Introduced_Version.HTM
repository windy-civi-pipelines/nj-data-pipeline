<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  a.  A
municipality may use school bus video camera footage to assist in the
enforcement of section 1 of P.L.1942, c.192 (C.39:4-128.1).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In any municipality in
which recorded images from a school bus video camera are used to assist in the
enforcement of section 1 of P.L.1942, c.192 (C.39:4-128.1), a law enforcement
official of the municipality shall review the recorded images produced by the
video camera.  In conducting the review, the law enforcement official shall
determine whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a violation of
section 1 of P.L.1942, c.192 (C.39:4-128.1) has occurred and shall issue,
within 90 days from the date on which the violation occurred, a summons when it
is deemed appropriate.  A school bus video camera summons issued pursuant to
this section shall be served by a law enforcement official in accordance with
the Rules of Court. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the
recorded images produced by the school bus video camera shall be available for
the exclusive use of any law enforcement official for the purposes of
discharging the official's duties pursuant to P.L.2007, c.348 (C.39:4-8.12 et
seq.).  Any recorded image or information produced in connection with a school
bus video camera shall not be deemed a public record under P.L.1963, c.73
(C.47:1A-1 et seq.) or the common law concerning access to public records.  The
recorded images shall not be discoverable as a public record by any person,
entity, or governmental agency, except upon a subpoena issued by a grand jury
or a court order in a criminal matter, nor shall they be offered in evidence in
any civil or administrative proceeding not directly related to a violation of
section 1 of P.L.1942, c.192 (C.39:4-128.1).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any recorded image or
information produced by a school bus video camera in connection with a specific
violation of section 1 of P.L.1942, c.192 (C.39:4-128.1) shall be purged and
not retained for more than 60 days after the collection of any fine or
penalty.  If a law enforcement official does not issue a summons for a
violation within 90 days, all recorded images and information collected
pertaining to that alleged violation shall be purged within three days.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Except as provided in
subsection d. of this section, the owner and operator shall be jointly liable
for a summons issued pursuant to subsection a. of this section, unless the
owner can show that the vehicle was used without his consent, express or implied. 
An owner who pays any fine, penalty, costs or administrative fees in connection
with a summons issued pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall have the
right to recover that sum from the operator in a court of competent
jurisdiction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The owner of a motor
vehicle who is a lessor shall not be liable for a summons issued pursuant to
subsection a. of this section when the motor vehicle is under the control or in
the possession of the lessee, if upon notice of a summons issued, the owner of
the motor vehicle which was leased at the time of the offense notifies the
clerk of the court where the case is pending, by an affidavit of the name and
address of the lessee.  The affidavit shall be in a form prescribed by the
Administrative Director of the Courts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After providing the name and
address of the lessee, the owner shall not be required to attend a hearing of
the offense, unless otherwise notified by the court. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In no case shall motor
vehicle points or automobile insurance eligibility points pursuant to section
26 of P.L.1990, c.8 (C.17:33B-14) be assessed against any person liable for a
summons issued under the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A person liable for a
summons issued shall be subject to: (1) a fine of $100 for a first offense, and
(2) a fine of $250 for each subsequent offense.  The penalties shall be
enforced and recovered pursuant to the provisions of chapter 5 of Title 39 of
the Revised Statutes.  There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the
registered owner of the vehicle which was involved in the violation of this
section was the person who committed the act. Any person who suppresses, by way
of concealment or destruction, any evidence of a violation of this section or
who suppresses the identity of the violator shall be subject to a fine of $100.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    For purposes of this
section, school bus means any vehicle equipped with a crossing arm, pursuant
to P.L.1996, c.96 (C.39:3B-1.1 et seq.).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 1 of P.L.1942,
c.192 (C.39:4-128.1) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    On highways having
roadways not divided by safety islands or physical traffic separation
installations, the driver of a vehicle approaching or overtaking a bus, which
is being used for the transportation of children to or from school or a summer
day camp or any school connected activity, or which is being used for the
transportation of a person who has a developmental disability, and which has
stopped for the purpose of receiving or discharging any child or a person who
has a developmental disability, shall stop such vehicle not less than 25 feet
from such school bus and keep such vehicle stationary until such child or
person who has a developmental disability has entered said bus or has alighted
and reached the side of such highway and until a flashing red light is no
longer exhibited by the bus; provided, such bus is designated as a school bus
by one sign on the front and one sign on the rear, with each letter on such
signs at least four inches in height.</p>
