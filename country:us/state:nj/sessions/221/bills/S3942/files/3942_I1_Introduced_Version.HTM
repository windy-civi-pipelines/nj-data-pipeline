<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Students who are l<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>esbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer,
questioning, intersex, or asexual, or who otherwise are not heterosexual or
cisgender (LGBTQIA+) face unique challenges at school, including bullying,
discrimination, and lack of access to supportive resources.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>b.    National data shows that LGBTQIA+ students face higher rates of
bullying and harassment at school, are suspended nationwide at a higher rate,
and are four times more likely to attempt suicide compared to their non-LGBTQIA+
peers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     c.     These
challenges have a profound impact on LGBTQIA+ students mental health, academic
performance, and overall wellbeing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     d.    Like
all students, LGBTQIA+ students have the right to a safe, supportive learning
environment that is free from discrimination and harassment, and that provides
equal access to educational opportunities, regardless of their sexual
orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     e.     In
2019, New Jersey became one of the first states to require that students learn
about the political, economic, and social contributions of lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgender figures. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     f.     On
June 17, 2024, Governor Murphy signed </span>Executive Order No. 361
establishing an Advisory Commission on Advancing LGBTQIA+ Youth Equity and
Inclusion in Schools, which is to be composed of executive branch
representatives and members appointed by the Governor.  This commission is to
provide advice to the executive branch to support the Department of Educations
efforts to advance LGBTQIA+ equity in schools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The Legislature strongly
supports the executive branchs commitment to ensuring inclusive school
environments for LGBTQIA+ students. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    It is altogether fitting
and proper to establish a permanent commission to study these issues to ensure LGBTQIA+
students are shielded from discrimination in New Jerseys schools. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  The <span
style='color:black'>Advisory Commission on Advancing LGBTQIA+ Youth Equity and
Inclusion in Schools</span> is created and established in the Executive Branch
of the State Government.  For the purposes of complying with the provisions of
Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, the
commission is allocated within the Department of Education, but notwithstanding
this allocation, the commission shall be independent of any supervision or
control by the department or any board or officer thereof.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commission shall
consist of 25 members as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   <span style='color:black'>the
Commissioners of Education, Children and Families, Health, and Human Services,
ex officio, or their designees;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the Attorney General, ex
officio, or a designee; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   <span style='color:black'>the
former chairperson of the Anti-Bullying Task Force appointed pursuant to
P.L.2019, c.179;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   four public members
appointed by the President of the Senate and four public members appointed by
the Speaker of the General Assembly, all of whom shall have demonstrated
expertise in issues relating to the work of the commission; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   11 public members
appointed by the Governor, including: two representatives from the New Jersey
Education Association; one representative from the New Jersey School Boards
Association; one representative from the New Jersey Principals and Supervisors
Association; one representative from the New Jersey School Counselor
Association; one representative from the New Jersey Association of School
Librarians; one representative from the American Federation of Teachers New
Jersey; one representative from <span style='color:black'>Garden State
Equality; one representative from the Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice;
one representative from the Center for Social Justice Education and LGBT
Communities at Rutgers University; and one representative from the
Intercultural Center at Monmouth University. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Appointments to the
commission shall be made within 30 days after the effective date of this act.  To
the greatest extent practicable, at the time of appointment, the initial members
shall be members of the Advisory Commission on Advancing LGBTQIA+ Youth Equity
and Inclusion in Schools established pursuant to Executive Order No. 361 of
2024.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Each public member of
the commission shall serve a term of four years, except that of the initial
members: one member appointed by the President of the Senate, one member
appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly, and two members appointed by
the Governor shall serve for terms of two years; one member appointed by the
President of the Senate, one member appointed by the Speaker of the General
Assembly, and four members appointed by the Governor shall serve for terms of three
years; and two members appointed by the President of the Senate, two members
appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly, and five members appointed by
the Governor shall serve for terms of four years.  Public members shall be
eligible for reappointment and shall serve until their successors are appointed
and qualified.  The term of the successor of any incumbent shall be calculated
from the expiration of the term of that incumbent.  A vacancy occurring other
than by expiration of term shall be filled in the same manner as the original
appointment, but for the unexpired term only.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The members of the
commission shall serve without compensation, but shall be entitled to
reimbursement for all necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their
duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  The commission shall
organize as soon as practicable following the appointment of its members.  The
commission shall annually elect a chairperson from among its members.  It shall
meet upon the call of the chair or of a majority of the commission members. 
The presence of a majority of the authorized membership of the commission shall
be required for the conduct of official business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commission shall
appoint an executive director, who shall serve at its pleasure and shall be a
person qualified by training and experience to perform the duties of the
office.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The commission is
authorized to call upon any department, office, division, or agency of the
State, or of any county, municipality, or school district of the State, to
supply data, program reports and other information, personnel, and assistance
as it deems necessary to discharge its responsibilities under this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    These departments,
offices, divisions, and agencies shall, to the extent possible, and not
inconsistent with any other law of this State, cooperate with the commission
and shall furnish it with information, personnel, and assistance as may be
necessary or helpful to accomplish the purposes of this act.</p>

0pt'>LGBTQIA+ students face unique challenges at school, including bullying,
discrimination, and lack of access to supportive resources.  Over the years,
the State has implemented various initiatives to create inclusive school
environments.  On June 17, 2024, Governor Murphy signed </span>Executive Order
No. 361 establishing an executive branch Advisory Commission on Advancing
LGBTQIA+ Youth Equity and Inclusion in Schools.  This commission is to provide
advice to the executive branch to support Department of Educations efforts to
advance LGBTQIA+ equity in schools.  The Legislature strongly supports the
executive branchs commitment to ensuring inclusive school environments for
LGBTQIA+ students. <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>It is the sponsors intent
to establish a </span>permanent commission to study these issues and recommend
legislation to ensure LGBTQIA+ students are shielded from discrimination in New
Jerseys schools.</p>
