An Act concerning grants for deer fencing, supplementing P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), and amending P.L.2021, c.451. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  (New section) Notwithstanding any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) to the contrary, a person who leases land acquired for farmland preservation purposes and actively engages in the use of that land for agricultural or horticultural purposes shall be eligible to apply to the committee for a farmland stewardship deer fencing grant made available with funding allocated by the committee for stewardship activities pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 8 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-50), provided the lessee has written approval to install deer fencing on the land from the owner of the land on which the deer fencing is to be installed. 2.  Section 1 of P.L.2021, c.451 (C.4:20-6.1) is amended to read as follows: 1. a.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.451, s.1) 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes the eligibility of lessees of farmland to apply for deer fencing grants pursuant to the State Agriculture Development Committees farmland stewardship deer fencing grant program, established pursuant to P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), and the Department of Agricultures matching grant program, established pursuant to P.L.2021, c.451 (C.4:20-6.1).  In order to be eligible for a grant, the bill would require a lessee of farmland to obtain written approval from the land owner. The bill also revises P.L.2021, c.451 to specify that the agreement required between the owner, operator, or lessee of the farm and the Department of Agriculture is not required to be filed as a deed restriction with the municipal tax assessor and recorded with the county clerk in the same manner as a deed.  In addition, the bill provides for the repayment of an awarded grant, or portion thereof, if the owner, operator, or lessee of a farm awarded a grant either does not retain the land in agricultural or horticultural production, or the owner sells the land, prior to the expiration of the eight-year period established in the agreement with the Department of Agriculture.
