(1) The commission shall require each applicant seeking a permit to operate as, to be a director, officer, or employee of, or to be a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant to undergo a criminal history record background check. Any individual seeking to become a director, officer, or employee of a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant, after issuance of an initial permit shall notify the commission and shall complete a criminal history record background check and provide all information as may be required by the commission as a condition of assuming a position as director, officer, or employee of the permitted entity.  An individual who secures an investment interest or gains the authority to make controlling decisions in a permitted entity that makes the individual a significantly involved person shall notify the commission, complete a criminal history record background check, and provide all information as may be required by the commission no later than 30 days after the date the individual becomes a significantly involved person, or any permit issued to the individual or group of which the significantly involved person is a member shall be revoked and the individual or group shall be deemed ineligible to hold any ownership or investment interest in a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant for a period of at least two years, commencing from the date of revocation, and for such additional period of time as the commission deems appropriate, based on the duration of the nondisclosure, the size of the individual's or group's investment interest in the permitted entity, the amount of profits, revenue, or income realized by the individual or group from the permitted entity during the period of nondisclosure, and whether the individual had a disqualifying conviction or would otherwise have been deemed ineligible to be a significantly involved person in a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant. For purposes of this section, the term "applicant" shall include any owner, director, officer, or employee of, and any significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant.  The commission is authorized to exchange fingerprint data with and receive criminal history record background information from the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation consistent with the provisions of applicable State and federal laws, rules, and regulations.  The Division of State Police shall forward criminal history record background information to the commission in a timely manner when requested pursuant to the provisions of this section. An applicant who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to this section shall submit to being fingerprinted in accordance with applicable State and federal laws, rules, and regulations.  No check of criminal history record background information shall be performed pursuant to this section unless the applicant has furnished the applicant's written consent to that check.  An applicant who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to this section who refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, the securing of a check of criminal history record background information shall not be considered for a permit to operate, or authorization to be employed at or to be a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant.  An applicant shall bear the cost for the criminal history record background check, including all costs of administering and processing the check. (2) The commission shall not approve an applicant for a permit to operate, or authorization to be employed at or to be a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant if the criminal history record background information of the applicant reveals a disqualifying conviction as set forth in subsection c. of this section. (3) Upon receipt of the criminal history record background information from the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the commission shall provide written notification to the applicant of the applicant's qualification or disqualification for a permit to operate or be a director, officer, or employee of, or a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant. If the applicant is disqualified because of a disqualifying conviction pursuant to the provisions of this section, the conviction that constitutes the basis for the disqualification shall be identified in the written notice. (4) The Division of State Police shall promptly notify the commission in the event that an individual who was the subject of a criminal history record background check conducted pursuant to this section is convicted of a crime or offense in this State after the date the background check was performed.  Upon receipt of that notification, the commission shall make a determination regarding the continued eligibility to operate or be a director, officer, or employee of, or a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c. of this section to the contrary, the commission may offer provisional authority for an applicant to be an owner, director, officer, or employee of, or a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant for a period not to exceed three months if the applicant submits to the commission a sworn statement attesting that the person has not been convicted of any disqualifying conviction pursuant to this section. (6) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c. of this section to the contrary, no applicant to be an owner, director, officer, or employee of, or a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant shall be disqualified on the basis of any conviction disclosed by a criminal history record background check conducted pursuant to this section if the individual has affirmatively demonstrated to the commission clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation.  In determining whether clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation has been demonstrated, the following factors shall be considered: (a) the nature and responsibility of the position which the convicted individual would hold, has held, or currently holds; (b) the nature and seriousness of the crime or offense; (c) the circumstances under which the crime or offense occurred; (d) the date of the crime or offense; (e) the age of the individual when the crime or offense was committed;

(1) The commission shall require each applicant seeking a permit to operate as, to be a director, officer, or employee of, or to be a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant to undergo a criminal history record background check. Any individual seeking to become a director, officer, or employee of a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant, after issuance of an initial permit shall notify the commission and shall complete a criminal history record background check and provide all information as may be required by the commission as a condition of assuming a position as director, officer, or employee of the permitted entity.  An individual who secures an investment interest or gains the authority to make controlling decisions in a permitted entity that makes the individual a significantly involved person shall notify the commission, complete a criminal history record background check, and provide all information as may be required by the commission no later than 30 days after the date the individual becomes a significantly involved person, or any permit issued to the individual or group of which the significantly involved person is a member shall be revoked and the individual or group shall be deemed ineligible to hold any ownership or investment interest in a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant for a period of at least two years, commencing from the date of revocation, and for such additional period of time as the commission deems appropriate, based on the duration of the nondisclosure, the size of the individual's or group's investment interest in the permitted entity, the amount of profits, revenue, or income realized by the individual or group from the permitted entity during the period of nondisclosure, and whether the individual had a disqualifying conviction or would otherwise have been deemed ineligible to be a significantly involved person in a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant. For purposes of this section, the term "applicant" shall include any owner, director, officer, or employee of, and any significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant.  The commission is authorized to exchange fingerprint data with and receive criminal history record background information from the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation consistent with the provisions of applicable State and federal laws, rules, and regulations.  The Division of State Police shall forward criminal history record background information to the commission in a timely manner when requested pursuant to the provisions of this section. An applicant who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to this section shall submit to being fingerprinted in accordance with applicable State and federal laws, rules, and regulations.  No check of criminal history record background information shall be performed pursuant to this section unless the applicant has furnished the applicant's written consent to that check.  An applicant who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to this section who refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, the securing of a check of criminal history record background information shall not be considered for a permit to operate, or authorization to be employed at or to be a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant.  An applicant shall bear the cost for the criminal history record background check, including all costs of administering and processing the check. (2) The commission shall not approve an applicant for a permit to operate, or authorization to be employed at or to be a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant if the criminal history record background information of the applicant reveals a disqualifying conviction as set forth in subsection c. of this section. (3) Upon receipt of the criminal history record background information from the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the commission shall provide written notification to the applicant of the applicant's qualification or disqualification for a permit to operate or be a director, officer, or employee of, or a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant. If the applicant is disqualified because of a disqualifying conviction pursuant to the provisions of this section, the conviction that constitutes the basis for the disqualification shall be identified in the written notice. (4) The Division of State Police shall promptly notify the commission in the event that an individual who was the subject of a criminal history record background check conducted pursuant to this section is convicted of a crime or offense in this State after the date the background check was performed.  Upon receipt of that notification, the commission shall make a determination regarding the continued eligibility to operate or be a director, officer, or employee of, or a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c. of this section to the contrary, the commission may offer provisional authority for an applicant to be an owner, director, officer, or employee of, or a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant for a period not to exceed three months if the applicant submits to the commission a sworn statement attesting that the person has not been convicted of any disqualifying conviction pursuant to this section. (6) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c. of this section to the contrary, no applicant to be an owner, director, officer, or employee of, or a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant shall be disqualified on the basis of any conviction disclosed by a criminal history record background check conducted pursuant to this section if the individual has affirmatively demonstrated to the commission clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation.  In determining whether clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation has been demonstrated, the following factors shall be considered: (a) the nature and responsibility of the position which the convicted individual would hold, has held, or currently holds; (b) the nature and seriousness of the crime or offense; (c) the circumstances under which the crime or offense occurred; (d) the date of the crime or offense; (e) the age of the individual when the crime or offense was committed; (f)  whether the crime or offense was an isolated or repeated incident; (g) any social conditions which may have contributed to the commission of the crime or offense; and (h) any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or in the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of those who have had the individual under their supervision. e.   The commission shall issue a permit to operate or be an owner, director, officer, or employee of, or a significantly involved person in, a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, or medical cannabis dispensary if the commission finds that issuing such a permit would be consistent with the purposes of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.) and the requirements of this section and section 11 of P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-7.1) are met.  The denial of an application shall be considered a final agency decision, subject to review by the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.  A permit to operate a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, or medical cannabis dispensary issued on or after the effective date of P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-5.1 et al.) shall be valid for one year and shall be renewable annually. f.    A person who has been issued a permit pursuant to this section or a clinical registrant permit pursuant to section 13 of P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-7.3) shall display the permit at the front entrance to the premises of the permitted facility at all times when the facility is engaged in conduct authorized pursuant to P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.) involving medical cannabis, including, but not limited to, the cultivating, manufacturing, or dispensing of medical cannabis. g.   A medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant shall report any change in information to the commission not later than 10 days after such change, or the permit shall be deemed null and void. h.   Each medical cannabis dispensary and clinical registrant shall maintain and make available on its Internet website, if any, a standard price list that shall apply to all medical cannabis, medical cannabis products, and related supplies and paraphernalia sold or dispensed by the medical cannabis dispensary or clinical registrant, which prices shall be reasonable and consistent with the actual costs incurred by the medical cannabis dispensary or clinical registrant in connection with acquiring and selling, transferring, or dispensing the medical cannabis or medical cannabis product and related supplies and paraphernalia.  The prices charged by the medical cannabis dispensary or clinical registrant shall not deviate from the prices indicated on the entity's current price list, provided that a price list maintained by a medical cannabis dispensary or clinical registrant may allow for medical cannabis to be made available at a reduced price or without charge to qualifying patients who have a demonstrated financial hardship, as that term shall be defined by the commission by regulation.  A price list required pursuant to this subsection may be revised no more than once per month, and each medical cannabis dispensary and clinical registrant shall be responsible for ensuring that the commission has a copy of the facility's current price list.  A medical cannabis dispensary or clinical registrant shall be liable to a civil penalty of $1,000 for each sale that occurs at a price that deviates from the entity's current price list, and to a civil penalty of $10,000 for each week during which the entity's current price list is not on file with the commission.  Any civil penalties collected by the commission pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the "Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Fund" established under section 41 of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-50), and used by the commission for the purposes of administering the State medical cannabis program. i.    The commission shall adopt regulations to: (1) require such written documentation of each delivery or dispensation of cannabis to, and pickup of cannabis for, a registered qualifying patient, including the date and amount dispensed, and, in the case of delivery, the date and times the delivery commenced and was completed, the address where the medical cannabis was delivered, the name of the patient or caregiver to whom the medical cannabis was delivered, and the name, handler certification number, and delivery certification number of the medical cannabis handler who performed the delivery, to be maintained in the records of the medical cannabis dispensary or clinical registrant, as the commission determines necessary to ensure effective documentation of the operations of each medical cannabis dispensary or clinical registrant; (2) monitor, oversee, and investigate all activities performed by medical cannabis cultivators, medical cannabis manufacturers, medical cannabis dispensaries, and clinical registrants; (3) ensure adequate security of all facilities 24 hours per day and security of all delivery methods to registered qualifying patients; and (4) establish thresholds for administrative action to be taken against a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant and its employees, officers, investors, directors, or governing board pursuant to subsection m. of this section, including, but not limited to, specific penalties or disciplinary actions that may be imposed in a summary proceeding. j.    (1) Each medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, and clinical registrant shall require the owners, directors, officers, and employees at the permitted facility to complete at least eight hours of ongoing training each calendar year.  The training shall be tailored to the roles and responsibilities of the individual's job function, and shall include training on confidentiality and such other topics as shall be required by the commission. (2) Each medical cannabis dispensary and clinical registrant shall consider whether to make interpreter services available to the population served, including for individuals with a visual or hearing impairment.  The commission shall provide assistance to any medical cannabis dispensary or clinical registrant that seeks to provide such services in locating appropriate interpreter resources.  A medical cannabis dispensary or clinical registrant shall assume the cost of providing interpreter services pursuant to this subsection. k. (1) The first six alternative treatment centers issued permits following the effective date of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.) shall be authorized to sell or transfer such permit and other assets to a for-profit entity, provided that:  the sale or transfer is approved by the commission; each owner, director, officer, and employee of, and significantly involved person in, the entity seeking to purchase or receive the transfer of the permit, undergoes a criminal history record background check pursuant to subsection d. of this section, provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require any individual to undergo a criminal history record background check if the individual would otherwise be exempt from undergoing a criminal history record background check pursuant to subsection d. of this section; the commission finds that the sale or transfer of the permit would be consistent with the purposes of P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.); and no such sale or transfer shall be authorized more than one year after the effective date of P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-5.1 et al.).  The sale or transfer of a permit pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to the requirements of the "New Jersey Nonprofit Corporation Act," N.J.S.15A:1-1 et seq., provided that, prior to or at the time of the sale or transfer, all debts and obligations of the nonprofit entity are either paid in full or assumed by the for-profit entity purchasing or acquiring the permit, or a reserve fund is established for the purpose of paying in full the debts and obligations of the nonprofit entity, and the for-profit entity pays the full value of all assets held by the nonprofit entity, as reflected on the nonprofit entity's balance sheet, in addition to the agreed-upon price for the sale or transfer of the entity's alternative treatment center permit.  Until such time as the members of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission are appointed and the commission first organizes, the Department of Health shall have full authority to approve a sale or transfer pursuant to this paragraph. (2) The sale or transfer of any interest of five percent or more in a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant permit shall be subject to approval by the commission and conditioned on the entity that is purchasing or receiving transfer of the interest in the medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant permit completing a criminal history record background check pursuant to the requirements of subsection d. of this section. l.    No employee of any department, division, agency, board, or other State, county, or local government entity involved in the process of reviewing, processing, or making determinations with regard to medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant permit applications shall have any direct or indirect financial interest in the cultivating, manufacturing, or dispensing of medical cannabis or related paraphernalia, or otherwise receive anything of value from an applicant for a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant permit in exchange for reviewing, processing, or making any recommendations with respect to a permit application. m.  In the event that a medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant fails to comply with any requirements set forth in P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.) or any related law or regulation, the commission may invoke penalties or take administrative action against the medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant and its employees, officers, investors, directors, or governing board, including, but not limited to, assessing fines, referring matters to another State agency, and suspending or terminating any permit held by the medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, or clinical registrant.  Any penalties imposed or administrative actions taken by the commission pursuant to this subsection may be imposed in a summary proceeding.
