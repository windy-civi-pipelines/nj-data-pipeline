<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes several
procedures by which a plenary retail consumption license, generally issued to bars
and restaurants, may be transferred to another municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black'>Under
current law, a municipality may issue plenary retail consumption licenses until
the combined total number in the municipality is fewer than one license for
each 3,000 municipal residents.  This bill allows a municipality that is
entitled to issue an additional plenary retail consumption license to </span>offer
the license at public sale to the highest bidding governing body of any other
municipality in this State.   A license transferred to a receiving municipality
pursuant to this section only is to be used in connection with a premises as
part of an economic redevelopment plan or located within a redevelopment,
improvement, or revitalization area.  The bill requires the host municipality
to provide notice of the public sale to the director and other municipalities
at least 90 days prior to the sale.  The notice to the municipalities is to specify
the minimum acceptable bid and general conditions of sale including a statement
that the transferring municipality reserves the right to reject all bids where
the highest bid is not accepted.  The funds derived from the sale are to be
remitted to the municipal treasurer for the general use of the host municipality.
A receiving municipality that acquires the license would be entitled to offer
the license at public sale.  A license issued by the receiving municipality to
a qualified bidder that is not actively used in connection with the operation
of a premises within two years of the issuance date is to expire and not be
reissued by the receiving municipality.  The receiving municipality would be
prohibited from acquiring more than one license through this bidding process in
each calendar year.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     In
addition, this bill establishes two procedures for transferring an inactive
plenary retail consumption license to a different municipality.  Under current
law, an inactive plenary retail consumption license is a license to sell
alcoholic beverages for on premises consumption that is not being used at an open
and operating licensed premises.  A licensee is required to place the license
on inactive status when the licensed business ceases operation and the
license continues to be held by the licensee of record.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     Under
this bill, a license that remains inactive for two years is to expire.  Prior
to the expiration of the license, the license holder may apply to the governing
body of the host municipality that issued the license and a contiguous
neighboring municipality </span>to use the license in connection with a premises
located in the contiguous receiving municipality.  An inactive plenary retail
consumption license used in a contiguous receiving municipality only would be
used as part of an economic redevelopment plan or in connection with a premises
located within a redevelopment, improvement, or revitalization area.  The bill
requires the transferred license to remain in the contiguous receiving
municipality and prohibits the transfer of the license to any other
municipality.  <span style='color:black'>Under the bill, the </span>host and
receiving municipalities are to submit to the director notice of the intent to
transfer a license at least 90 days prior to the transfer. The bill requires
the host and receiving municipalities to adopt by majority vote identical
resolutions authorizing the transfer of the license.  The identical resolutions
are to establish the license transfer fee agreed upon by both municipal
governing bodies.  A receiving municipality that acquires a license would be
entitled to offer the license at public sale in accordance with current law.  A
license issued by a receiving municipality that is not actively used in
connection with the operation of a premises within two years of the transfer
date would expire and not be reissued by the receiving municipality.  The bill
prohibits a receiving contiguous municipality from acquiring more than one
license through this transfer process in each calendar year.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also allows a
receiving municipality that has reached the license population limitation
established under current law to issue a request for proposal (RFP) to acquire
an inactive plenary retail consumption license from any license holder in this State.
The bill requires the receiving municipality to issue the license for use in
connection with a premises as part of economic redevelopment plan or a
redevelopment, improvement, or revitalization area. The RFP would <span
style='color:black'>specify a time and date after which no further applications
from license holders will be accepted.  The municipality is to publish the RFP
in a newspaper circulating generally throughout the State by not less than two
insertions, one week apart, the second of which is to be made not less than 30
days prior to the time and date specified in the notice as the time and date
after which no further applications will be accepted.  In addition, the request
for proposal is to be published by the governing body on the official Internet
website of the receiving municipality.   The RFP is to require that all bids to
be sealed and remain confidential to other bidders.  The holder of an inactive
plenary retail consumption license is to apply for permission to transfer the
inactive plenary retail consumption license from the host municipality prior to
submitting a bid in response to the RFP.  </span>The host municipality may
approve the application by resolution.<span style='color:black'>  The host
municipality would be prohibited from requiring the applicant to disclose the
location of the proposed licensed premises.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     After
the receiving municipality accepts a successful bid, t</span>he host and
receiving municipality are to submit to the ABC director notice of the intent
to transfer a license at least 90 days prior to the transfer. The bill requires
the issuing and receiving municipalities to adopt by majority vote identical
resolutions authorizing the transfer of the license.  The identical resolutions
are to establish the license transfer fee agreed upon by both municipal
governing bodies. The bill requires a license that is not actively used within
two years of issuance date to expire.  A receiving municipality that issued the
RFP would be prohibited from acquiring more than one license through this process
in each calendar year.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill
establishes a procedure by which existing plenary retail distribution licenses
may be converted to plenary retail consumption licenses as part of an economic
redevelopment plan or for use in a redevelopment, improvement, or
revitalization area.  Under current law, a plenary retail distribution license
allows for the sale of alcoholic beverages off the licensed premises and is
generally issued to liquor stores and supermarkets.  The procedure allows the
holder of a plenary retail distribution license to apply to a host municipality
and receiving municipality located in the same county to transfer the
distribution license to the receiving municipality.  Upon receiving the
distribution license, the receiving municipality would be required to convert
the plenary retail distribution license to a plenary retail consumption license
and then issue that license at public sale in accordance with current law.  The
bill requires the issuing and receiving municipalities to adopt by majority
vote identical resolutions authorizing the transfer of the license.  The bill
prohibits a receiving municipality from acquiring and converting more than one
distribution license through this transfer process in each calendar year.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also allows a person
who held a seasonal retail consumption license prior to the bills effective
date to surrender the license to the issuing authority, which then may exchange
the license for a plenary retail consumption license.  This license will permit
the licensee to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed
premises throughout the entire year. <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Under
current law, a seasonal retail consumption license allows for the sale of
alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption for a limited time during the
summer or winter season. A license issued during the summer season allows the
licensee to serve alcoholic beverages from May 1 through November 14.  The
holder of a winter seasonal license may sell alcoholic beverages from November
15 to April 30. This bill allows a seasonal </span>retail consumption license<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'> to convert the license to a full-year consumption
license and requires the licensee to pay the fees associated with the full-year
license.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The plenary retail consumption
licenses transferred to or acquired by a receiving municipality under the
bills provisions would not be included in the population formula used to issue
new licenses.</p>
