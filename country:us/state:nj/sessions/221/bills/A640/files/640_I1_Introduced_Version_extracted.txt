(cf: P.L.1996, c.73, s.5) 12.  This act shall take effect immediately, but shall remain inoperative until July 1, 2015. STATEMENT This bill increases financial assistance to urban enterprise zones (UEZs) over a seven-year period, by dedicating from the beginning of Fiscal Year 2016 to the end of Fiscal Year 2022, one half of one penny for every dollar of sales tax revenues, as increased annually, in the sales tax of goods and services in UEZs subject to the tax, to the accounts held in the Urban Enterprise Zone Assistance Fund (UEZ Assistance Fund) in the name of the respective municipalities having UEZs.  The bill ends all UEZ Assistance fund appropriations to UEZs at the end of the seven-year period and thereafter dedicates all sales tax collection revenues in UEZs to the General Fund.  In doing so, the bill deletes the schedule of financial assistance to UEZs and municipalities having UEZs as provided in current law but continues the 20-year original designation period as well as the one-time 16-year extension period for qualified UEZs.  The bill increases the sales tax in UEZs from 3.5 percent to seven percent over the seven-year period to provide funding to UEZs from the UEZ Assistance Fund. The bill requires UEZs to contribute an increasing percentage from at least 10 percent in Fiscal Year 2016, to at least 40 percent in Fiscal Year 2020 and thereafter, of UEZ funds to be spent on eligible capital projects and public improvements in UEZs and grant and loan programs for qualified UEZ businesses. Further, under the same designation period as for UEZs, the bill increases the amount of the reduced sales tax collected by qualified businesses located in UEZ-impacted business districts.

A municipality that has created a district pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1995, c.173 (C.40A:12A-52), in which there is an area designated as an urban enterprise zone in which the receipts of certain sales are exempt to the extent [of 50%] provided in section 9 of P.L. , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) of the tax imposed under the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.), [pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-80),] may for the purpose of increasing public revenue adopt an ordinance to levy and collect, within the district, a franchise assessment not to exceed three percent of gross receipts and to devote the proceeds from those assessments to municipal purposes as provided in this section. b.    The rate of the franchise assessment shall be uniform throughout the district.  The franchise assessment shall apply only within the territorial limits of the district and shall be in addition to any other assessments, taxes, and excises. c.    The ordinance shall be a valid and binding ordinance of the municipality.  The ordinance shall continue in force and effect until repealed by the governing body.  The municipality may also provide and covenant by ordinance that the ordinance authorizing the franchise assessment will not be amended so as to repeal or reduce the franchise assessment while bonds issued pursuant to P.L.1995, c.173 (C.40A:12A-50 et seq.) and [this amendatory and supplementary act,] P.L.1996, c.73 (C.40A:12A-50a et al.) are outstanding, unless the resolution authorizing the bonds shall provide otherwise.  [Such] The covenant shall constitute a valid and legally binding contract between the municipality and bondholders. d.    [No] A franchise assessment shall not be imposed on gross receipts which the municipality or the State is prohibited from taxing under New Jersey law, or the Constitution and laws of the United States of America. e.    Upon adoption, the municipal clerk shall immediately transmit a copy of the ordinance to the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs and to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  Every ordinance levying a franchise assessment pursuant to this section shall provide for reporting assessments due and for the collection thereof, and all franchise assessments pursuant to [such an] that ordinance shall be remitted to the chief financial officer of the municipality.  An ordinance levying a franchise assessment shall take effect only on the first day of any month in any year.  The ordinance shall provide for the allocation and distribution of the proceeds of the franchise assessments collected; provided, however, that only [such] sums as are retained by the municipality pursuant to the ordinance shall be included in the general funds of the municipality and all other franchise assessment proceeds shall be held in trust for the payment or reimbursement of costs or obligations incurred for the purposes of the district. f.     The ordinance shall set forth the person or persons subject to the franchise assessment payment and collection procedures, and any other matters deemed relevant by the municipality with the municipality having discretion as to the mechanism to be utilized.  The ordinance shall also contain findings that the imposition of the franchise assessment is necessary because of the substantial risks undertaken to develop a landfill reclamation improvement district, and to offset loss of revenues by the municipality because of its assignment of payments in lieu of taxes. g.    The ordinance shall provide for the collection of the franchise assessment by an officer of the municipality who shall be designated in the ordinance; shall provide methods for enforcement; and may provide penalties for the violation of any of the provisions of the ordinance. h.    All revenues collected under the ordinance and retained by the municipality pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the general fund of the municipality and may be used for general municipal purposes, including the payment of salaries, construction, reconstruction, maintenance, and repair of municipal buildings, installations and properties, and for [such] other purposes as may be provided by existing ordinances or ordinances hereafter enacted for general municipal purposes. (cf: P.L.1996, c.73, s.5) 12.  This act shall take effect immediately, but shall remain inoperative until July 1, 2015. STATEMENT This bill increases financial assistance to urban enterprise zones (UEZs) over a seven-year period, by dedicating from the beginning of Fiscal Year 2016 to the end of Fiscal Year 2022, one half of one penny for every dollar of sales tax revenues, as increased annually, in the sales tax of goods and services in UEZs subject to the tax, to the accounts held in the Urban Enterprise Zone Assistance Fund (UEZ Assistance Fund) in the name of the respective municipalities having UEZs.  The bill ends all UEZ Assistance fund appropriations to UEZs at the end of the seven-year period and thereafter dedicates all sales tax collection revenues in UEZs to the General Fund.  In doing so, the bill deletes the schedule of financial assistance to UEZs and municipalities having UEZs as provided in current law but continues the 20-year original designation period as well as the one-time 16-year extension period for qualified UEZs.  The bill increases the sales tax in UEZs from 3.5 percent to seven percent over the seven-year period to provide funding to UEZs from the UEZ Assistance Fund. The bill requires UEZs to contribute an increasing percentage from at least 10 percent in Fiscal Year 2016, to at least 40 percent in Fiscal Year 2020 and thereafter, of UEZ funds to be spent on eligible capital projects and public improvements in UEZs and grant and loan programs for qualified UEZ businesses. Further, under the same designation period as for UEZs, the bill increases the amount of the reduced sales tax collected by qualified businesses located in UEZ-impacted business districts.
