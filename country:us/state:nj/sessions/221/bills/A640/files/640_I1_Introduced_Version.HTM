increased annually, in the sales tax of goods and services in UEZs subject to
the tax, to the accounts held in the Urban Enterprise Zone Assistance Fund (UEZ

UEZs to the General Fund.  In doing so, the bill deletes the schedule of
financial assistance to UEZs and municipalities having UEZs as provided in
current law but continues the 20-year original designation period as well as
the one-time 16-year extension period for qualified UEZs.  The bill increases

period to provide funding to UEZs from the UEZ Assistance Fund.</p>

grant and loan programs for qualified UEZ businesses.</p>
