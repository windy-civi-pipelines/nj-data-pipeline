CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act establishing grants to financial nonprofit organizations that provide financial literacy education. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    As used in this act: Commissioner means the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. Financial education courses means any on-line or in-person education module, any comprehensive set of videos, or any self-guided learning tool which provides education on personal finance topics as defined by this bill. Financial nonprofit organizations means any 501(c)(3) or similarly certified organization whose primary focus is providing consumer financial counseling, debt management, or financial literacy programs. 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that having the knowledge and capability to manage personal finances enables citizens to make better financial decisions and creates a foundation for long-term stability at both home and the workplace.  The ability to develop a personal budget, manage debt, create savings, along with the understanding how to finance large purchases such a residence or an automobile, provides an important knowledge base and can be the catalyst to the removal of barriers which prevent a fuller participation in the economy.  However, there is a shortage of availability of personal finance classes within public schools, post-secondary education, and adult education.

STATEMENT This bill requires the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance to establish a program to provide grants to nonprofit organizations that provide financial literacy classes. Many citizens have limited knowledge in the concepts of personal budgeting, investing, and managing debt. This lack of knowledge can hinder their abilities to secure credit for major purchases and save for retirement. The bill addresses the lack of opportunities for education in personal finance by creating a grant program for financial nonprofits to develop and provide personal finance courses, with the goal of broadening the reach of financial education.  Individual grants under the program are capped at $5,000. The bill appropriates $100,000 from the General Fund.
