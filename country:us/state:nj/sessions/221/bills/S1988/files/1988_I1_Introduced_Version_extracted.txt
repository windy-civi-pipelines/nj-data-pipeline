Nothing contained in this section, however, shall be deemed to prohibit the downgrading of an offense at any time if the prosecution of the greater offense was commenced within the statute of limitations applicable to the greater offense. e.     The period of limitation does not run during any time when a prosecution against the accused for the same conduct is pending in this State. f.     The limitations in this section shall not apply to any person fleeing from justice. g.    Except as otherwise provided in this code, no civil action shall be brought pursuant to this code more than five years after such action accrues. (cf: P.L.2007, c.131, s.1). 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall be applicable to all offenses not yet barred from prosecution under the statute of limitations as of the effective date. STATEMENT This bill would eliminate the statute of limitations for prosecution for the crime of human trafficking. Currently, under the provisions of N.J.S.2C:1-6 there is no statute of limitations for prosecutions for the following crimes: murder; manslaughter; sexual assault; and criminal offenses arising from violations of certain environmental statutes concerning widespread injury or damage. Prosecution for other crimes, such as human trafficking, must be commenced within five years, except for certain crimes enumerated in the statute such as:  (1) bribery and official misconduct offenses which must be commenced within seven years; (2) criminal sexual contact or endangering the welfare of a minor which must be commenced within five years after the victim attains the age of 18 or two years after discovery, whichever is later. Prosecutions for disorderly persons offenses must be commenced within one year after they are committed. By eliminating the statute of limitations for human trafficking crimes, the prosecution for these crimes may be commenced at any time rather than within five years after it is committed.
