<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 12 of P.L.1995,
c.244 (C.2A:50-64) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  a.  With respect to the
sale of a mortgaged premises under foreclosure action, each sheriff in this
State shall provide for, but not be limited to, the following uniform
procedures:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  Bidding in the name of
the assignee of the foreclosing plaintiff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  That adjournment of the
sale of the foreclosed property shall be in accordance with N.J.S.2A:17-36.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  (a)  The sheriff shall conduct
a sale within 150 days of the sheriff's receipt of any writ of execution issued
by the court in any foreclosure proceeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  If it becomes apparent
that the sheriff cannot comply with the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this
paragraph (3), the foreclosing plaintiff may apply to the office for an order
appointing a Special Master to hold the foreclosure sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Upon the foreclosing
plaintiff making such application to the office, the office shall issue the
appropriate order appointing a Special Master to hold the foreclosure sale. The
office may issue the order to appoint a Special Master to hold foreclosure
sales for one or more properties within a vicinage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  That <u>the upset price
for the sale of the foreclosed upon property be no higher than 50 percent of the
sum of the outstanding mortgage and any interest, fees, or other costs
accumulated from the beginning of the foreclosure action.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(5)  Except as otherwise
provided in this paragraph with respect to the purchase of</u><b><u><sup><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'> </span></sup></u></b><u>residential
property for which there is a 84 month occupancy requirement,</u> the
successful bidder at the sheriff's sale shall pay a 20 percent deposit in
either cash or by a certified or cashier's check, made payable to the sheriff
of the county in which the sale is conducted, immediately upon the conclusion
of the foreclosure sale. <u>In the case of residential property in which the
bidder shall occupy the property as the bidders primary residence for a period
of at least 84 months, the successful bidder who has fulfilled the requirements
set forth in subsection g. of this section shall pay a 3.5 percent deposit by cash,
certified or cashiers check, or by wire transfer, made payable to the sheriff
of the county in which the sale is conducted or to the Special Master, if the
sheriff cannot comply with the provisions of subparagraph (a) of paragraph (3)
of this subsection, immediately upon the conclusion of the foreclosure sale.</u> 
If the successful bidder cannot satisfy this requirement, the bidder shall be
in default and the sheriff shall immediately void the sale and proceed further
with the resale of the premises without the necessity of adjourning the sale,
without renotification of any party to the foreclosure and without the
republication of any sales notice.  Upon such resale, the defaulting bidder
shall be liable to the foreclosing plaintiff for any additional costs incurred
by such default including, but not limited to, any difference between the
amount bid by the defaulting bidder and the amount generated for the foreclosing
plaintiff at the resale.  In the event the plaintiff is the successful bidder
at the resale, the plaintiff shall provide a credit for the fair market value
of the property foreclosed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, in the case of
residential property in which the bidder will occupy the property for at least
84 months, the bidder will have up to 90 business days to complete the sale,
with no interest accruing on the balance of the sale for 60 business days
following the sale.  If the successful bidder does not pay the balance within
this 90 business day period, the bidder would forfeit the deposit on the
property and be responsible for the payment of accrued interest and fees or
penalties incurred as a result of the sale being void, unless the failure to
fulfill the balance is due to the bidders inability to close a mortgage
through no fault of the bidders own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
sheriff require the foreclosing plaintiff to disclose whether the property is
vacant, tenant-occupied, or owner-occupied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a bidder may
purchase property in a sheriffs sale by way of financing if the bidder
provides documentation that the bidder has been pre-approved by a financial
institution for financing the property. A bidder, other than the foreclosed
upon defendant or the foreclosed upon defendants next of kin, may only use the
financing option if the property will be the bidders primary residence.  If a
successful bidder finances the property and does not use the property as a
primary residence, the bidder will be subject to a fine of up to $100,000 for
the first violation and $500,000 for each violation thereafter.  However, there
are exceptions to the penalties if the bidder must vacate the property due to
death of the bidder or the bidders spouse, disability of the bidder or the
bidders spouse, divorce, military deployment, or foreclosure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To be a successful bidder on a
residential property the bidder, who is not the plaintiff, who intends to
occupy the property and finance the purchase of the property, shall have
received eight hours of homebuyer education and counseling from the United
States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and shall present
certification of completion of that training at the time of purchase. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires each
sheriffs office to maintain information, written in plain language, regarding
the program to finance the purchase of residential property in a foreclosure
sale on its internet website in a manner that is accessible to the public.  Additionally,
each sheriffs office is to display information, written in plain language,
regarding the program in its office in a manner that is conspicuous to the
public.  The information posted on a sheriffs website or displayed in a
sheriffs office concerning the program must contain language notifying the
public that the program excludes those purchasing property for investment
purposes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For any county in which the
primary language of 10 percent or more of the residents is a language other
than English, the bill directs the sheriffs office to provide the information
required for the program in that other language or languages in addition to
English.  The alternate language would be determined based on information from
the latest federal decennial census. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With the exception of sales
conducted pursuant to the Community Wealth Preservation Program, the bill
increases the fee to be charged by virtue of an execution sale from 4 to 5
percent, or 6 percent to 10 percent, depending on whether the sum involved is
greater than or less than $5,000, respectively.  The bill also increases the
minimum fee to be charged by virtue of an execution sale from $50 to $150. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
creditors and creditors agents with immunity from liability for damages to
certain vacant and abandoned property so long as reasonable care is exercised,
and clarifies that bidders are not authorized to enter the property prior to
the time of sale.</p>
