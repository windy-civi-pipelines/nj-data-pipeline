<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  The First Responders
COVID-19 Supplemental Benefits Program is established in the Division of
Workers' Compensation in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development to
provide supplemental benefits to each eligible first responder.  The
supplemental benefits shall be provided from the Second Injury Fund for the
time in which an eligible first responder qualifies for regular compensation
awarded pursuant to R.S.34:15-12 equal to 70 percent of the weekly wages
received at the time of injury subject to minimum and maximum compensation
stated in subsection a. of R.S.34:15-12, but shall not commence until all
benefits or compensation which is equal to the responders full salary as
required or permitted by law or a collective bargaining agreement have ended. 
The period in which the supplemental benefits are provided shall continue as
long as the responder is unable to work because of illness or injury of the
worker arising from contracting COVID-19 but shall not exceed a total of 180
weeks.  The amount of the supplemental benefits provided pursuant to this
section shall be such that the sum of the weekly regular compensation plus the
weekly supplemental benefit is equal to 100 percent of the weekly wages
received a the time of the injury, except that that sum shall not exceed
$1,800.  If the eligible first responder is a volunteer who, pursuant to
R.S.34:15-75, is conclusively presumed to receive a salary sufficient to be
entitled to the maximum compensation authorized by R.S.34:15-1 et seq., the
weekly supplemental benefits shall be such that, the sum of the weekly regular
compensation and the weekly supplemental benefit shall be equal to 100 percent
of the weekly wages the responder received from paid employment at the time of
the injury, or the maximum compensation authorized by R.S.23:15-1 et seq.,
whichever is more, except that that sum shall not exceed $1,800.  The
supplemental benefits shall be provided only during the time the responder is
unable to work in any employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Supplemental benefits
shall not be provided pursuant to this section unless a claim is filed within
two years following the end of the public health emergency which was declared
by the Governor in Executive Order 106 of 2020 and extended by subsequent
executive orders.  If a claim for supplemental benefits filed within that
two-year period is approved, the benefits shall be rewarded retroactively to
the beginning of the supplemental benefit period indicated in subsection a. of
this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     This section is
intended to provide supplemental benefits to eligible first responders under
the circumstances specified in this section, and shall not be construed as
reducing, limiting or curtailing any rights of any worker or employee to any
benefits provided by R.S.34:15-1 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
First Responders COVID-19 Supplemental Benefits Program in the in the Division
of Workers' Compensation.  The bill provides supplemental benefits to first
responders determined to be eligible for workers compensation because they
have contracted COVID-19 in the course of employment.  The supplemental
benefits are provided for the time in which an eligible first responder
qualifies for regular workers compensation equal to 70 percent of the weekly
wages received at the time of injury subject to the stated minimum and maximum
compensation levels.  The supplemental benefits do not commence until all
benefits which are equal to the responders full salary have ended.  The
supplemental benefits are provided as long as the responder is unable to work
due to COVID-19 but not more than 180 weeks.  The amount of the supplemental
benefit is such that the sum of the weekly regular workers compensation plus
the weekly supplemental benefit equals 100 percent of the responders weekly
wage, except that that sum shall not exceed $1,800.  If the responder is a
volunteer paid the maximum weekly workers compensation rate, the supplemental
benefits shall also be such that the sum of the weekly regular compensation
plus the weekly supplemental benefit equals 100 percent of the responders
weekly wage up to the maximum of $1,800, except that for the volunteers the
maximum workers compensation rate shall continue to apply, even if it exceeds
100 percent of the weekly wage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development to issue annual reports of
available information regarding the number of claims by first responders
entitled to the supplemental benefits, the total amount of benefits awarded,
the total anticipated and the accrued costs of the benefits, and an estimate of
what portion of the funds appropriated for the program will be needed to pay
all of the benefits, and a request to the Governor and the Legislature for any
additional appropriation which may be required to make the payments.  The supplemental
benefits are not to be considered in determining the annual surcharge levied on
policyholders and self-insured employers for the Second Injury Fund or the
experience ratings of individual employers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes the First
Responders COVID-19 Supplemental Benefits Program Advisory Council in the
Division of Workers' Compensation to advise the division and provide
recommendations concerning the administration of the program.  The council is
comprised of the following 12 members: the Commissioners of Labor and Workforce
Development, Human Services, and Health; one representative each selected by
the New Jersey State Police Benevolent Association, Inc., the Fraternal Order
of Police, the Professional Fire Fighters Association of New Jersey, the New
Jersey State Firefighters Mutual Benevolent Association, the EMS Council of New
Jersey, and the New Jersey State Firemens Association; and three public
members appointed by the Governor with experience as first responders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The advisory council will be dissolved,
and the annual reports by both the council and the commissioner will cease,
upon a determination that that all eligible first responders have received all
supplemental benefits to which they are entitled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill appropriates from the
General Fund to the Second Injury Fund $20,000,000 for the First Responders
COVID-19 Supplemental Benefits Program, to be used for the provision of the supplemental
benefits and any necessary expenses of the advisory council.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of this
legislation is to assist first responders, whose public service has rendered
them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, by alleviating long-term economic
hardships due to COVID-19.  The support provided by the bill is especially
important in cases where first responders become unable to work for long
periods of time because of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), persistent,
long-term symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19, colloquially known
as long COVID.</p>
