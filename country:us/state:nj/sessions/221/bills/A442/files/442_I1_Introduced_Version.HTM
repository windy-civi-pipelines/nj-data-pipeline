(2)   A school district may request approval from the commissioner to calculate EP equal to 1.00 for any increase in weighted resident enrollment if it can demonstrate that the calculation pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection would result in an average class size that exceeds 10% above the facilities efficiency standards established pursuant to P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.). c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.44) d.    (1)  The allowable adjustment for increases in health care costs authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal that portion of the actual increase in total health care costs for the budget year, less any withdrawals from the current expense emergency reserve account for increases in total health care costs, that exceeds 2.0 percent of the total health care costs in the prebudget year, but that is not in excess of the product of the total health care costs in the prebudget year multiplied by the average percentage increase of the State Health Benefits Program, P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.), as annually determined by the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury. (2)   The allowable adjustment for increases in the amount of normal and accrued liability pension contributions authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal that portion of the actual increase in total normal and accrued liability pension contributions for the budget year that exceeds 2.0 percent of the total normal and accrued liability pension contributions in the prebudget year. (3)   The allowable adjustment for expenditures incurred in connection with the opening of a new school facility during the budget year authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall include costs associated with the new facility related to new teaching staff members, support staff, materials and equipment, custodial and maintenance expenditures, and such other required costs as determined by the commissioner. e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.44) f.     The adjusted tax levy shall be increased or decreased accordingly whenever the responsibility and associated cost of a school district activity is transferred to another school district or governmental entity. (cf: P.L.2010, c.44, s.4) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall first be applicable to the next school budget year following enactment. STATEMENT This bill authorizes an adjustment to the school district tax levy cap for expenditures incurred by the district in connection with the opening of a new school facility during the budget year.  The allowable adjustment will include costs associated with the new facility that are related to new teaching staff members, support staff, materials and equipment, custodial and maintenance expenditures, and other costs as may be determined by the Commissioner of Education.  It is unrealistic to expect a school district  to  accommodate  within  its base  2% tax  levy increase the new costs that will be incurred by the district in the first year that it opens a new school facility.  This bill will allow a school district to increase its tax levy in that first year of the schools operation to reflect these new facility-related expenditures.
