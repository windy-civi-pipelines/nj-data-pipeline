The court shall order the parents or legal guardian to submit the results of the mental health evaluation to the court, and if counseling is ordered subsequently, the court may order the parents or legal guardian to provide documentation of attendance to the court. h.    The Administrative Office of the Courts shall, with the assistance of the Attorney General, municipal prosecutors, and county prosecutors, maintain a record of any requirements or conditions imposed pursuant to this section or as a result of any conviction pursuant to this section, including, but not limited to mental health evaluations and documentation of mental health counseling attendance. (cf:  P.L.2017, c.331 s.10) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends current law to require a mental health evaluation for any animal cruelty offender, whether an adult or a juvenile, to be followed by mental health counseling if warranted by the evaluation.  It is designated Shyannes Law in recognition of Shyanne, a dog that died in the care of an animal behaviorist who had been previously observed abusing an animal.
