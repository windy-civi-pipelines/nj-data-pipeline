This act shall take effect immediately and shall first apply to the first full school year next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill modifies certain provisions of current law, including the Charter School Program Act of 1995, to impose various new requirements pertaining to charter school admission, enrollment, reporting, and athletics. Student Records and Student Placement Liaisons This bill directs the chief school administrator or lead person of a public school to designate a staff member to serve as a student placement liaison.  The student placement liaison is responsible for: (1) coordinating with the students school of last attendance, or a students subsequent educational placement in the case of a student exiting the public school, and the students parent or guardian to ensure the successful transition of the student; and (2) tracking and maintaining student enrollment data, including information on student transfers into or out of the public school, to ensure State school aid is provided in accordance with State law and regulation. Under the bill, a charter schools student placement liaison is also required, to the greatest extent practicable, to conduct an exit interview when a student exits the charter school for a reason other than graduation. Charter School Admissions and Enrollment Under the bill, a charter school is required to make its student application materials available in the seven most common non-English languages spoken by individuals with limited-English proficiency in the school district in which the charter school is located, based on United States Census Bureau American Community Survey data. This bill prohibits a charter school from establishing criteria to evaluate prospective students or from imposing qualifications for enrollment on a student selected through a random selection process established by the charter school to determine admission in the event more students apply than there are spaces available. The bill permits, if there is space available, a charter school to enroll students who do not reside in the district in which the charter school is located, provided the Commissioner of Education approves the enrollment of students in accordance with the provisions of the bill.  The bill requires the commissioner to develop a procedure by which a student may enroll in a charter school located outside of the school district in which the student resides.  The procedure is to require the commissioner to evaluate certain criteria related to fiscal impact, student population diversity, and educational quality. This bill prohibits a charter school from counseling or advising a student to withdraw from the charter school.  The bill provides that this provision is not to be construed as prohibiting a charter schools child study team from considering, with the full participation of a students parent or guardian, a program or placement option for a student with a disability that includes placement in another setting in accordance with federal and State law concerning students with disabilities. Charter School Reporting Under the bill, a charter school is required to annually report the number of students exiting the charter school in the preceding school year to the Commissioner of Education and each school district served by the charter school.  The report is to be based on exit reporting criteria developed by the commissioner.  The report is to include last dates of attendance, reasons for exiting the charter school, and subsequent educational placement.  The report is not to include a students personal identifying information or any other information that would violate the students privacy rights. The bill requires the commissioner to post on the Department of Educations Internet Website, information reported by a charter school under the School Report Card Program. If a charter school operates more than one school facility in the State, the information is to be posted separately for each charter school facility. Interscholastic Athletics The bill requires charter schools offering interscholastic athletics to join a voluntary association, such as the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association.  The charter school is to be governed by the rules and regulations of the association. Under the bill, the rules and regulations of the association are deemed to be the policy of the board of trustees and enforced first by the internal procedures of the association.  The bill outlines when a decision by the association is to be appealed to the commissioner or the Superior Court.  Under the bill, the rules and regulations of the voluntary association only apply to association sanctioned activities offered by the charter school. Under the bill, a non-resident student enrolled in a charter school is required to meet certain requirements in order to participate in interscholastic athletics at the charter school. The bill permits the commissioner to waive these requirements for a non-resident student whose school district of residence does not offer the interscholastic athletic activity in which the student participates.  The bill also clarifies that these new conditions are not to apply to any student enrolled in a charter school on the effective date of this bill.

STATEMENT This bill modifies certain provisions of current law, including the Charter School Program Act of 1995, to impose various new requirements pertaining to charter school admission, enrollment, reporting, and athletics. Student Records and Student Placement Liaisons This bill directs the chief school administrator or lead person of a public school to designate a staff member to serve as a student placement liaison.  The student placement liaison is responsible for: (1) coordinating with the students school of last attendance, or a students subsequent educational placement in the case of a student exiting the public school, and the students parent or guardian to ensure the successful transition of the student; and (2) tracking and maintaining student enrollment data, including information on student transfers into or out of the public school, to ensure State school aid is provided in accordance with State law and regulation. Under the bill, a charter schools student placement liaison is also required, to the greatest extent practicable, to conduct an exit interview when a student exits the charter school for a reason other than graduation. Charter School Admissions and Enrollment Under the bill, a charter school is required to make its student application materials available in the seven most common non-English languages spoken by individuals with limited-English proficiency in the school district in which the charter school is located, based on United States Census Bureau American Community Survey data. This bill prohibits a charter school from establishing criteria to evaluate prospective students or from imposing qualifications for enrollment on a student selected through a random selection process established by the charter school to determine admission in the event more students apply than there are spaces available. The bill permits, if there is space available, a charter school to enroll students who do not reside in the district in which the charter school is located, provided the Commissioner of Education approves the enrollment of students in accordance with the provisions of the bill.  The bill requires the commissioner to develop a procedure by which a student may enroll in a charter school located outside of the school district in which the student resides.  The procedure is to require the commissioner to evaluate certain criteria related to fiscal impact, student population diversity, and educational quality.

The bill requires the commissioner to post on the Department of Educations Internet Website, information reported by a charter school under the School Report Card Program. If a charter school operates more than one school facility in the State, the information is to be posted separately for each charter school facility. Interscholastic Athletics The bill requires charter schools offering interscholastic athletics to join a voluntary association, such as the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association.  The charter school is to be governed by the rules and regulations of the association. Under the bill, the rules and regulations of the association are deemed to be the policy of the board of trustees and enforced first by the internal procedures of the association.  The bill outlines when a decision by the association is to be appealed to the commissioner or the Superior Court.  Under the bill, the rules and regulations of the voluntary association only apply to association sanctioned activities offered by the charter school. Under the bill, a non-resident student enrolled in a charter school is required to meet certain requirements in order to participate in interscholastic athletics at the charter school. The bill permits the commissioner to waive these requirements for a non-resident student whose school district of residence does not offer the interscholastic athletic activity in which the student participates.  The bill also clarifies that these new conditions are not to apply to any student enrolled in a charter school on the effective date of this bill.
