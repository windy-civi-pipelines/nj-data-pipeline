<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    A constitutional
convention shall convene in New Brunswick at Rutgers, the State University, or
if a suitable facility at Rutgers is unavailable at a location selected by the
Governor, on  May 8, 2013 for the purpose of proposing amendments to the New
Jersey Constitution and changes to the statutes, which revise the system of
property taxation in this State, following approval by the voters of the
holding of such a convention and the election of delegates thereto in the
manner provided by this act.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The convention shall
recommend amendments to the New Jersey Constitution and changes to the
statutes, which, while revenue neutral in their overall impact, eliminate
inequities in the current system of property taxation, especially as those
inequities may affect low and moderate income residents of this State, ensure
greater uniformity in the application of property taxes, reduce property taxes
as a share of overall public revenue, provide alternatives which lessen the
dependence of local government on property taxes, or provide alternative means,
including possible increases in other taxes, of funding local government
services.  The convention shall also recommend means, consistent with its
mandate of establishing how revenue ought to be raised in New Jersey, to ensure
that reductions in property taxes, or limits on increases thereof, shall be
sustained over time.  As used in this act, &quot;revenue neutral&quot; means
that the aggregate amount of all revenues enacted under powers of the State, as
accurately as can be estimated and measured, shall be the same after changes
recommended by the convention as they were before such changes.  The convention
shall be limited to considering and making recommendations in regard to the
aforesaid matters and the implementation thereof.  The convention shall not
agree upon, propose or submit to the vote of the people any amendment to the
New Jersey Constitution, or any revision to the statutes, which detracts from
the obligation of the Legislature, pursuant to Article VIII, Section IV,
paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, to provide for the maintenance and
support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools or from the
obligation of any municipality to provide affordable housing pursuant to
decisions of the New Jersey Supreme Court.  The convention shall not consider
or recommend any proposal providing for a Statewide equalized school property
tax, or detracting from collective bargaining rights or dispute resolution
procedures as those rights and procedures exist on the effective date of this
act, or that fails to provide tenants of residential rental units with their
proportionate share of any property tax reduction, in a non-discriminatory
manner, for as long as the reduction lasts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    The convention shall

shall not be bracketed with any other nominee on the ballot and no designation,

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill implements many of
the recommendations of the New Jersey Property Tax Convention Task Force.  It
provides for convening a State constitutional convention for the sole purpose
of reforming, pursuant to the requirements and limitations specified by this
bill, the system of property taxation in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill places the question
of whether a convention should be convened before the voters at the general
election to be held in November 2012.  The approval by the voters at that
general election of the holding of a convention will confer upon the convention
the authority to recommend relevant changes to the State Constitution and
changes to the New Jersey statutes. The convention's recommendations for
changes to the State Constitution and changes to the New Jersey statutes would
be presented to the voters as a single package for their approval at the
general election held in November 2013; except that, if a temporary
constitutional amendment authorizing the convention to propose statutory
changes for voter approval is not placed on the ballot at the 2012 general
election, the convention may anticipate that such a constitutional amendment
may be placed on the 2013 general election ballot at the same time as the
convention's proposal and the convention, at its discretion, may structure its
proposal so that, if the constitutional amendment fails to receive voter approval,
the convention's entire proposal will also fail, or any constitutional
amendments proposed by the convention and approved by the voters, but not
statutory changes, will be adopted.  Thus, statutory changes proposed by the
convention will become effective if a separate temporary constitutional
amendment authorizing the convention to propose statutory changes for voter
approval is adopted not later than the general election at which the voters
approve the convention's proposal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that at the
annual school election in April 2013, two delegates to the convention will be
elected from each of the 40 legislative districts, for a total of 80 elected
delegates.  The names of candidates for the office of delegate on the ballot
will rotate in successive election districts in order to limit any potential
impact of ballot position on voter choice.  A nominee for election of the
office of delegate would not be bracketed with any other candidate on the
ballot and no designation, slogan or affiliation for a nominee would be printed
on the ballot.  The bill limits the amount of a contribution to a candidate for
the office of delegate from any contributor to $250 with a limit of $6,250 in
the aggregate on contributions to all candidates for the office of delegate. 
Delegates would be nominated by a petition signed by at least 100 registered
voters of the district from which the delegate seeks election.  Local elected
officials would be eligible to serve as delegates, but members of the
Legislature would be ineligible to be elected, or to serve, as delegates. 
Labor organizations and corporations would be prohibited from contributing to
the campaigns of candidates for the office of delegate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes a
voluntary limit of $25,000 on expenditures made in connection with a candidacy
for the office of delegate.   Any candidate, or any committee, group or
organization in support of that candidate, that pledges to expend, and expends,
less than that amount in connection with that candidate's candidacy may include
on its campaign materials a statement indicating that the candidate, committee,
group, or organization has complied with the voluntary campaign expenditure
limit.  Any candidate for the office of delegate, or any committee, group or
organization in support of that candidate, that expends more than $25,000 in
connection with that candidate's candidacy would be required to include on all
subsequent campaign materials a statement indicating that the candidate,
committee, group, or organization has exceeded the voluntary campaign
expenditure limit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to the 80 elected
delegates to the convention, 10 additional delegates will be appointed, two
each by the Governor, the President of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the
Senate, the Speaker of the General Assembly, and the Minority Leader of the
General Assembly.  These appointments will be made within ten days of the
certification of the results of the election for delegates.  In making the
appointments, the appointing authorities will take into consideration this
State's demographic diversity and the degree to which that diversity is
represented by the delegates elected to the convention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The convention will convene on
 May 8, 2013 and complete its work by August
 26, 2013.  The duty of the convention will be to prepare a proposal consisting
of amendments to the New Jersey Constitution and, if the voters approve a
temporary constitutional amendment authorizing the convention to propose
statutory changes, changes to existing law, which, while revenue neutral in
their overall impact, eliminate inequities in the current system of property
taxation, ensure greater uniformity in the application of property taxes,
reduce property taxes as a share of overall public revenue, provide
alternatives which lessen the dependence of local government on property taxes,
or provide alternative means, including possible increases in other taxes, of
funding local government services.  The bill expressly provides that the
convention may not propose amendments affecting the obligation of the
Legislature, under the New Jersey Constitution, to provide for the maintenance
and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools or the
obligation of any municipality to provide affordable housing pursuant to decisions
of the New Jersey Supreme Court.  In addition, the convention will not consider
or recommend any proposal providing for a Statewide equalized school property
tax, or detracting from collective bargaining rights or dispute resolution
procedures as those rights and procedures exist on the effective date of this
act, or that fails to provide tenants of residential rental units with their
proportionate share of any property tax reduction, in a non-discriminatory
manner, for as long as the reduction lasts. Any changes of the New
  Jersey statutes recommended by the convention and approved by the voters at
the general election held in November 2013 will thereafter be subject to
amendment or repeal by the Legislature and the Governor in the same manner as
other laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The convention is limited to
considering the issue of tax reform.  It may not consider any other issues. The
bill directs the Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court to appoint a
committee of three retired members of the Judiciary, no more than two of whom
shall be of the same political party, that will review proposals prepared by
the convention during the course of the convention's proceedings and advise the
convention whether such proposals are in compliance with the convention's instructions
as voted by the people and do not exceed those instructions or the convention's
limited purpose in any way.  The convention will not take a vote on its final
proposal to be placed on the ballot for voter approval unless the committee has
certified that the convention has complied with its instructions and not
exceeded those instructions or its limited purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
Legislative Services Commission to undertake certain research tasks in advance
of the convention, as well as during the convention, and to recruit qualified
employees who may be employed by the convention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill appropriates
$3,845,000 to effectuate its purposes. </p>
