CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning student growth objectives and supplementing chapter 6 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, the State Board of Education shall not require student growth objectives, or any substantially similar assessment, as part of the evaluation of any teacher. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill prohibits the State Board of Education from requiring the completion of student growth objectives as part of the evaluation of any teacher.

The student achievement component of the teacher evaluation rubric currently utilizes student growth objectives, which are multiple assessments designed by teachers to measure student progress in relation to the New Jersey Student Learning Standards. Student growth objectives account for between 15 and 50 percent of a teachers overall evaluation. Under the bill, the State Board of Education would be prohibited from requiring student growth objectives, or any substantially similar assessment, as part of the evaluation of any teacher.
