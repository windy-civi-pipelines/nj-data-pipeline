leave is foreseeable, provide the employer with written notice of the need for
the leave, unless an emergency or other unforeseen circumstances precludes
prior notice. The notice shall be provided to the employer as far in advance as

effort to schedule the use of earned sick leave in a manner that does not
unduly disrupt the operations of the employer. If the reason for the leave is
not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to give notice of the
intention as soon as practicable, if the employer has notified the employee of
this requirement.  Employers may prohibit employees from using foreseeable
earned sick leave on certain dates, and require reasonable documentation if
sick leave that is not foreseeable is used during those dates.  For earned sick
leave of three or more consecutive days, an employer may require reasonable
documentation that the leave is being taken for the purpose permitted under
subsection a. of this section. If the leave is permitted under paragraph (1) or
(2) of subsection a. of this section, documentation signed by a health care

section. An employer may provide an offer to an employee for a payment of
unused earned sick leave in the final month of the employer's benefit year. 
The employee shall choose, no later than 10 calendar days from the date of the
employer's offer, whether to accept a payment or decline a payment.  If the
employee agrees to receive a payment, the employee shall choose a payment for
the full amount of unused earned sick leave or for 50 percent of the amount of
unused earned sick leave. The payment amount shall be based on the same rate of
pay that the employee earns at the time of the payment.  If the employee
declines a payment for unused earned sick leave, or agrees to a payment for 50
percent of the amount of unused sick leave, the employee shall be entitled to
carry forward any unused or unpaid earned sick leave to the proceeding benefit
year as provided pursuant to subsection a. of section 2 of this act.  If the

then the employer shall either provide to the employee a payment for the full
amount of unused earned sick leave in the final month of the employer's benefit
year or carry forward any unused sick leave to the next benefit year.  The
employer may pay the employee the full amount of unused earned sick leave in
the final month of a benefit year pursuant to this subsection only if the
employer forgoes, with respect to that employee, the accrual process for earned
sick leave during the next benefit year.  Unless an employer policy or
collective bargaining agreement provides for the payment of accrued earned sick
leave upon termination, resignation, retirement or other separation from
employment, an employee shall not be entitled under this section to payment of
unused earned sick leave upon the separation from employment. </p>

the following academic year or term shall be in the same capacity;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (D)  The economic conditions
of the employment offered may not be considerably less in the following
academic year or term than in the then current academic year or term.  For the
purpose of this paragraph, &quot;considerably less&quot; means that the
claimant will earn less than 90 percent of the amount the claimant earned in
the then current academic year or term;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (E)  The offer of employment
in the following academic year or term is not contingent upon a factor or
factors that are within the educational institution's control, including but
not limited to, course programming, decisions on how to allocate available
funding, final course offerings, program changes, and facility availability;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (F)   Based on a totality of
the circumstances, it is highly probable that there is a job available for the
claimant in the following academic year or term.  If a job offer contains a
contingency, primary weight should be given to the contingent nature of the
offer of employment. Contingencies that are not necessarily within the
educational institution's control, such as funding, enrollment and seniority,
may be taken into consideration but the existence of any one contingency should
not determine whether it is highly probable that there is a job available for
the claimant in the following academic year or term. </p>

department whether claimants have a &quot;reasonable assurance&quot; shall be
done on a case-by-case basis. </p>

the educational institution maintains does have a reasonable assurance of
employment in the following academic year or term, a statement explaining the
manner in which the employee was given a reasonable assurance of employment,
that is, whether it was in writing, oral, or implied, and what information
about the offer, including contingencies, was communicated to the individual.</p>

under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (7) of this subsection (g) may be used by

educational institution to provide the statement required under subparagraph
(B) of paragraph (7) of this subsection (g) not less than 10 business days
prior to the end of the academic year or term shall result in a rebuttable
presumption that the claimant does not have a reasonable assurance of
employment in the following academic year or term.  This rebuttable presumption
shall give rise to an inference that the claimant does not have a reasonable
assurance of employment in the following academic year or term, but shall not
conclusively demonstrate that the claimant does not have a reasonable assurance
of employment in the following academic year or term. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    This act shall be
liberally construed as remedial legislation enacted upon the following declarations
of public policy and legislative findings of fact:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The public policy of this
State, already established, is to protect employees against the suffering and
hardship generally caused by involuntary unemployment.  But the
&quot;unemployment compensation law&quot; provides benefit payments to replace
wage loss caused by involuntary unemployment only so long as an individual is
&quot;able to work, and is available for work,&quot; and fails to provide any
protection against wage loss suffered because of inability to perform the
duties of a job interrupted by non-occupational illness, injury, or other
disability of the individual or of members of the individual's family.  Nor is
there any other comprehensive and systematic provision for the protection of
working people against loss of earnings due to a non-occupational sickness,
accident, or other disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The prevalence and incidence
of non-occupational sickness, accident, and other disability among employed
people is greatest among the lower income groups, who either cannot or will not
voluntarily provide out of their own resources against the hazard of an
earnings loss caused by non-occupational sickness, accident, or other
disability.  Disabling sickness or accident occurs throughout the working
population at one time or another, and approximately fifteen per centum (15%)
of the number of people at work may be expected to suffer disabling illness of
more than one week each year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It was found, prior to the
enactment of the &quot;Temporary Disability Benefits Law,&quot; P.L.1948, c.110
(C.43:21-25 et al.), that then existing voluntary plans for the payment of cash
sickness benefits covered less than one-half of the number of working people of
this State who were covered by the &quot;unemployment compensation law,&quot;
and that even that degree of voluntary protection afforded uneven, unequal and
sometimes uncertain protection among the various voluntary benefit programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     While the enactment of that
law has provided stable protection for New Jersey's disabled workers, very few
workers are protected from income losses caused by the need to take time off
from work to care for family members who are incapable of self-care, including
newborn and newly-adopted children.  The growing portion of middle-income
families in which all adult family members work, largely due to economic
necessity, points to the desperate need for replacement income when a working
family member must take time to care for family members who are unable to take
care of themselves.  Moreover, the United States is the only industrialized
nation in the world which does not have a mandatory workplace-based program for
such income support.  It is therefore desirable and necessary to fill the gap
in existing provisions for protection against the loss of earnings caused by
involuntary unemployment, by extending such protection to meet the hazard of
earnings loss due to inability to work caused by non-occupational sickness,
accidents, or other disabilities of workers and members of their families. 
Developing systems that help families adapt to the competing interests of work
and home not only benefits workers, but also benefits employers by reducing
employee turnover and increasing worker productivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The foregoing facts and
considerations require that there be a uniform minimum program providing in a
systematic manner for the payment of reasonable benefits to replace partially
such earnings loss and to meet the continuing need for benefits where an
individual becomes disabled during unemployment or needs to care for family
members incapable of self-care.  In order to maintain consumer purchasing
power, relieve the serious menace to health, morals and welfare of the people
caused by insecurity and the loss of earnings, to reduce the necessity for
public relief of needy persons, to increase workplace productivity and
alleviate the enormous and growing stress on working families of balancing the
demands of work and family needs, and in the interest of the health, welfare
and security of the people of this State, such a system, enacted under the
police power, is hereby established, requiring the payment of reasonable cash
benefits to eligible individuals who are subject to accident or illness which
is not compensable under the worker's compensation law or who need to care for
family members incapable of self-care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>While the Legislature recognizes
the pressing need for benefits for workers taking leave to care for family
members incapable of self-care, it also finds that the need of workers for
leave during their own disability continues to be especially acute, as a
disabled worker has less discretion about taking time off from work than a
worker caring for a family member.  Notwithstanding any interpretation of law
which may be construed as providing a worker with rights to take action against
an employer who fails or refuses to restore the worker to employment after the
worker's own disability, the Legislature does not intend that the policy
established by P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) of providing benefits for
workers during periods of family temporary disability leave to care for family
members incapable of self-care be construed as granting any worker an
entitlement to be restored by the employer to employment held by the worker
prior to taking family temporary disability leave or any right to take action,
in tort, or for breach of an implied provision of the employment agreement, or
under common law, against an employer who fails or refuses to restore the
worker to employment after the family temporary disability leave, and the Legislature
does not intend that the policy of providing benefits during family temporary
disability leave be construed as increasing, reducing or otherwise modifying
any entitlement of a worker to return to employment or right of the worker to
take action under the provisions of the &quot;Family Leave Act,&quot; P.L.1989,
c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.).<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Since the enactment of the
&quot;Temporary Disability Benefits Law,&quot; P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et
al.), the State government-operated State temporary disability benefits plan, or
&quot;State plan,&quot; has proven to be highly efficient and cost effective in
providing temporary disability benefits to New Jersey workers.  The State plan
guarantees the availability of coverage for all employers, regardless of
experience, with low overhead costs and a rapid processing of claims and
appeals by knowledgeable, impartial public employees. Consequently, the
percentage of all employers using the State plan increased from 64% in 1952 to
98% in 2006, while the percentage of employees covered by the State plan
increased from 28% to 83%. A publicly-operated, nonprofit State plan is
therefore indispensable to achieving the goals of the &quot;Temporary
Disability Benefits Law,&quot; P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.)</p>

in a temporary disability benefits program pursuant to the &quot;Temporary
Disability Benefits Law,&quot; P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et seq.), and

the ninth day after the individual notifies the employer of an anticipated
period of disability pursuant to paragraph (3) of this section, whichever comes

to the division a notice and claim for disability benefits under the State plan

portion of the disability leave pursuant to the &quot;Temporary Disability
Benefits Law,&quot; P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et seq.), the division may
issue benefit payments for periods not exceeding three weeks pending the
receipt of medical proof.  When requested by the division, such notice and
proof shall include certification of total disability by the attending physician,
or a record of hospital confinement. Failure to furnish notice and proof within
the time or in the manner above provided shall not invalidate or reduce any
claim if it shall be shown to the satisfaction of the division not to have been

proof was furnished as soon as reasonably possible.</p>

employer of the anticipated period of disability and submit to the division a
claim for benefits for that period, which shall include a statement of when the
period will commence and any certification requested by the division pursuant
to this section, prior to, but not more than 60 days prior to, the date on
which the period will commence.  The division shall process that claim
immediately and, upon a finding that the claim is valid, shall pay the benefit
upon the commencement of the period, except that if the division receives the
claim less than 30 days before the commencement of the period, the division
shall make the payment not more than 30 days after the receipt of the claim. 
The periods of disability leave to which the provisions of this paragraph apply
shall include, but not be limited to, any of the following if the commencement
date of the leave is known in advance:  disability related to pregnancy or
childbirth; disability related to scheduled medical procedures, treatments, or
appointments for the individual; and disability related to scheduled ongoing
care of the individual.  If an individual did not establish enough base weeks
or have enough total earnings during the base year preceding the week the
individual submits the claim for benefits, the division shall notify the
individual that the individual may file the claim again upon or after the
commencement of the period of disability and the division shall then reconsider
the individual's eligibility for benefits based on the base year preceding the
week in which the period of disability commences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   A person claiming
benefits under the State plan or for disability during unemployment shall, when

such examinations by physicians, dentists, podiatrists, chiropractors,
certified nurse midwives<u>, certified midwives, certified professional midwives,</u>
or nurses designated by the division shall be without cost to the claimant and
shall be held at a reasonable time and place.  Refusal to submit to such a
