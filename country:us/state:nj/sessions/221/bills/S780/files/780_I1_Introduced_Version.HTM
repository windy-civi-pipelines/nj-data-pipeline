STATEMENT This bill makes a number of changes to broaden eligibility for the Primary Care Practitioner Loan Redemption Program established within the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA) under N.J.S.18A:71C-32 et seq.  The bill appropriates $10 million to HESAA for the program and makes numerous technical changes. The bill: · renames the program as the Health Care Professional Loan Redemption Program; · provides for the participation in the program of psychiatrists and other health professionals working in fields designated by the Commissioner of Health for inclusion in the program; · permits the Commissioner of Health, after consultation with the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, to designate additional health care fields experiencing critical Statewide labor shortages for inclusion in the program; and · removes the requirement that a participant be employed at an approved site but provides that a minimum of 40 percent of available funds in a program year be reserved for participants employed at approved sites. The existing law that dedicates 25 percent of the funds annually appropriated for the Health Care Professional Loan Redemption Program to the Nursing Faculty Loan Redemption Program is maintained. The sponsor notes that, according to Rutgers Today, New Jersey is one of a dozen states projected to have the biggest need of primary care physicians.  The Health Resources and Services Administration projects that New Jersey will have a shortage of primary care physicians by 2025 of 1,000 or more physicians, due to both the aging American population and the number of doctors nearing retirement. As the baby boom generation reaches retirement age, the percentage of the healthcare workforce aged 65 and over is projected to reach 20% by 2034. As our population grows older, the shortage of qualified individuals to care for this vulnerable population will only be exacerbated. The shortage is not limited to just primary care physicians, as the American Association of Medical Colleges projects dire shortages by 2033 in surgical, medical, and other specialties like pathology and radiology.  The sponsor also notes that the shortage of psychiatrists has been exacerbated by the pandemic.  Those seeking help in New Jersey are experiencing long waits to meet with a psychiatrist, if they can get in at all. This bill seeks to improve New Jerseyans access to vital medical care by encouraging health care professionals to practice in the State.

STATEMENT This bill makes a number of changes to broaden eligibility for the Primary Care Practitioner Loan Redemption Program established within the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA) under N.J.S.18A:71C-32 et seq.  The bill appropriates $10 million to HESAA for the program and makes numerous technical changes. The bill: · renames the program as the Health Care Professional Loan Redemption Program; · provides for the participation in the program of psychiatrists and other health professionals working in fields designated by the Commissioner of Health for inclusion in the program; · permits the Commissioner of Health, after consultation with the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, to designate additional health care fields experiencing critical Statewide labor shortages for inclusion in the program; and · removes the requirement that a participant be employed at an approved site but provides that a minimum of 40 percent of available funds in a program year be reserved for participants employed at approved sites. The existing law that dedicates 25 percent of the funds annually appropriated for the Health Care Professional Loan Redemption Program to the Nursing Faculty Loan Redemption Program is maintained. The sponsor notes that, according to Rutgers Today, New Jersey is one of a dozen states projected to have the biggest need of primary care physicians.  The Health Resources and Services Administration projects that New Jersey will have a shortage of primary care physicians by 2025 of 1,000 or more physicians, due to both the aging American population and the number of doctors nearing retirement. As the baby boom generation reaches retirement age, the percentage of the healthcare workforce aged 65 and over is projected to reach 20% by 2034. As our population grows older, the shortage of qualified individuals to care for this vulnerable population will only be exacerbated. The shortage is not limited to just primary care physicians, as the American Association of Medical Colleges projects dire shortages by 2033 in surgical, medical, and other specialties like pathology and radiology.  The sponsor also notes that the shortage of psychiatrists has been exacerbated by the pandemic.  Those seeking help in New Jersey are experiencing long waits to meet with a psychiatrist, if they can get in at all. This bill seeks to improve New Jerseyans access to vital medical care by encouraging health care professionals to practice in the State.
