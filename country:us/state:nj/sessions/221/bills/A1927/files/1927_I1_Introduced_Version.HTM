<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. a. Notwithstanding the
provisions of N.J.S.18A:24-10 or any other law, rule, or regulation to the
contrary, the board of education of a Type II school district without a board
of school estimate may issue bonds without the approval of the voters of the
district in order to finance costs related to repairs to school facilities and
other furnishings and equipment that were damaged due to a natural disaster,
provided that the repairs are deemed to be necessary in order to provide a
thorough and efficient system of education in the school district.  In the case
of a school district without a board of school estimate that is under full
State intervention or partial State intervention in which the governance
component of school district effectiveness has not been returned to the
district, notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.1991, c.139 (C.18A:7A-46.1 et
seq.) or any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, such bonds may be
issued without the approval of the capital project control board.  The
provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any Type II school
district without a board of school estimate that is an SDA district, as that
term is defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this section,
school facility means and includes any structure, building, or facility used
wholly or in part for educational purposes by a school district and facilities
that physically support such structures, buildings, and facilities, such as
district wastewater treatment facilities, power generating facilities, and
steam generating facilities, but shall exclude other facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) The issuance of bonds
pursuant to this section shall be approved by the board of education of the
school district, or the State district superintendent in the case of a school
district under full State intervention or partial State intervention in which
the governance component of school district effectiveness has not been returned
to the district.  The approval shall be evidenced by the adoption of a
resolution by the board of education in a public meeting upon an affirmative
vote of two-thirds of its full membership.  If the school district is under
full or partial State intervention and the governance component of school
district effectiveness has not been returned to the district, the approval
shall be evidenced by a certification, affidavit, or other sworn statement
signed by the State district superintendent supporting the issuance.  The
resolution or certification, affidavit, or other sworn statement as applicable
shall, at a minimum:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) certify support for the
issuance of the bonds and authorize the submission of an application to the
Commissioner of Education pursuant to subsection c. of this section;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) petition the commissioner
to authorize the issuance of bonds pursuant to this section;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c) include the total
estimated cost of the damage to school facilities and other furnishings and
equipment, caused by a natural disaster;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d) state the project or
projects to be submitted to the commissioner and the amounts to be raised for
the project or projects;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e) the amount necessary to be
raised by school bonds for repairs to the damage to school facilities and other
furnishings and equipment; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f) the amount of funds, if
any, that the school district has been or will be reimbursed by an applicable
disaster relief agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) (a) In the event that the
repairs for which bonds are to be issued pursuant to this section are deemed to
be a school facilities project that is eligible for State debt service aid
pursuant to P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.), the board of education or State
superintendent as applicable shall apply to the commissioner seeking approval
for the school facilities project prior to the adoption of a resolution or the
signing of a certification, affidavit, or other sworn statement pursuant to
paragraph (1) of this subsection.  The application shall be reviewed by the
commissioner on an expedited basis pursuant to a process to be established by
the commissioner.  The application shall include items to be required by the
commissioner including, but not limited to: a description of the school facilities
project; a schematic drawing of the project or, at the option of the district,
preliminary plans and specifications; a delineation and description of each of
the functional components of the project; educational specifications detailing
the programmatic needs of each proposed space; the number of unhoused students
to be housed in the project; the area allowances per FTE student as calculated
pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-8); and the estimated cost to
complete the project as determined by the district.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of section 4 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-4) or section 5 of
P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-5) or the provisions of any other law, rule, or
regulation to the contrary, the approval or disapproval of an application for a
school facilities project pursuant to this section shall not be contingent upon
the school facilities project being consistent or inconsistent with the school
districts long-range facilities plan required pursuant to section 4 of
P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-4) or upon the fact that the long-range facilities
plan has not been amended to incorporate the school facilities project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) Upon approval of an
application submitted pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, the
applicant board of education shall adopt a resolution approving the issuance of
bonds in a public meeting upon an affirmative vote of two-thirds of its full
membership.  If the school district is under full or partial State intervention
and the governance component of school district effectiveness has not been
returned to the district, the approval shall be evidenced by a certification,
affidavit, or other sworn statement signed by the State district superintendent
supporting the issuance.  The resolution or certification, affidavit, or other
sworn statement as applicable shall include, in addition to the information
required pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i) the amount needed to be
raised by school bonds;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii) the final eligible costs
of the school facilities project as approved by the commissioner;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii) the total costs;</p>

district without a board of school estimate.  In the event that a school
district exceeds the applicable bond limitations after issuance of a bond
pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall,<u> </u>along with the
approval of an application provided under subsection c. of this section,
endorse the commissioners consent and shall record in writing that the
borrowing is necessary for the school district to provide a thorough and
efficient system of education and to meet an emergency caused by a natural

boards of school estimate, excluding those districts that are classified as SDA
districts, to issue bonds to finance costs relating to repairs to school
facilities and other furnishings and equipment that were damaged due to a
natural disaster. Under the bill, the bonds may be issued without the approval
of the voters of the district of a Type II school district without a board of
school estimate. The bill requires that a district may only issue bonds if the
repairs are deemed to be necessary in order to provide a thorough and efficient
system of education.</span></p>

approval would be evidenced by the adoption of a resolution by the board of education
in a public meeting upon an affirmative vote of two-thirds of its full
membership certifying the support of the board for the issuance of the bonds,
the total estimated cost of the damage caused by a natural disaster, and the
amount of money to be raised through the issuance of bonds.</span></p>

State debt service aid pursuant to the Educational Facilities and Construction
Financing Act, the board of education is required to apply to the Commissioner
of Education prior to the adoption of a resolution certifying the support for
the issuance of bonds. The application will be reviewed by the commissioner on
an expedited basis pursuant to a process to be established by the commissioner.
The bill provides that the approval or disapproval of an application for a
school facilities project would not be contingent upon the school facilities
project being consistent or inconsistent with the school districts long-range
facilities plan or upon the fact that the long-range facilities plan has not
been amended to incorporate the school facilities project. Upon approval of an
application submitted for a district seeking State debt service aid, the board
of education would adopt a resolution approving the issuance of bonds.</span></p>

even if the principal amount of the bond, when added to the net school debt of
the district, exceeds certain school debt limitations enumerated under current
law. In this case, the commissioner, upon approval of an application to borrow
