STATEMENT This bill removes the requirement that the owner of a veteran or disabled veteran-owned business must be a New Jersey resident for the business to qualify as a veteran or disabled veteran-owned business.  The change only applies to small and medium-sized businesses, as determined by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. Under current law, to qualify and be certified as a veteran-owned or disabled veteran-owned business, 51 percent of the business, among other requirements, must be owned and controlled by persons who are a New Jersey resident and a veteran or disabled veteran.  By removing the residency requirement, this will permit small and medium-sized veteran and disabled veteran-owned business owners residing in other states but with a business physically located in New Jersey to compete for New Jersey contracts.  This will increase veteran and disabled veteran business opportunities in general and in particular within the State.
