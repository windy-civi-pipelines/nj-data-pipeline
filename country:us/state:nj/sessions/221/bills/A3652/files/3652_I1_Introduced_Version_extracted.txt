Fund."  The fund shall be maintained in a separate account and administered by the board established pursuant to section 2 of this act. The monies in the fund shall be used to provide S.E.E.D. grants. b.    The fund shall consist of all moneys appropriated by the State for the purposes of the fund and all interest and investment earnings received on moneys in the fund. 5.    In each of the first three years of the S.E.E.D. Program, the State shall appropriate to the S.E.E.D.

In the event that the funds available for an institution of higher education are not awarded as S.E.E.D. grants in any of the first three years of the program, the board may either allocate those funds to the institution in a subsequent year or reallocate those funds to other institutions of higher education. In each subsequent year, the State appropriations to the S.E.E.D. Fund for each institution shall be determined with consideration of the outcomes of the projects of the prior years grantees.  In the event that an independent institution of higher education opts to participate in the program, a State appropriation shall be made to the fund in accordance with the guidelines established herein. 6.    The board shall submit a report to the Governor, and to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), four years after the establishment of the S.E.E.D. Program.  The report shall include, but need not be limited to, information on the number of applicants, the number of awards, and a description of the proposals for and outcomes of each grant awarded. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes a Supporting Educational and Entrepreneurial Development (S.E.E.D.) Program in the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education.  The purpose of the S.E.E.D.

The bill creates a special fund in the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education entitled the "S.E.E.D. Fund," consisting of all moneys appropriated by the State for the purposes of the program and all interest and investment earnings received on moneys in the fund. The fund will be used to provide S.E.E.D. grants.  The bill provides that in each of the first three years of the S.E.E.D.  Program, the State must appropriate to the S.E.E.D.  Fund for each public institution of higher education an amount equal to $2,500 per each 500 full-time student cohort and $2,500 per each 1,000 part-time student cohort.  In the event that the funds available to an institution are not awarded as S.E.E.D. grants in any of the first three years of the program, the board may either allocate those funds to the institution in subsequent years or reallocate those funds to other institutions of higher education. Under the bill, in each subsequent year, the State appropriations to the S.E.E.D.  Fund for each institution will be determined with consideration of the outcomes of the projects of prior years grantees.
