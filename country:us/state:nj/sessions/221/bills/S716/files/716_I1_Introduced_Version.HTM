<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span>
establishing an employer-based child care assistance partnership program and
supplementing Title 30 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  The Legislature finds and
declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  One of the primary
barriers for parents seeking to enter the workforce is lack of access to
affordable child care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  According to McKinseys
American Opportunity Survey, an online survey which was released in May of
2021, only 39 percent of respondents who had incomes below $50,000 and children
at home said they could afford child care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Although the lack of
affordable child care was a barrier for many working parents long before the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting public health emergency, the
pandemic required these parents to juggle jobs and caregiving responsibilities
when child care centers closed or pandemic-related restrictions limited the
number of children the centers were allowed to serve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  A 2020 survey conducted by
Care@Work of 1,000 working parents with children under the age of 15 showed
that 73 percent were considering making major changes at work, such as revising
their schedules (44 percent), looking for a different job (21 percent), or
leaving the workforce entirely (15 percent), so the parents could focus on providing
child care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  Working women are most
adversely affected by the lack of accessible child care.  Although women make
up less than half of the nations workforce, they accounted for a majority of
the decrease in the labor force during the first year of the pandemic.  Data
gathered by the Pew Research Center showed that between February 2020 and
February 2021, 2.4 million women left the workforce, compared with 1.8 million
men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  Businesses have a vested
interest in ensuring that their employees can access and afford child care. 
When companies offer child care benefits, they see increased employee retention
and loyalty, improved productivity, and a better workplace environment.  Despite
the clear advantages, in 2020, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
indicated just 11 percent of all workers had access to employer-provided child
care, and those with lower incomes were less likely to receive child care
benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  Offering benefits such as
the subsidization of child care for a companys employees or the establishment
of employer-provided spending accounts designed to cover the cost, in part or
in full, of child care-related expenses, can remove a major barrier to
workforce participation and help attract and retain employees with children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  Therefore, it is in the
best interest of the State to establish an employer-based child care assistance
partnership program that incentivizes employers to contribute to an employees
child care costs, encourages the State to provide matching funds against such
contributions to make child care more affordable for working parents, and
ensures that the children of this State have access to high-quality child care
services.</p>

Children and Families (DCF).  The purpose of the program is to incentivize
employers to contribute to employee child care costs by providing State funds
that match employer contributions in order to ensure that the working parents of
this State and their children have access to affordable, high-quality child
care services.  Participation in the program will be voluntary, and the DCF is
to regulate and oversee the activities associated with the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, an employer
who wishes to provide child care assistance to an employee under the program and
a child care provider seeking to participate in the program will submit a
one-time application to the DCF, which will enroll the employer or child care
provider in the program.  Upon enrollment, the employer may enroll employees by
submitting a standardized certification form to the DCF that includes, among
other things, the amount of the employers contribution to the employees child
care provider.  The amount of State matching funds will be based on the
employees household income.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the total amount of the
employer contribution and State matching funds do not cover the employees
total child care costs, the employee will be responsible for the remaining
balance of the costs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill sets forth certain
circumstances under which participation in the program will be terminated,
including the failure by the employer to make a contribution payment, the
failure of the employee to pay the balance of child care costs not covered
under the program, a child care provider ceasing to qualify for the program, or
voluntary termination by the employer or employee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill creates in the
Department of the Treasury a dedicated,  non-lapsing fund, to be known as the Employer-Based
Child Care Assistance Partnership Fund.  The fund will be the repository for
monies made available to implement the provisions of the bill.  All monies
expended for the purpose of providing State matching funds against contributions
made by employers to employee child care costs are to be paid from the fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the DCF
to issue a report about the programs efficacy within one year after the program
is established, and annually thereafter, to the Governor and Legislature.  The
report is to be posted on the DCFs website and made available to the public
upon request.</p>
