Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, where it shall appear that the information requested or to be examined will jeopardize the safety of any person or jeopardize any investigation in progress or may be otherwise inappropriate to release, such information may be withheld.  This exception shall be narrowly construed to prevent disclosure of information that would be harmful to a bona fide law enforcement purpose or the public safety.  Whenever a law enforcement official determines that it is necessary to withhold information, the official shall issue a brief statement explaining the decision. (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.5) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would prohibit the release of any personal identifying information of violent crime victims and witnesses under P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), commonly known as the Open Public Records Act. Current law specifically provides that the name, address, and age of any victims of crime are public record.  This bill would delete that provision and clarify that all manner of personal identifying information of violent crime victims and witnesses are confidential for purposes of public records requests to bolster the safety and privacy of violent crime victims and witnesses.

(cf: P.L.2023, c.113, s.1) 2.    Section 3 of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-3) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a. Notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, where it shall appear that the record or records which are sought to be inspected, copied, or examined shall pertain to an investigation in progress by any public agency, the right of access provided for in P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented may be denied if the inspection, copying or examination of such record or records shall be inimical to the public interest; provided, however, that this provision shall not be construed to allow any public agency to prohibit access to a record of that agency that was open for public inspection, examination, or copying before the investigation commenced.  Whenever a public agency, during the course of an investigation, obtains from another public agency a government record that was open for public inspection, examination or copying before the investigation commenced, the investigating agency shall provide the other agency with sufficient access to the record to allow the other agency to comply with requests made pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.). b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), as amended and supplemented, the following information concerning a criminal investigation shall be available to the public within 24 hours or as soon as practicable, of a request for such information: where a crime has been reported but no arrest yet made, information as to the type of crime, time, location and type of weapon, if any; if an arrest has been made, information as to the name, address and age of any victims unless [there has not been sufficient opportunity for notification of next of kin of any victims of injury and/or death to any such victim] the crime was a violent crime or [where] the release of the names of any victim would be contrary to existing law or court rule.  In deciding on the release of information as to the identity of a victim, the safety of the victim and the victim's family, and the integrity of any ongoing investigation, shall be considered; if an arrest has been made, information as to the defendant's name, age, residence, occupation, marital status and similar background information and, the identity of the complaining party unless the release of such information is contrary to existing law or court rule; information as to the text of any charges such as the complaint, accusation and indictment unless sealed by the court or unless the release of such information is contrary to existing law or court rule; information as to the identity of the investigating and arresting personnel and agency and the length of the investigation; information of the circumstances immediately surrounding the arrest, including but not limited to the time and place of the arrest, resistance, if any, pursuit, possession and nature and use of weapons and ammunition by the suspect and by the police; and information as to circumstances surrounding bail, whether it was posted and the amount thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, where it shall appear that the information requested or to be examined will jeopardize the safety of any person or jeopardize any investigation in progress or may be otherwise inappropriate to release, such information may be withheld.  This exception shall be narrowly construed to prevent disclosure of information that would be harmful to a bona fide law enforcement purpose or the public safety.  Whenever a law enforcement official determines that it is necessary to withhold information, the official shall issue a brief statement explaining the decision. (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.5) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would prohibit the release of any personal identifying information of violent crime victims and witnesses under P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), commonly known as the Open Public Records Act. Current law specifically provides that the name, address, and age of any victims of crime are public record.  This bill would delete that provision and clarify that all manner of personal identifying information of violent crime victims and witnesses are confidential for purposes of public records requests to bolster the safety and privacy of violent crime victims and witnesses.
