<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      A manufacturer rebate is an amount paid by the
manufacturer to the customer for buying a product.  Typically, a customer pays the
full price to a retailer and uses some proof of purchase to obtain a rebate
from the manufacturer. Although the later rebate payment reduces the customers
total outlay for the product, the rebate does not reduce the actual payment
that the customer made to the retailer, so a rebate does not reduce the amount
of the actual sales price or the amount of sales tax due on a sale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      This can become very confusing for the customer in
certain motor vehicle purchases involving manufacturers rebates in which the
car dealer allows the customer to apply the rebate to the purchase at the time
of the sale.  In these sales the customer turns over the rights to the rebate
to the dealer (who later collects it). Because the application of the rebate
reduces the amount of the customers outlay to the dealer, it appears to the
customer that the customer has been provided a discount on the dealers sale
price, and expects to pay sales tax on the discounted
price.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under current law the customer and the manufacturer
have together paid the full sale price, and the customer owes sales tax&nbsp;on
that full price: the customers outlay <i>plus </i>the rebate amount.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides a special
rule for manufacturer rebates in motor vehicle sales.   Under the bill, if the
rebate is a cash payment granted as a true manufacturer rebate (and not a
credit acquired under a credit or financing plan) and the rebate is used at the
time of the retail sale to reduce the sale price of the motor vehicle (and not
provided later), then the amount of the rebate is not counted as part of the
sales price on which sales tax liability is calculated.  </p>
