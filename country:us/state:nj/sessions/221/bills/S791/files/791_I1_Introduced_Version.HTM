read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     33:1-12.  Class C licenses shall
be subdivided and classified as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Plenary retail consumption
license.  1.  The holder of this license shall be entitled, subject to rules
and regulations, to sell any alcoholic beverages for consumption on the
licensed premises by the glass or other open receptacle, and also to sell any
alcoholic beverages in original containers for consumption off the licensed
premises; but this license shall not be issued to permit the sale of alcoholic
beverages in or upon any premises in which a grocery, delicatessen, drug store
or other mercantile business is carried on, except as hereinafter provided. 
The holder of this license shall be permitted to conduct consumer wine, beer
and spirits tasting events and samplings for a fee or on a complimentary basis pursuant
to conditions established by rules and regulations of the Division of Alcoholic
Beverage Control, provided however, that the holder of this license complies
with the terms and conditions set forth in section 3 of P.L.2009, c.216
(C.33:1-12d).  Subject to such rules and regulations established from time to
time by the director, the holder of this license shall be permitted to sell
alcoholic beverages in or upon the premises in which any of the following is
carried on:  the keeping of a hotel or restaurant including the sale of
mercantile items incidental thereto as an accommodation to patrons; the sale,
at an entertainment facility as defined in R.S.33:1-1, having a seating
capacity for no less than 4,000 patrons, of mercantile items traditionally associated

suitable objects as gift items to be sold only as a unit; the sale of novelty
wearing apparel identified with the name of the establishment licensed under
the provisions of this section; the sale of cigars, cigarettes, packaged
crackers, chips, nuts and similar snacks and ice at retail as an accommodation
to patrons, or the retail sale of nonalcoholic beverages as accessory beverages
to alcoholic beverages; or, in commercial bowling establishments, the retail
sale or rental of bowling accessories and the retail sale from vending machines
of candy, ice cream and nonalcoholic beverages.  The fee for this license shall
be fixed by the governing board or body of the municipality in which the
licensed premises are situated, by ordinance, at not less than $250 and not
more than $2,500.  No ordinance shall be enacted which shall raise or lower the
fee to be charged for this license by more than <b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>20%<b><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The holder of this license
shall be permitted to obtain a restricted brewery license issued pursuant to
subsection 1c. of R.S.33:1-10 and to operate a restricted brewery immediately

in that subsection.  All fees related to the issuance of both licenses shall be
paid in accordance with statutory law.</p>

alcoholic beverages in original containers for consumption off the licensed
premises, during the summer season from May 1 until November 14, inclusive, or
during the winter season from November 15 until April 30, inclusive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In addition, the
director shall issue to the holder of this license, upon request by the licensee,
one-day permits that shall entitle the license holder to sell alcoholic
beverages for consumption on the licensed premises during the season when the
license holder is not authorized to sell alcoholic beverages pursuant to
subparagraph (1) of this subsection.  The number of one-day permits issued to a
licensee pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed an aggregate of 14
permits in one calendar year.  A one-day permit issued pursuant to this
subsection shall be valid for 24 consecutive hours.  The fee for each one-day
permit shall be $500. </p>

assumed by the holder of this license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   This license shall not
be issued to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages in or upon any premises in
which a grocery, delicatessen, drug store or other mercantile business is
