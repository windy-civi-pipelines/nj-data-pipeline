[(l)] l.  Whenever a law enforcement officer detects a motor vehicle with a lamp not in working order, the driver may be permitted to park the vehicle temporarily at some safe place nearby and make the necessary repairs or replacement to restore the lamp to working order before moving the vehicle, in which event, there is no violation of this Title. [(m)] m.  Every motorbus manufactured before January 1, 1960, that has been inspected and approved as to construction and safety devices by the Board of Public Utility Commissioners shall be deemed in compliance with the requirements of this section.

STATEMENT This bill requires all passenger vehicles registered in New Jersey, including noncommercial trucks, to undergo a safety inspection of certain equipment and credentials to ensure the safe operation of the vehicle. Under current law, passenger vehicles are only required to be inspected for emissions and emission-related items such as emission control equipment and on-board diagnostics.  This bill provides that these vehicles would also be required to successfully pass a safety inspection. Specially, the safety inspections would include an evaluation for the presence and function of the following equipment within the motor vehicle:  a horn, stop lamps, headlamps, tail lamps, turning signals, a windshield and windshield wipers, rear view mirrors, tires, and seatbelts.  In addition to inspecting this equipment, the safety inspection would also include the confirmation of the following credentials for the owner or operator of the motor vehicle: a valid drivers license, a valid vehicle registration, and an active vehicle insurance policy.  The bill also allows the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission to add such additional requirements to the safety inspection as it deems appropriation. Additionally, this bill amends a section of law to clarify that all head lamps, stop lamps, and turn signals equipped on a vehicle are required to be operational.
