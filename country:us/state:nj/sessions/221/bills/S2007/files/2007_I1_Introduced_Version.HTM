the application, an employer shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   agree to allow the
Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to share the employers

certificate to an employer by March 31.  Each certificate shall include, but
not be limited to, the name and employer identification number of the certified
employer, the amount of credit that the certified employer may claim, and any
other information the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of
the Treasury determines is necessary.</p>

required pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection d., a certified employer
shall be entitled to a tax credit in an amount equal to the product of $1 and
the number of hours worked by each eligible individual for the certified
employer in this State during that eligible individual's period of employment. 
The credit shall not be allowed unless the eligible individual has worked in
the State for a minimum of 500 hours for the certified employer, and the credit
shall not exceed $2,000 per eligible individual employed by the certified
employer in the State.  </p>

amount of credit that any employer may claim, the director shall review all
applications submitted for credit by employers and, to the extent that the
total amount claimed by employers exceeds the amount allocated for the program
in that calendar year, shall issue credits on a pro rata basis corresponding to
each employer's share of the total claimed amount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
Recovery Tax Credit Program (program) to incentivize the hiring and continued
employment of certain individuals in recovery from a substance use disorder.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the Division
of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the Department of Human Services is
required to administer the program to provide tax incentives to certified
employers for hiring and employing eligible individuals in recovery from a
substance use disorder in part-time or full-time employment in the State.  For
an employer to be certified under the bill, the employer is required to provide
employer sponsored insurance coverage that meets certain minimum essential
coverage requirements, and meet certain other requirements.  The bill authorizes
the Director of the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the
Department of Human Services (director) to allocate up to $2,000,000 of tax
credits for the program for each calendar year beginning on January 1, 2023, to
be credited against the Corporation Business Tax or the Gross Income Tax. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To participate in the program,
an employer is required to apply annually to the Division of Mental Health and
Addiction Services (division) to claim credit based on the number of hours
worked by eligible individuals employed during the preceding calendar year. 
The director is required to issue a tax credit certificate to employers by
March 31 each year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies that a
certified employer is generally entitled to a tax credit equal to the product
of $1 multiplied by the number of hours worked by each eligible individual
hired and employed by the certified employer during that eligible individual's
period of employment, provided that a credit is not to be allowed unless an
eligible individual has worked in the State for a minimum of 500 hours for the
employer and that the credit per eligible individual is prohibited from
exceeding $2,000.  The bill further specifies, however, that in determining the
amount of credit that any employer may claim, the director is required to
review all claims submitted for credit by employers and, to the extent that the
total amount claimed by employers exceeds the amount allocated for the program
in that calendar year, is required to issue credits on a pro rata basis
corresponding to each employers share of the total claimed amount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a certified
employer is permitted to claim a credit for the period starting on the day the
employee is hired and ending on December 31 of the immediately succeeding calendar
year or the last day of the employee's employment by the certified employer,
whichever comes first.  If, however, an eligible individual has worked in
excess of 500 hours between the date of hiring and December 31 of that year, an
employer may elect to compute and claim a credit for such employee for that
year based on the hours worked by December 31, or may elect to include the
hours worked by the eligible individual in the computation of the credit in the
year immediately succeeding the year in which the eligible individual was
hired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, certified
employers are prohibited from claiming a tax credit for hours worked by an
eligible individual in excess of 2,000 hours, from claiming credit more than
once with respect to any eligible individual, and from aggregating hours worked
by two or more employees to reach the minimum number of hours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the director
to annually provide certain program information to the Director of the Division
of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The director is also required,
in consultation with Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of
the Treasury, to adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of the
program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the amount of
the credits allowed against the taxes imposed are prohibited from exceeding 50
percent of the taxpayer's liability for tax, and may be carried over, if
necessary, to the seven privilege periods or taxable years.  The bill also
provides for the allocation of tax credits under the program to certain
certified employers. </p>
