(cf: P.L.1992, c.210, s.1) 11.  This act shall take effect on the 30th day next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill would exempt New Jersey residents 65 years of age and older from being required to pay any fee to obtain any hunting or trapping license, permit, certificate, or stamp, and to obtain a fishing license. Current law requires hunters, trappers, and fishermen to pay certain fees in order to obtain various hunting, trapping, or fishing licenses, permits, certificates, or stamps.  State residents over the age of 65 who are applying for a firearm hunting license, an apprentice firearm hunting license, a bow and arrow license, an apprentice bow and arrow license, or a trapping license are entitled to a discounted fee. State residents 70 years of age and older are not required to obtain a fishing license under current law. This bill would allow State residents 65 years of age and older to obtain any hunting or trapping license, permit, certificate, or stamp without being required to pay any fee.  The bill would also exempt fishermen 65 years of age and older from being required to obtain a fishing license.

STATEMENT This bill would exempt New Jersey residents 65 years of age and older from being required to pay any fee to obtain any hunting or trapping license, permit, certificate, or stamp, and to obtain a fishing license. Current law requires hunters, trappers, and fishermen to pay certain fees in order to obtain various hunting, trapping, or fishing licenses, permits, certificates, or stamps.  State residents over the age of 65 who are applying for a firearm hunting license, an apprentice firearm hunting license, a bow and arrow license, an apprentice bow and arrow license, or a trapping license are entitled to a discounted fee. State residents 70 years of age and older are not required to obtain a fishing license under current law. This bill would allow State residents 65 years of age and older to obtain any hunting or trapping license, permit, certificate, or stamp without being required to pay any fee.  The bill would also exempt fishermen 65 years of age and older from being required to obtain a fishing license.
