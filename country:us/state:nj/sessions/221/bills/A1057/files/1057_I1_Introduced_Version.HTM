(cf: P.L.2003, c.89, s.60) 2.    Section 2 of P.L.1968, c.385 (17:28-1.1) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  Except for a basic automobile insurance policy, no motor vehicle liability policy or renewal of such policy of insurance, including a standard liability policy for an automobile as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2), insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death, sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, shall be issued in this State with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State unless it includes coverage in limits for bodily injury or death as follows: (1)   an amount or limit of [$15,000.00] $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one person, in any one accident, and (2)   an amount or limit, subject to such limit for any one person so injured or killed, of [$30,000.00] $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to or death of more than one person, in any one accident, under provisions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, for payment of all or part of the sums which the insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the operator or owner of an uninsured motor vehicle, underinsured motor vehicle, or hit and run motor vehicle, as defined in section 18 of P.L.1952, c.174 (C.39:6-78), because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom, sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of such uninsured , underinsured or hit and run motor vehicle anywhere within the United States or Canada; except that uninsured motorist coverage shall provide that in order to recover for non-economic loss, as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2), for accidents to which the benefits of section 4 (C.39:6A-4) of that act apply, the tort option elected pursuant to section 8 (C.39:6A-8) of that act shall apply to that injured person. All motor vehicle liability policies, except basic automobile insurance policies, shall also include coverage for the payment of all or part of the sums which persons insured thereunder shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from owners or operators of uninsured and underinsured motor vehicles, other than hit and run motor vehicles, because of injury to or destruction to the personal property of such insured, with a limit in the aggregate for all insurers involved in any one accident of [$5,000.00] $25,000, and subject, for each insured, to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such damages. b.    Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall be provided, as an option by an insurer to the named insured electing a standard automobile insurance policy, up to at least the following limits: $250,000.00 each person and $500,000.00 each accident for bodily injury; $100,000.00 each accident for property damage or $500,000.00 single limit, subject to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such damage to property for each accident, except that the limits for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall not exceed the insured's motor vehicle liability policy limits for bodily injury and property damage, respectively. Rates for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for the same limits shall, for each filer, be uniform on a Statewide basis without regard to classification or territory. c.     Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage provided for in this section shall not be increased by stacking the limits of coverage of multiple motor vehicles covered under the same policy of insurance nor shall these coverages be increased by stacking the limits of coverage of multiple policies available to the insured. If the insured had uninsured motorist coverage available under more than one policy, any recovery shall not exceed the higher of the applicable limits of the respective coverages and the recovery shall be prorated between the applicable coverages as the limits of each coverage bear to the total of the limits. d.    Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall be subject to the policy terms, conditions and exclusions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, including, but not limited to, unauthorized settlements, non-duplication of coverage, subrogation and arbitration. e.     For the purpose of this section,  (1)  "underinsured motorist coverage" means insurance for damages because of bodily injury and property damage resulting from an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an underinsured motor vehicle. Underinsured motorist coverage shall not apply to an uninsured motor vehicle.  A motor vehicle is underinsured when the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury and property damage liability bonds and insurance policies available to a person against whom recovery is sought for bodily injury or property damage is, at the time of the accident, less than the applicable limits for underinsured motorist coverage afforded under the motor vehicle insurance policy held by the person seeking that recovery.  A motor vehicle shall not be considered an underinsured motor vehicle under this section unless the limits of all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of settlements or judgments.  The limits of underinsured motorist coverage available to an injured person shall be reduced by the amount he has recovered under all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds; (2)   "uninsured motor vehicle" means: (a)   a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of which there is no bodily injury liability insurance or bond applicable at the time of the accident; (b)   a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of which there is bodily injury liability insurance in existence but the liability insurer denies coverage or is unable to make payment with respect to the legal liability of its insured because the insurer has become insolvent or bankrupt, or the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance has undertaken control of the insurer for the purpose of liquidation; (c)   a hit and run motor vehicle as described in section 18 of P.L.1952, c.174 (C.39:6-78); or (d)   an automobile covered by a special automobile insurance policy pursuant to section 45 of P.L.2003, c.89 (C.39:6A-3.3). "Uninsured motor vehicle" shall not include an automobile covered by a basic automobile insurance policy; an underinsured motor vehicle; a motor vehicle owned by or furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any resident of the same household; a self-insurer within the meaning of any financial responsibility or similar law of the state in which the motor vehicle is registered or principally garaged; a motor vehicle which is owned by the United States or Canada, or a state, political subdivision or agency of those governments or any of the foregoing; a land motor vehicle or trailer operated on rails or crawler treads; a motor vehicle used as a residence or stationary structure and not as a vehicle; or equipment or vehicles designed for use principally off public roads, except while actually upon public roads. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any other law to the contrary, a motor vehicle liability policy or renewal of such policy of insurance, insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death, sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, issued in this State to a corporate or business entity with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State, shall not provide less uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for an individual employed by the corporate or business entity than the coverage provided to the named insured under the policy. A policy that names a corporate or business entity as a named insured shall be deemed to provide the maximum uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage available under the policy to an individual employed by the corporate or business entity, regardless of whether the individual is an additional named insured under that policy or is a named insured or is covered under any other policy providing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. (cf: P.L.2007, c.163, s.1) 3.    Section 3 of P.L.1952, c.173 (C.39:6-25) is amended to read as follows: 3.    (a)  If 20 days after the receipt of a report of a motor vehicle accident within this State which has resulted in bodily injury or death, or damage to the property of any one person in excess of $500.00, the director does not have on file evidence satisfactory to him that the person who would otherwise be required to file security under subsection (b) of this section has been released from liability, or has been finally adjudicated not to be liable, or has executed a duly acknowledged written agreement providing for the payment of an agreed amount in installments with respect to all claims for injuries or damages resulting from the accident, and in the event of an accident involving an automobile, required to have coverage for personal injury protection benefits pursuant to P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-1 et seq.), has also reimbursed or has executed a duly acknowledged written agreement to pay an agreed amount in installments to reimburse the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund for the payment of all personal injury protection benefits the fund has made or shall make pursuant to section 7 or section 10 of P.L.1972, c.198 (C.39:6-86.1 and C.39:6-86.4) by reason of the failure of such person to have the requisite insurance coverage in effect, the [director] chief administrator shall determine the amount of security which may be necessary in his judgment to satisfy any reimbursement, judgment or judgments for damages resulting from such accident as may be recovered against each operator or owner in view of the total insurance protection available to the injured party. The [Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles] Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission shall promulgate such rules as may be necessary to set forth those instances where deposit of security is necessary. (b)   The [director] chief administrator may, within 90 days after the receipt of such report of a motor vehicle accident, suspend the license of each operator and all registrations of each owner of a motor vehicle in any manner involved in such accident, and if such operator is a nonresident the privilege of operating a motor vehicle within this State, and if such owner is a nonresident the privilege of the use within this State of any motor vehicle owned by him, unless such operator or owner or both shall deposit security in the sum so determined by the [director] chief administrator; provided, notice of such suspension shall be sent by the [director] chief administrator to such operator and owner not less than 10 days prior to the effective date of such suspension and shall state the amount required as security.  Where erroneous information is given the director with respect to the matters set forth in paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of subsection (c) of this section, he may take appropriate action as hereinbefore provided, within 90 days after receipt by him of correct information with respect to said matters. (c)   This section shall not apply under the conditions stated in section 4 of this act nor: (1)   To such operator or owner, if such owner had in effect, at the time of such accident, a motor vehicle liability policy with respect to the motor vehicle involved in such accident; (2)   To such operator, if not the owner of such motor vehicle, if there was in effect at the time of such accident a motor vehicle liability policy or bond with respect to his operation of motor vehicles not owned by him; (3)   To such operator or owner if the liability of such operator or owner for damages resulting from such accident is, in the judgment of the [director] chief administrator, covered by any other form of liability insurance policy or bond; [nor] or (4)   To any person qualifying as a self-insurer under section 30 of this act, or to any person operating a motor vehicle for such self-insurer. No such policy or bond shall be effective under this section unless issued by an insurance company or surety company authorized to do business in this State, except that if such motor vehicle was not registered in this State, or was a motor vehicle which was registered elsewhere than in this State at the effective date of the policy or bond, or the most recent renewal thereof, such policy or bond shall not be effective under this section unless the insurance company or surety company if not authorized to do business in this State shall execute a power of attorney authorizing the [director] chief administrator to accept service on its behalf of notice or process in any action upon such policy or bond arising out of such accident; provided, however, every such policy or bond is  subject, if the accident has resulted in bodily injury or death, to a limit, exclusive of interest and costs, of not less than [$15,000.00] $50,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and, subject to said limit for one person, to a limit of not less than [$30,000.00] $100,000 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and, if the accident has resulted in injury to or destruction of property, to a limit of not less than [$5,000.00] $25,000 because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident and if policy or bond is applicable to an automobile required to have coverage for personal injury protection benefits pursuant to P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-1 et seq.), it shall include an amount to cover personal injury protection benefits as required by that act. (cf: P.L.1988, c.119, s.12) 4.    Section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1) is amended to read as follows: 4.    As an alternative to the mandatory coverages provided in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-3 and 39:6A-4), any owner or registered owner of an automobile registered or principally garaged in this State may elect a basic automobile insurance policy providing the following coverage: a.     Personal injury protection coverage, for the payment of benefits without regard to negligence, liability or fault of any kind, to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household, who sustained bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile, or as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile, and to other persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named insured, with the permission of the named insured.  "Personal injury protection coverage" issued pursuant to this section means and includes payment of medical expense benefits, as provided in the policy and approved by the commissioner, for the reasonable and necessary treatment of bodily injury in an amount not to exceed $15,000 per person per accident; except that, medical expense benefits shall be paid in an amount not to exceed $250,000: (1) for all medically necessary treatment of permanent or significant brain injury, spinal cord injury or disfigurement or (2) for medically necessary treatment of other permanent or significant injuries rendered at a trauma center or acute care hospital immediately following the accident and until the patient is stable, no longer requires critical care and can be safely discharged or transferred to another facility in the judgment of the attending physician.  In the event benefits paid by an insurer pursuant to this subsection are in excess of $75,000 on account of personal injury to any one person in any one accident covered by a policy issued or renewed prior to January 1, 2004, such excess shall be paid by the insurer and shall be reimbursable to the insurer from the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1977, c.310 (C.39:6-73.1).  Benefits provided under basic coverage shall be in accordance with a benefit plan provided in the policy and approved by the commissioner.  The policy form, which shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner, shall set forth the benefits provided under the policy, including eligible medical treatments, diagnostic tests and services as well as such other benefits as the policy may provide.  The commissioner shall set forth by regulation a statement of the basic benefits which shall be included in the policy.  Medical treatments, diagnostic tests, and services provided by the policy shall be rendered in accordance with commonly accepted protocols and professional standards and practices which are commonly accepted as being beneficial for the treatment of the covered injury. Protocols and professional standards and practices which are deemed to be commonly accepted pursuant to this section shall be those recognized by national standard setting organizations, national or state professional organizations of the same discipline as the treating provider, or those designated or approved by the commissioner in consultation with the professional licensing boards in the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. The commissioner, in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health and Senior Services and the applicable licensing boards, may reject the use of protocols, standards and practices or lists of diagnostic tests set by any organization deemed not to have standing or general recognition by the provider community or the applicable licensing boards. Protocols shall be deemed to establish guidelines as to standard appropriate treatment and diagnostic tests for injuries sustained in automobile accidents, but the establishment of standard treatment protocols or protocols for the administration of diagnostic tests shall not be interpreted in such a manner as to preclude variance from the standard when warranted by reason of medical necessity.  The policy form may provide for the precertification of certain procedures, treatments, diagnostic tests, or other services or for the purchase of durable medical goods, as approved by the commissioner, provided that the requirement for precertification shall not be unreasonable, and no precertification requirement shall apply within ten days of the insured event.  The policy may provide that certain benefits provided by the policy which are in excess of the basic benefits required by the commissioner to be included in the policy may be subject to reasonable copayments in addition to the copayments provided for herein, provided that the copayments shall not be unreasonable and shall be established in such a manner as not to serve to encourage underutilization of benefits subject to the copayments, nor encourage overutilization of benefits.  The policy form shall clearly set forth any limitations on benefits or exclusions, which may include, but need not be limited to, benefits which are otherwise compensable under workers' compensation, or benefits for treatments deemed to be experimental or investigational, or benefits deducted pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-6).  The commissioner may enlist the services of a benefit consultant in establishing the basic benefits level provided in this subsection, which shall be set forth by regulation no later than 120 days following the enactment date of this amendatory and supplementary act.  The commissioner shall not advertise for the consultant as provided in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-8 and 52:34-9). Medical expense benefits payable under this subsection shall not be assignable, except to a provider of service benefits, in accordance with policy terms approved by the commissioner, nor shall they be subject to levy, execution, attachment or other process for satisfaction of debts.  Medical expense benefits payable in accordance with this subsection may be subject to a deductible and copayments as provided for in the policy, if any.  No insurer or provider providing service benefits to an insured shall have a right of subrogation for the amount of benefits paid pursuant to any deductible or copayment under this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.2003, c.18, physical therapy treatment shall not be reimbursable as medical expense benefits pursuant to this subsection unless rendered by a licensed physical therapist pursuant to a referral from a licensed physician, dentist, podiatrist or chiropractor within the scope of their respective practices. Notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.2009, c.56 (C.45:2C-19 et al.), acupuncture treatment shall not be reimbursable as medical expense benefits pursuant to this subsection unless rendered by a licensed acupuncturist pursuant to a referral from a licensed physician within the scope of the physician's practice. b.    Liability insurance coverage insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for property damage sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an automobile in an amount or limit of [$5,000] $15,000, exclusive of interest and costs, for damage to property in any one accident. c.     In addition to the aforesaid coverages required to be provided in a basic automobile insurance policy, optional liability insurance coverage insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death in an amount or limit of $10,000, exclusive of interests and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one or more persons in any one accident. If a named insured has elected the basic automobile insurance policy option and an immediate family member or members or relatives resident in his household have one or more policies with the coverages provided for in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-3 and 39:6A-4), the provisions of section 12 of P.L.1983, c.362 (C.39:6A-4.2) shall apply. Every named insured and any other person to whom the basic automobile insurance policy, with or without the optional $10,000 liability coverage insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death provided for in subsection c. of this section, applies shall be subject to the tort option provided in subsection a. of section 8 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-8). No licensed insurance carrier shall refuse to renew the coverage stipulated by this section of an eligible person as defined in section 25 of P.L.1990, c.8 (C.17:33B-13) except in accordance with the provisions of section 26 of P.L.1988, c.119 (C.17:29C-7.1) or with the consent of the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. (cf: P.L.2009, c.56, s.17) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill raises the minimum amounts of property damage liability, uninsured motorist, and underinsured motorist coverage for certain automobile insurance policies. Under this bill, the minimum amount of coverage for uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverage under a standard automobile insurance policy is raised to $50,000 for an accident causing bodily injury or death to a single person, $100,000 for an accident causing the injury or death of more than one person, and $25,000 for damage to property in an accident that does not involve hit and run motor vehicles.  Additionally, this bill raises the minimum amount of liability coverage for property damage under a basic automobile insurance policy to $15,000 per accident.

"Uninsured motor vehicle" shall not include an automobile covered by a basic automobile insurance policy; an underinsured motor vehicle; a motor vehicle owned by or furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any resident of the same household; a self-insurer within the meaning of any financial responsibility or similar law of the state in which the motor vehicle is registered or principally garaged; a motor vehicle which is owned by the United States or Canada, or a state, political subdivision or agency of those governments or any of the foregoing; a land motor vehicle or trailer operated on rails or crawler treads; a motor vehicle used as a residence or stationary structure and not as a vehicle; or equipment or vehicles designed for use principally off public roads, except while actually upon public roads. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any other law to the contrary, a motor vehicle liability policy or renewal of such policy of insurance, insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death, sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, issued in this State to a corporate or business entity with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State, shall not provide less uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for an individual employed by the corporate or business entity than the coverage provided to the named insured under the policy. A policy that names a corporate or business entity as a named insured shall be deemed to provide the maximum uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage available under the policy to an individual employed by the corporate or business entity, regardless of whether the individual is an additional named insured under that policy or is a named insured or is covered under any other policy providing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. (cf: P.L.2007, c.163, s.1) 3.    Section 3 of P.L.1952, c.173 (C.39:6-25) is amended to read as follows: 3.    (a)  If 20 days after the receipt of a report of a motor vehicle accident within this State which has resulted in bodily injury or death, or damage to the property of any one person in excess of $500.00, the director does not have on file evidence satisfactory to him that the person who would otherwise be required to file security under subsection (b) of this section has been released from liability, or has been finally adjudicated not to be liable, or has executed a duly acknowledged written agreement providing for the payment of an agreed amount in installments with respect to all claims for injuries or damages resulting from the accident, and in the event of an accident involving an automobile, required to have coverage for personal injury protection benefits pursuant to P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-1 et seq.), has also reimbursed or has executed a duly acknowledged written agreement to pay an agreed amount in installments to reimburse the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund for the payment of all personal injury protection benefits the fund has made or shall make pursuant to section 7 or section 10 of P.L.1972, c.198 (C.39:6-86.1 and C.39:6-86.4) by reason of the failure of such person to have the requisite insurance coverage in effect, the [director] chief administrator shall determine the amount of security which may be necessary in his judgment to satisfy any reimbursement, judgment or judgments for damages resulting from such accident as may be recovered against each operator or owner in view of the total insurance protection available to the injured party. The [Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles] Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission shall promulgate such rules as may be necessary to set forth those instances where deposit of security is necessary. (b)   The [director] chief administrator may, within 90 days after the receipt of such report of a motor vehicle accident, suspend the license of each operator and all registrations of each owner of a motor vehicle in any manner involved in such accident, and if such operator is a nonresident the privilege of operating a motor vehicle within this State, and if such owner is a nonresident the privilege of the use within this State of any motor vehicle owned by him, unless such operator or owner or both shall deposit security in the sum so determined by the [director] chief administrator; provided, notice of such suspension shall be sent by the [director] chief administrator to such operator and owner not less than 10 days prior to the effective date of such suspension and shall state the amount required as security.  Where erroneous information is given the director with respect to the matters set forth in paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of subsection (c) of this section, he may take appropriate action as hereinbefore provided, within 90 days after receipt by him of correct information with respect to said matters. (c)   This section shall not apply under the conditions stated in section 4 of this act nor: (1)   To such operator or owner, if such owner had in effect, at the time of such accident, a motor vehicle liability policy with respect to the motor vehicle involved in such accident; (2)   To such operator, if not the owner of such motor vehicle, if there was in effect at the time of such accident a motor vehicle liability policy or bond with respect to his operation of motor vehicles not owned by him; (3)   To such operator or owner if the liability of such operator or owner for damages resulting from such accident is, in the judgment of the [director] chief administrator, covered by any other form of liability insurance policy or bond; [nor] or (4)   To any person qualifying as a self-insurer under section 30 of this act, or to any person operating a motor vehicle for such self-insurer. No such policy or bond shall be effective under this section unless issued by an insurance company or surety company authorized to do business in this State, except that if such motor vehicle was not registered in this State, or was a motor vehicle which was registered elsewhere than in this State at the effective date of the policy or bond, or the most recent renewal thereof, such policy or bond shall not be effective under this section unless the insurance company or surety company if not authorized to do business in this State shall execute a power of attorney authorizing the [director] chief administrator to accept service on its behalf of notice or process in any action upon such policy or bond arising out of such accident; provided, however, every such policy or bond is  subject, if the accident has resulted in bodily injury or death, to a limit, exclusive of interest and costs, of not less than [$15,000.00] $50,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and, subject to said limit for one person, to a limit of not less than [$30,000.00] $100,000 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and, if the accident has resulted in injury to or destruction of property, to a limit of not less than [$5,000.00] $25,000 because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident and if policy or bond is applicable to an automobile required to have coverage for personal injury protection benefits pursuant to P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-1 et seq.), it shall include an amount to cover personal injury protection benefits as required by that act. (cf: P.L.1988, c.119, s.12) 4.    Section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1) is amended to read as follows: 4.    As an alternative to the mandatory coverages provided in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-3 and 39:6A-4), any owner or registered owner of an automobile registered or principally garaged in this State may elect a basic automobile insurance policy providing the following coverage: a.     Personal injury protection coverage, for the payment of benefits without regard to negligence, liability or fault of any kind, to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household, who sustained bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile, or as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile, and to other persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named insured, with the permission of the named insured.  "Personal injury protection coverage" issued pursuant to this section means and includes payment of medical expense benefits, as provided in the policy and approved by the commissioner, for the reasonable and necessary treatment of bodily injury in an amount not to exceed $15,000 per person per accident; except that, medical expense benefits shall be paid in an amount not to exceed $250,000: (1) for all medically necessary treatment of permanent or significant brain injury, spinal cord injury or disfigurement or (2) for medically necessary treatment of other permanent or significant injuries rendered at a trauma center or acute care hospital immediately following the accident and until the patient is stable, no longer requires critical care and can be safely discharged or transferred to another facility in the judgment of the attending physician.  In the event benefits paid by an insurer pursuant to this subsection are in excess of $75,000 on account of personal injury to any one person in any one accident covered by a policy issued or renewed prior to January 1, 2004, such excess shall be paid by the insurer and shall be reimbursable to the insurer from the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1977, c.310 (C.39:6-73.1).  Benefits provided under basic coverage shall be in accordance with a benefit plan provided in the policy and approved by the commissioner.  The policy form, which shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner, shall set forth the benefits provided under the policy, including eligible medical treatments, diagnostic tests and services as well as such other benefits as the policy may provide.  The commissioner shall set forth by regulation a statement of the basic benefits which shall be included in the policy.  Medical treatments, diagnostic tests, and services provided by the policy shall be rendered in accordance with commonly accepted protocols and professional standards and practices which are commonly accepted as being beneficial for the treatment of the covered injury. Protocols and professional standards and practices which are deemed to be commonly accepted pursuant to this section shall be those recognized by national standard setting organizations, national or state professional organizations of the same discipline as the treating provider, or those designated or approved by the commissioner in consultation with the professional licensing boards in the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. The commissioner, in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health and Senior Services and the applicable licensing boards, may reject the use of protocols, standards and practices or lists of diagnostic tests set by any organization deemed not to have standing or general recognition by the provider community or the applicable licensing boards. Protocols shall be deemed to establish guidelines as to standard appropriate treatment and diagnostic tests for injuries sustained in automobile accidents, but the establishment of standard treatment protocols or protocols for the administration of diagnostic tests shall not be interpreted in such a manner as to preclude variance from the standard when warranted by reason of medical necessity.  The policy form may provide for the precertification of certain procedures, treatments, diagnostic tests, or other services or for the purchase of durable medical goods, as approved by the commissioner, provided that the requirement for precertification shall not be unreasonable, and no precertification requirement shall apply within ten days of the insured event.  The policy may provide that certain benefits provided by the policy which are in excess of the basic benefits required by the commissioner to be included in the policy may be subject to reasonable copayments in addition to the copayments provided for herein, provided that the copayments shall not be unreasonable and shall be established in such a manner as not to serve to encourage underutilization of benefits subject to the copayments, nor encourage overutilization of benefits.  The policy form shall clearly set forth any limitations on benefits or exclusions, which may include, but need not be limited to, benefits which are otherwise compensable under workers' compensation, or benefits for treatments deemed to be experimental or investigational, or benefits deducted pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-6).  The commissioner may enlist the services of a benefit consultant in establishing the basic benefits level provided in this subsection, which shall be set forth by regulation no later than 120 days following the enactment date of this amendatory and supplementary act.  The commissioner shall not advertise for the consultant as provided in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-8 and 52:34-9). Medical expense benefits payable under this subsection shall not be assignable, except to a provider of service benefits, in accordance with policy terms approved by the commissioner, nor shall they be subject to levy, execution, attachment or other process for satisfaction of debts.  Medical expense benefits payable in accordance with this subsection may be subject to a deductible and copayments as provided for in the policy, if any.  No insurer or provider providing service benefits to an insured shall have a right of subrogation for the amount of benefits paid pursuant to any deductible or copayment under this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.2003, c.18, physical therapy treatment shall not be reimbursable as medical expense benefits pursuant to this subsection unless rendered by a licensed physical therapist pursuant to a referral from a licensed physician, dentist, podiatrist or chiropractor within the scope of their respective practices. Notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.2009, c.56 (C.45:2C-19 et al.), acupuncture treatment shall not be reimbursable as medical expense benefits pursuant to this subsection unless rendered by a licensed acupuncturist pursuant to a referral from a licensed physician within the scope of the physician's practice. b.    Liability insurance coverage insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for property damage sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an automobile in an amount or limit of [$5,000] $15,000, exclusive of interest and costs, for damage to property in any one accident. c.     In addition to the aforesaid coverages required to be provided in a basic automobile insurance policy, optional liability insurance coverage insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death in an amount or limit of $10,000, exclusive of interests and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one or more persons in any one accident. If a named insured has elected the basic automobile insurance policy option and an immediate family member or members or relatives resident in his household have one or more policies with the coverages provided for in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-3 and 39:6A-4), the provisions of section 12 of P.L.1983, c.362 (C.39:6A-4.2) shall apply. Every named insured and any other person to whom the basic automobile insurance policy, with or without the optional $10,000 liability coverage insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death provided for in subsection c. of this section, applies shall be subject to the tort option provided in subsection a. of section 8 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-8). No licensed insurance carrier shall refuse to renew the coverage stipulated by this section of an eligible person as defined in section 25 of P.L.1990, c.8 (C.17:33B-13) except in accordance with the provisions of section 26 of P.L.1988, c.119 (C.17:29C-7.1) or with the consent of the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. (cf: P.L.2009, c.56, s.17) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill raises the minimum amounts of property damage liability, uninsured motorist, and underinsured motorist coverage for certain automobile insurance policies. Under this bill, the minimum amount of coverage for uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverage under a standard automobile insurance policy is raised to $50,000 for an accident causing bodily injury or death to a single person, $100,000 for an accident causing the injury or death of more than one person, and $25,000 for damage to property in an accident that does not involve hit and run motor vehicles.  Additionally, this bill raises the minimum amount of liability coverage for property damage under a basic automobile insurance policy to $15,000 per accident.
