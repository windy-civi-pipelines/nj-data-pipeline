motor vehicle. Underinsured motorist coverage shall not apply to an uninsured
motor vehicle.  A motor vehicle is underinsured when the sum of the limits of
liability under all bodily injury and property damage liability bonds and
insurance policies available to a person against whom recovery is sought for
bodily injury or property damage is, at the time of the accident, less than the
applicable limits for underinsured motorist coverage afforded under the motor
vehicle insurance policy held by the person seeking that recovery.  A motor
vehicle shall not be considered an underinsured motor vehicle under this
section unless the limits of all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds
applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of
settlements or judgments.  The limits of underinsured motorist coverage

vehicle, issued in this State to a corporate or business entity with respect to
any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State, shall not
provide less uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for an individual
employed by the corporate or business entity than the coverage provided to the
named insured under the policy. A policy that names a corporate or business
entity as a named insured shall be deemed to provide the maximum uninsured or

providing the following coverage:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Personal injury
protection coverage, for the payment of benefits without regard to negligence,
liability or fault of any kind, to the named insured and members of his family
residing in his household, who sustained bodily injury as a result of an
accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile,
or as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from

entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named insured,
with the permission of the named insured.  &quot;Personal injury protection

commissioner, for the reasonable and necessary treatment of bodily injury in an
amount not to exceed $15,000 per person per accident; except that, medical
expense benefits shall be paid in an amount not to exceed $250,000: (1) for all
medically necessary treatment of permanent or significant brain injury, spinal
cord injury or disfigurement or (2) for medically necessary treatment of other
permanent or significant injuries rendered at a trauma center or acute care
hospital immediately following the accident and until the patient is stable, no
longer requires critical care and can be safely discharged or transferred to
another facility in the judgment of the attending physician.  In the event
benefits paid by an insurer pursuant to this subsection are in excess of
$75,000 on account of personal injury to any one person in any one accident
covered by a policy issued or renewed prior to January 1, 2004, such excess

accordance with a benefit plan provided in the policy and approved by the
commissioner.&nbsp; The policy form, which shall be subject to the approval of
the commissioner, shall set forth the benefits provided under the policy,
including eligible medical treatments, diagnostic tests and services as well as
such other benefits as the policy may provide.&nbsp; The commissioner shall set
forth by regulation a statement of the basic benefits which shall be included
in the policy.&nbsp; Medical treatments, diagnostic tests, and services provided
by the policy shall be rendered in accordance with commonly accepted protocols

beneficial for the treatment of the covered injury. Protocols and professional
standards and practices which are deemed to be commonly accepted pursuant to
this section shall be those recognized by national standard setting
organizations, national or state professional organizations of the same
discipline as the treating provider, or those designated or approved by the
commissioner in consultation with the professional licensing boards in the
Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. The
commissioner, in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health
and Senior Services and the applicable licensing boards, may reject the use of
protocols, standards and practices or lists of diagnostic tests set by any
organization deemed not to have standing or general recognition by the provider
community or the applicable licensing boards. Protocols shall be deemed to
establish guidelines as to standard appropriate treatment and diagnostic tests
for injuries sustained in automobile accidents, but the establishment of
standard treatment protocols or protocols for the administration of diagnostic
tests shall not be interpreted in such a manner as to preclude variance from
the standard when warranted by reason of medical necessity.  The policy form
may provide for the precertification of certain procedures, treatments, diagnostic
tests, or other services or for the purchase of durable medical goods, as
approved by the commissioner, provided that the requirement for
precertification shall not be unreasonable, and no precertification requirement
shall apply within ten days of the insured event.  The policy may provide that
certain benefits provided by the policy which are in excess of the basic
benefits required by the commissioner to be included in the policy may be
subject to reasonable copayments in addition to the copayments provided for
herein, provided that the copayments shall not be unreasonable and shall be
established in such a manner as not to serve to encourage underutilization of
benefits subject to the copayments, nor encourage overutilization of benefits.  The
policy form shall clearly set forth any limitations on benefits or exclusions,
which may include, but need not be limited to, benefits which are otherwise
compensable under workers' compensation, or benefits for treatments deemed to
be experimental or investigational, or benefits deducted pursuant to section 6
of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-6).  The commissioner may enlist the services of a
benefit consultant in establishing the basic benefits level provided in this
subsection, which shall be set forth by regulation no later than 120 days
following the enactment date of this amendatory and supplementary act.  The
commissioner shall not advertise for the consultant as provided in sections 3

this subsection may be subject to a deductible and copayments as provided for
