Upon determining that a long-term care facility is not in compliance with State and federal requirements related to health, safety, and operations, and particularly when determining that a facility has repeatedly violated the same health, safety, or operational requirement or that a facility has a health, safety, or operational violation with a severity rating of I or higher, an inspector will be permitted to consult with superiors within the department, and document quality assurance activities, when developing a corrective plan for the facility.
