<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  The Department of
Health shall develop minimum standards for nursing homes for the metrics
outlined in each of the following categories:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the physical well-being
of residents, as determined based on the number of residents who develop bed
sores, the number of resident falls, the use of physical restraints on
residents, the number of residents who develop urinary tract infections, the
number of residents who are hospitalized, and significant fluctuations in
resident weight;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the mental well-being of
residents, as determined based on the number of residents who are administered
antipsychotic medications, the number of planned group activities and the
percentage of residents participating in planned group activities, and the
number of residents exhibiting symptoms of depression; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the nursing homes
operational metrics, as determined based on the facilitys CoreQ score, the
number of residents vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, the number of residents who
have received the seasonal influenza vaccination, staff turnover at the
facility, the number of single-occupancy rooms at the facility as compared
against the number of multiple-occupancy rooms at the facility, the percentages
of the resident census residing in single-occupancy and multiple-occupancy
rooms, and the numbers of alleged and verified incidents involving abuse,
neglect, or exploitation of facility residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Department of Human
Services and the Department of Health shall annually conduct a joint review of
the standards developed by the Department of Health in the categories outlined
in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection a. of this section to determine
their efficacy in evaluating health, safety, and operations in nursing homes,
as well as the effectiveness of sanctions, corrective action plans, and other
measures used by the Department of Human Services and the Department of Health
to respond to a nursing home that fails to comply with health, safety, and
operational requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  In the event that a
nursing home receives a one-star rating from the federal Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, or fails to meet at least two of the standards developed
by the Department of Health in each of the categories outlined in paragraphs
(1), (2), and (3) of subsection a. of section 1 of this act, and the nursing
home received a rating of two stars or higher in each of the three quarters
preceding the quarter in which the facility received a one-star rating, the
Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in the Department of Human
Services shall issue a warning to the nursing home:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) urging the nursing home to
improve the quality of care provided to residents; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) advising the nursing home
that a second or subsequent one-star rating may result in the division
requiring the nursing home to take specific steps to improve the quality of
care; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) advising the nursing home
that the failure to improve quality of care at the nursing home may result in
the division imposing sanctions against the nursing home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In the event a nursing
home receives a one-star rating from the federal Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, or fails to meet at least two of the standards developed by
the Department of Health in each of the categories outlined in paragraphs (1),
(2), and (3) of subsection a. of section 1 of this act, in any two of the
preceding four quarters, the division shall evaluate whether to impose
sanctions against the nursing home, which sanctions may include, but shall not
be limited to:  issuing an order prohibiting the nursing home from admitting
new Medicaid enrollees; limiting the total number of Medicaid enrollees who may
be admitted to the nursing home; and reducing or limiting payments to the
nursing home under the Department of Human Services quality incentive payment
program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In the event a nursing
home receives a one-star rating from the federal Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, or fails to meet at least two of the standards developed by
the Department of Health in each of the categories outlined in paragraphs (1),
(2), and (3) of subsection a. of section 1 of this act, in any three of the
preceding four quarters, the division shall evaluate whether to impose
additional sanctions against the nursing home, which sanctions shall be in
addition to, and more severe than, any sanctions imposed pursuant to subsection
b. of this section.  Sanctions imposed pursuant to this subsection may include,
but shall not be limited to:  issuing an order prohibiting the nursing home
from admitting new residents; removing current residents who are Medicaid
enrollees from the nursing home; suspending all payments to the nursing home
under the Department of Human Services quality incentive payment program;
declining to approve or revoking the approval of the owner or operator of the
nursing home to participate in Medicaid; and, in consultation with the
Department of Health, prohibiting the owner or operator of the nursing home
from obtaining an interest in, or contracting with, any other nursing home in
the State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1)  In addition to any
other actions taken pursuant to subsection b. or c. of this section, the
division shall require a nursing home that receives a one-star rating from the
federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or fails to meet at least
two of the standards developed by the Department of Health in each of the
categories outlined in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection a. of section
1 of this act, in any three of the preceding four quarters, to submit an
improvement plan to the division, in a manner and method to be determined by
the division, providing a description of the action steps to be taken by the
nursing home over an 18-month period to resolve the quality issues indicated by
facilitys consecutive one-star ratings or continuing failure to meet at least
two of the standards developed by the Department of Health in the categories
outlined in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection a. of section 1of this
act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The division, in
consultation with the Department of Health, shall review a plan submitted by a
nursing home pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.  A nursing home
shall immediately commence implementing the plan upon written approval by the
division.  If the division does not approve a nursing homes improvement plan,
the division shall return the disapproved plan to the nursing home with a

division.  At the divisions discretion, a nursing home determined to be
noncompliant with the implementation of its improvement plan may be provided
additional time to fulfill the actions steps outlined in the plan.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  a process by which a
nursing home deemed to be in noncompliance with the requirements of subsection

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises the
requirements to take action against low-performing nursing homes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
requires the Department of Health (DOH) to develop standards in three
categories encompassing the physical well-being of residents, the mental
well-being of residents, and the nursing homes operational metrics.  The DHS
and DOH will annually review standards to determine their efficacy in
evaluating health, safety, and operations in nursing homes, as well as the
effectiveness of sanctions, corrective action plans, and other measures used to
respond to a low-performing nursing home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event a nursing home
receives a one-star rating from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) or fails to meet at least two of the DOHs standards in each of
the three categories, the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in
the Department of Human Services (DHS) will be required to take a series of
scaling actions against the nursing home, with the penalties and sanctions
increasing in each additional quarter in which the nursing home has a one-star
CMS rating or fails to meet the DOH standards.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     When evaluating whether to
impose sanctions against a nursing home, the division will be required to
consult with the DOH and review the information concerning the nursing home
that is available on the DOHs nursing home data dashboard.  In the event the
division does not take action against a nursing home, the division will be
required to document the reason why action was not taken.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the division
is to require a nursing home that receives a one-star CMS rating or fails to
meet the DOH standards in any three of the preceding four quarters to submit an
improvement plan.  A nursing home that fails to comply with the requirements
concerning the submission and implementation of an improvement plan will be
ineligible to receive reimbursement under the Medicaid program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies that
nothing in its provisions is to be construed to diminish the authority of the
DHS, DOH, or any other department or agency overseeing nursing homes, and that
actions taken against a nursing home under the bill will be in addition to any
other penalties that may be imposed against the nursing home for health or
safety violations.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The DOH and DHS will be
required to prepare and submit a joint annual report to the Governor and the
Legislature outlining the implementation of the bill and an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the provisions of the bill in fostering improvements in the
health, safety, and quality of care provided in nursing homes.</p>
