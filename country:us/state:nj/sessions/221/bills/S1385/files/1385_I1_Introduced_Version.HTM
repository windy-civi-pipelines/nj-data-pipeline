Attorney General and the State Parole Board shall establish a four-year pilot
program in Ocean County for electronic monitoring of defendants and
notification of domestic violence victims<b> </b>as ordered by the court. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  a. 
Pursuant to the pilot program established by P.L.    , c.    (C.          )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill), electronic monitoring may be
ordered only with the victims informed consent as defined in section 5 of
P.L.    , c.    (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 
The pilot program shall apply to defendants convicted of contempt of a domestic
violence order entered pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1
et al.) or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In making the
determination whether to place the defendant on electronic monitoring, the
court may hold a hearing to consider the likelihood that the defendant's
participation in electronic monitoring will deter the defendant from injuring
the victim<b>. </b>The court shall consider the following factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the gravity and
seriousness of harm that the defendant inflicted on the victim in the
commission of the act of domestic violence;</p>

history of domestic violence, if any; </p>

of other criminal acts, if any;</p>

has access to a weapon; </p>

has threatened suicide or homicide;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   whether the defendant
has a history of mental illness or has been civilly committed; and</p>

monitoring device and tracking system worn or utilized by a defendant pursuant
to P.L.    , c.    (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)
shall be in compliance with Offender Tracking Systems NIJ Standard 1004.00,
issued by the National Institute of Justice in July 2016, and any successor
standards adopted by the National Institute of Justice.</p>

costs and expenses related to electronic monitoring and victim notification or
a portion of the costs and expenses, based on the defendants ability to pay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In addition to the
provisions of subsection d. of this section, a defendant ordered by the court
to be placed on electronic monitoring shall be assessed a monitoring fee of
$250. The court may waive the fee in cases of extreme financial hardship. The
fee shall be collected as provided by the Rules of Court and forwarded to the
Domestic Violence Victim Notification Fund established pursuant to section 7
of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The Attorney General,
in consultation with the Administrative Office of the Courts, shall develop
procedures to determine, investigate, and report on a 24-hour-per-day basis a
defendant's noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the electronic
monitoring program. All reports of noncompliance shall be investigated by a law
enforcement officer within a reasonable period of time.</p>

letter-spacing:0pt'>      This bill establishes a four-year pilot program in
Ocean County for electronic monitoring of certain domestic violence offenders
and notification to victims. The pilot program would be designated as Lisas
Law in remembrance of Letizia Zindell of Toms River, a domestic violence
victim murdered by her former fiancée.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      The pilot program would be ordered only with the
victims informed consent and would apply to defendants convicted of contempt
of a domestic violence order entered pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1981,
c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et al.) or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.). </span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      The bill provides that the court may, in making the
determination whether to place the defendant on electronic monitoring, hold a
hearing to consider the likelihood that the defendant's participation in
electronic monitoring would deter the defendant from injuring the victim. The
court would consider the following factors: the gravity and seriousness of harm
that the defendant inflicted on the victim; the defendants previous history of
domestic violence and other criminal acts, if any; whether the defendant has
access to a weapon; and whether the defendant has threatened suicide or
homicide or has a history of mental illness or substance abuse.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      This
bill requires that any electronic monitoring device and tracking system worn or
utilized by a defendant be in compliance with Offender Tracking Systems NIJ
Standard 1004.00, issued by the National Institute of Justice in July 2016,
and any successor standards adopted by the National Institute of Justice.  The
NIJ Standard encompasses protocols for performance, safety, software
requirements, and testing of electronic monitoring devices. The National
Institute of Justice is the research, development, and evaluation agency of the
United States Department of Justice. </span></p>

be placed on electronic monitoring may be ordered to pay the costs and expenses
related to electronic monitoring and victim notification or a portion of the
costs and expenses, based on the defendants ability to pay. In addition, the
defendant would be assessed a monitoring fee of $250. The court could waive the
fee in cases of extreme financial hardship. The fee would be forwarded to the
Domestic Violence Victim Notification Fund established under the bill. This
fund, a dedicated, non-lapsing fund within the General Fund, would be administered
by the Attorney General. The fund is to be the depository of the costs and
expenses imposed on the defendant and any other monies that may be available to
the fund through appropriation by the Legislature or any public or private
source. All moneys deposited in the fund would be used to defray the costs of the
pilot program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>     The bill requires the victim to be given the following
information before providing informed consent: (1) </span>information
concerning the victim's right to refuse to participate in electronic monitoring
and the process for requesting the court to terminate the victim's
participation after it has been ordered; (2) the manner in which the electronic
monitoring technology functions and the risks and limitations of that
technology, the operational procedures of the device and the applicable
instructions regarding the device, and the extent to which the system will
track and record the victim's location and movements; (3) the boundaries
imposed on the defendant during the electronic monitoring; (4) the sanctions
that the court may impose on the defendant for violating a court order; (5) the
procedure that the victim is to follow if the defendant violates an order or if
the electronic monitoring equipment fails; (6) identification of support
services available to assist the victim in developing a safety plan; (7) identification
of community services available to assist the victim in obtaining shelter,
counseling, child care, legal representation and other assistance; and (8) the
non-confidential nature of the victims communications with the court
concerning electronic monitoring and the restrictions to be imposed upon the
defendants movements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      The bill also provides for
the following civil penalties which would expire at the end of the fifth year
following implementation of the pilot program: (1) any person found by the court
in a final domestic violence hearing to have committed an act of domestic
violence is to be required to pay a civil penalty of $200, similar to the monitoring
fee this penalty may be waived in cases of extreme financial hardship; and (2)
in addition to any other disposition, the court would impose a civil penalty of
$250 on any person convicted of a crime or offense involving domestic violence,
or convicted of contempt of a domestic violence order, unless the person was
previously assessed the $250 monitoring fee.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      The bill further provides
that no supplier of a product, system, or service used for electronic
monitoring with victim notification in the pilot program would be liable,
directly or indirectly, for damages arising from any injury or death associated
with the use of the product, system or service unless, and only to the extent
that, such action is based on a claim that the injury or death was proximately
caused by a manufacturing defect in the product or system.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      The bill also amends the Local
Public Contracts Law, P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.), to provide that
services and equipment necessary for the implementation of the pilot program
could be negotiated and awarded by a governing body without public advertising
for bids and bidding, and be awarded by resolution of the governing body.  </p>

monitoring program.  All reports of noncompliance would be investigated by a
law enforcement officer within a reasonable period of time.</span></p>
