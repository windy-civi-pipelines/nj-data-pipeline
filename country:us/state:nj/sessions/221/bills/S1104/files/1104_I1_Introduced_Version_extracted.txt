A claim of unlawful interference with recording a law enforcement activity is established pursuant to the bills provisions if a person exercised or attempted to exercise the right to record law enforcement activity and a law enforcement officer commits an act that interferes with the person.  Those acts include intentionally preventing or attempting to prevent that person from recording law enforcement activity; threatening the person for recording law enforcement activity; commanding that the person cease recording law enforcement activity when the person was authorized under law to record; stopping, seizing, searching, ticketing, or arresting the person for recording law enforcement activity; or unlawfully seizing property, instruments, or equipment used by the person to record law enforcement activity, unlawfully destroying or seizing a recorded image of law enforcement activity, or copying a recording of law enforcement activity without the consent of the person who recorded it or approval from the court. The bill establishes an affirmative defense under certain circumstances to a civil action if the law enforcement officer had probable cause to arrest the person recording the law enforcement activity for obstructing administration of law or other governmental function. An action for a violation of the bills provisions may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages, including punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and any other remedy the court may deem appropriate.  The court may allow a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorney's and expert fees, in addition to any other costs which may be recovered. This bill is modelled on a recently enacted New York State law that affirms the right to record law enforcement activity and maintain custody of the recording and related equipment.
