Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This act shall be known and may be cited as the Parkinson's Disease Public Awareness and Education Act. 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Parkinsons disease is a debilitating, painful, and incurable neurological disorder of unknown origin that disrupts and can end the lives of those who suffer from it; b.    Parkinsons disease causes diverse symptoms, including rigidity, slowness of movement, poor balance, and tremors, which lead to an impaired ability to walk, speak, swallow, and even breathe, so that the end result can be a clear mind trapped inside a body that has lost its ability to function; c.     The visible symptoms of Parkinsons disease are often mistaken to be a normal part of the aging process; d.    In addition, many people with the disease encounter precarious legal and personal situations in which they are erroneously thought to be under the influence of illegal or prescription drugs or alcohol due to their movement and gait patterns; e.     Parkinsons disease takes an enormous emotional, psychological, and physical toll on caregivers and families, potentially overwhelming their lives; f.     It has been estimated that 1.5 million Americans have been diagnosed with Parkinsons disease, 50,000 more are diagnosed nationally each year, and another 1.5 million persons have the disease but have never seen a neurologist; g.    Parkinsons disease costs Americans $25 billion per year, including medical treatments, disability payments, and lost productivity; h.    Medications can only control some of the symptoms of the disease and only for uncertain periods of time; i.     New Jersey, with the largest concentration of pharmaceutical companies of any state in the nation and its top academic research facilities, is a center for Parkinson's disease research and treatment; j.     The Morris K. Udall Parkinsons Disease Research Act of 1997, Pub.L.105-78, provides federal funding through the National Institutes of Health for Parkinsons disease, and April 11 has been proclaimed to be World Parkinsons Day in order to recognize the need for more research and help in dealing with the devastating effects of this disease;
