<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  The department shall
study the nature and extent of the areas affected by flooding in the State. 
After public hearing upon notice, and pursuant to the &quot;Administrative
Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) <u>and the provisions
of this section</u>, the department <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>shall
adopt<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>

style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>to</u>
delineate as flood hazard areas such areas as, in the judgment of the
department, the improper development and use of which would constitute a threat
to the safety, health, and general welfare from flooding.  These delineations
shall identify the various subportions of the flood hazard area for reasonable
and proper use according to relative risk, including the delineation of
floodways necessary to preserve the flood carrying capacity of natural
streams.  The department shall, within the limits of funds appropriated or
otherwise made available therefor, update delineations of flood hazard areas as
appropriate as provided in subsection b. of this section.  The department shall
update its delineations of flood hazard areas <u>within three months of the
effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature
as this bill), and</u> at least once every 15 years <u>thereafter</u> and shall
prioritize the preparation of updates based upon flood risk.  The department
may, after public hearing upon notice and pursuant to the &quot;Administrative
Procedure Act,&quot; <u>propose to</u> revoke, amend, alter, or modify such <u>rules
and</u> regulations if in its judgment the public interest so warrants <u>subject
to the requirements of this section</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  (1)  <u>(a)</u>  The
department shall wherever practicable, make flood hazard area delineations at
least as protective as the floodplain delineations approved by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency for the National Flood Insurance Program. 
Immediately upon adoption of a floodplain delineation approved by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency for the National Flood Insurance Program <u>prior
to the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill)</u>, the department shall include the
federal floodplain delineation as the department's minimum flood hazard area
delineation for that watercourse, provided that the department has determined
that the federal floodplain delineation is sufficient to carry and discharge
the flood flow of the watercourse and is at least as protective of the public
safety, health, and general welfare as the department's delineation.</p>

effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature
as this bill), the department shall, wherever practicable, delineate flood
hazard areas which are more protective than the floodplain delineations
approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the National Flood
Insurance Program in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph.  Within
three months following the effective date of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

Agency for the National Flood Insurance Program on or prior to the effective
date of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill), and within three months
following each Federal Emergency Management Agency approval of a floodplain delineation
for a watercourse under the National Flood Insurance Program thereafter, the
department shall set the State's flood hazard area delineation for that
watercourse at not more than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation delineated
for that watercourse by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the
National Flood Insurance Program.</u></p>

other provision of law, or rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, to the
contrary<u>, on and after the first day of the fourth month next following the

as this bill)</u>, a person shall apply for a permit or other approval or authorization
issued by the department pursuant to the &quot;Flood Hazard Area Control
Act,&quot; P.L.1962, c.19 (C.58:16A-50 et seq.), for a site based upon a <b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill prohibits the Department
of Environmental Protection (DEP) from implementing or adopting, prior to June
1, 2038, the rules and regulations proposed by the DEP and published in the New
Jersey Register on August 5, 2024, which are known as New Jerseys Protecting
Against Climate Threats (NJPACT) Rules.  The bill also prohibits the DEP from
implementing or adopting a rule or regulation that is substantially similar to
one or more provisions set forth in the NJPACT rule proposal, unless, prior to
that date, the Legislature has passed a concurrent resolution authorizing the DEP
to adopt those rules and regulations.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill limits
the DEPs current discretion over the delineation of the State's flood hazard
areas by requiring the DEP to set the State's flood hazard area delineation for
each watercourse at no more than one foot above the 100-year flood elevation
delineated for that watercourse by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  Current law requires the
DEP to make flood hazard area delineations at least as protective as floodplain
delineations approved by the FEMA for the NFIP.  This bill would not change
that requirement, but would remove the unlimited discretion current law affords
the DEP in determining the height of a flood hazard area. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
requires the DEP, within three months following the bills effective date, to
set the State's flood hazard area delineation for each watercourse at one foot
above the 100-year flood elevation delineated for that watercourse by the
FEMA.  The bill also requires the DEP, within three months following each
subsequent FEMA delineation of a floodplain for a watercourse, to set the
State's flood hazard area delineation for that watercourse at one foot above
the 100-year flood elevation delineated for that watercourse by the FEMA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
person applying to the DEP for a permit or other approval, pursuant to the
&quot;Flood Hazard Area Control Act,&quot; P.L.1962, c.19 (C.58:16A-50 et seq.)
on and after the first day of the fourth month next following the bills
effective date, would be subject to the State's flood hazard area delineation
of one foot above the FEMAs delineation of the 100-year flood elevation for
that watercourse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
after the bills effective date, the DEP may not adopt a rule or regulation
relevant to delineating an area as a flood hazard area unless the DEP first
submits the proposed rule or regulation to the Legislature, and the Legislature
passes a concurrent resolution authorizing the DEP to adopt the rule or
regulation.  The bill requires the DEP to submit to the Legislature each rule
or regulation it proposes to delineate an area as a flood hazard area, and
prohibits the DEP from adopting a proposed rule or regulation unless the
Legislature passes a concurrent resolution specifically approving the proposed
rule or regulation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill is introduced in
response to the DEPs recently proposed NJPACT Rules.  The proposed NJPACT
Rules, in relevant part, propose to establish a &quot;climate-adjusted flood
elevation&quot; of five feet above the FEMA 100-year flood elevation for each
New Jersey watercourse.  The DEPs justification for proposing the rule is to
adjust flood-hazard development thresholds to take into account projected sea
level rise due to climate change.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The adoption of the DEPs
proposed NJPACT rules would be detrimental to New Jersey, and particularly to
our States coastal communities.  The DEP has failed to conduct a proper
cost-benefit analysis to justify adoption of the proposed rules.  The adoption
of the rule proposal would cause large portions of New Jerseys coastal area as
being improper for development and use.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The DEPs assertions that
development of these areas would constitute a threat to the safety, health, and
general welfare from flooding due to projected climate change are not
accurate.  The DEP used an outdated and flawed 2019 Rutgers report to justify
its proposed establishment of a &quot;climate-adjusted flood elevation&quot; of
five feet above the FEMA 100-year flood elevation.  Rather than protect the
general welfare, adoption of the rule proposal would significantly harm the
general welfare, which the DEP is responsible to protect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Adoption of the DEPs rule
proposal would limit the ability of middle- and lower-income families to own,
improve, or restore coastal properties, and thereby incentivize many of those
families to sell their coastal properties to the wealthy or to the government. 
Adoption of this bill would set a standard delineation mechanism in State law,
and thereby prevent the DEP from setting the State's flood hazard area
delineation at more than one foot above the FEMA-delineated 100-year flood
elevation.</p>
