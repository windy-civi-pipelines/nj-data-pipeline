CRYAN District 20 (Union) SYNOPSIS Pet Insurance Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning pet insurance and supplementing P.L.1987, c.377 (C.17:46D-1 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This act shall be known and may be cited as the Pet Insurance Act. 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The purpose of this act is to promote the public welfare by creating a comprehensive legal framework within which pet insurance may be sold in this State. b.    The requirements of this act shall apply to pet insurance policies that are issued to any resident of this State, and are sold, solicited, negotiated, or offered in this State, and policies or certificates that are delivered or issued for delivery in this State. c.     All other applicable provisions of this States insurance laws shall continue to apply to pet insurance except that the specific provisions of this act shall supersede any general provisions of law that would otherwise be applicable to pet insurance. 3.    As used in this act: Chronic condition means a condition that can be treated or managed, but not cured. Congenital anomaly or disorder means a condition that is present from birth, whether inherited or caused by the environment, which may cause or contribute to illness or disease. Department means the Department of Banking and Insurance. Hereditary disorder means an abnormality that is genetically transmitted from parent to offspring and may cause illness or disease. Insured means the owner of the pet listed in the policy. Orthopedic refers to conditions affecting the bones, skeletal muscle, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and joints. It includes, but is not limited to, elbow dysplasia, hip dysplasia, intervertebral disc degeneration, patellar luxation, and ruptured cranial cruciate ligaments. It does not include cancers or metabolic, hemopoietic, or autoimmune diseases. "Pet" means a member of the kingdom of living beings, commonly known as a domestic animal, that has the capacity for spontaneous movement and rapid motor response to stimulation, yet is not human, and which has been adapted or tamed to live in intimate association with, and for the pleasure or advantage of, the human species. Pet insurance means a property insurance policy that provides coverage for accidents and illnesses of pets. Preexisting condition means any condition for which any of the following are true prior to the effective date of a pet insurance policy or during any waiting period: (1)   A veterinarian provided medical advice; (2)   The pet received previous treatment; or (3)   Based on information from verifiable sources, the pet had signs or symptoms directly related to the condition for which a claim is being made. A condition for which coverage is afforded on a policy cannot be considered a preexisting condition on any renewal of the policy. Renewal means to issue and deliver at the end of an insurance policy period a policy which supersedes a policy previously issued and delivered by the same pet insurer or affiliated pet insurer and which provides types and limits of coverage substantially similar to those contained in the policy being superseded. Veterinarian means an individual who holds a valid license to practice veterinary medicine pursuant to P.L.1938, c.277 (C.45:16-1 et seq.). Veterinary expenses means the costs associated with medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment provided by a veterinarian, including, but not limited to, the cost of drugs prescribed by a veterinarian. Waiting period means the period of time specified in a pet insurance policy that is required to transpire before some or all of the coverage in the policy can begin. Waiting periods shall not be applied to renewals of existing coverage. Wellness program means a subscription or reimbursement-based program that is separate from an insurance policy that provides goods and services to promote the general health, safety, or well-being of the pet.  If any wellness program undertakes to indemnify another, or provides coverage for a fortuitous event, it is transacting in the business of insurance and is subject to the insurance code. This definition is not intended to classify a contract directly between a service provider and a pet owner that only involves the two parties as being the business of insurance, unless other indications of insurance also exist. 4.    a.  If a pet insurer uses any of the terms in section 3 of this act in a policy of pet insurance, the pet insurer shall use the definition of each of those terms as set forth herein and include the definition of the term in the policy. The pet insurer shall also make the definition available through a clear and conspicuous link on the main page of the internet website of the pet insurer or pet insurers program administrator. b.    Nothing in this act shall in any way prohibit or limit the types of exclusions pet insurers may use in their policies or require pet insurers to have any of the limitations or exclusions defined in section 3 of this act. 5.    a.  A pet insurer transacting pet insurance shall disclose to insureds: (1)   if the policy excludes coverage due to: (a)   a preexisting condition; (b)   a hereditary disorder; (c)   a congenital anomaly or disorder; or (d)   a chronic condition; (2)   if the policy includes any other exclusions, using the following statement: Other exclusions may apply.

(2)   Pet insurance policies, certificates and riders shall have a notice prominently printed on the first page, or attached thereto, including specific instructions to accomplish a return. The following free look statement or language substantially similar shall be included: YOU HAVE 30 DAYS FROM THE DAY YOU RECEIVE THIS POLICY, CERTIFICATE OR RIDER TO REVIEW IT AND RETURN IT TO THE COMPANY IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO KEEP IT. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TELL THE COMPANY WHY YOU ARE RETURNING IT. IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO KEEP IT, SIMPLY RETURN IT TO THE COMPANY AT ITS ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OR YOU MAY RETURN IT TO THE AGENT OR INSURANCE PRODUCER THAT YOU BOUGHT IT FROM AS LONG AS YOU HAVE NOT FILED A CLAIM. YOU MUST RETURN IT WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DAY YOU FIRST RECEIVED IT. THE COMPANY WILL REFUND THE FULL AMOUNT OF ANY PREMIUM PAID WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER IT RECEIVES THE RETURNED POLICY, CERTIFICATE, OR RIDER.

Waiting periods for accidents are prohibited.

This act shall take effect on the first day of the 12th month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill establishes the Pet Insurance Act, which creates a comprehensive legal framework within which pet insurance may be sold in the State. Under the bill, several consumer protections related to policy renewals, waiting periods, policy limits, conditions, and benefit schedules are included, including disclosures a pet insurer transacting pet insurance must disclose to consumers, such as: (1)   if the policy excludes coverage due to: (a)   a preexisting condition; (b)   a hereditary disorder; (c)   a congenital anomaly or disorder; or (d)   a chronic condition; and (2)   if the policy includes any other exclusions, using the following statement: Other exclusions may apply.  Please refer to the exclusions section of the policy for more information. The bill provides limits on how insurers can deny pet insurance claims related to preexisting conditions of covered pets, and requires the insurer to prove a preexisting condition limitation applies. The bill additionally provides requirements to insurers and insurance producers to clearly differentiate pet wellness programs from insurance policies to eliminate consumer confusion between what services are covered by insurance. Finally, the bill provides training requirements for insurance producers to ensure that producers are appropriately prepared to present information to consumers.
