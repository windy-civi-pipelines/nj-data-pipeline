(cf: P.L.2021, c.175, s.2) 3.  Section 2 of P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.31) is amended to read as follows: 2.  [All] Under P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.30 et seq.), all exemptions from taxation [under P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.30 et seq.)], or exemptions from the payment of a payment in lieu of property taxes required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.) shall be allowed by the assessor upon the filing with him of a claim in writing under oath, made by or on behalf of the person claiming the same, showing the right to the exemption, briefly describing the property for which exemption is claimed and having annexed thereto a certificate of the claimant's honorable discharge or release under honorable circumstances, from active service in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States and a certificate from the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs or its successor, certifying to a service-connected disability of such claimant of the character described in section 1 of P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.30).  In the case of a claim by a surviving spouse of such veteran, the claimant shall establish in writing under oath that the claimant is the owner of the legal title to the premises on which exemption is claimed; that the claimant occupies the dwelling house on said premises as the claimant's legal residence in this State; that the veteran shall have been declared, either during the veteran's lifetime or after the veteran's death, by the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs to have or to have had a service-connected disability of a character described in this act, or, in the case of a claim for an exemption under subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.30), that the veteran shall have been declared to have died in active service; that the veteran was entitled to an exemption provided for in this act, except for an exemption under paragraph (2) of subsection b. and subsection c. of section 1 hereof, at the time of death; and that the claimant is a resident of this State and has not remarried.  Such exemptions shall be allowed and prorated by the assessor for the remainder of any taxable year from the date the claimant shall have acquired title to the real property intended to be exempt by this act.  Where a portion of a multiple-family building or structure occupied by the claimant is the subject of such exemption, the assessor shall aggregate the assessment on the lot or curtilage and building or structure and allow an exemption of that percentage of the aggregate assessment as the value of the portion of the building or structure occupied by the claimant bears to the value of the entire building or structure. (cf: P.L.2019, c.413, s.2) 4.  Section 3 of P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.32) is amended to read as follows: 3.    The governing body of each municipality, by appropriate resolution, may return all property taxes, or payments in lieu of property taxes required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), that were collected on property which would have been exempt had proper claim in writing been made therefor in the manner provided by P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.30 et seq.). The governing body of each municipality, by appropriate resolution, may also return to the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse all property tax payments, or payments in lieu of property taxes required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), that were made since the time of the veteran's actual disability or since the time of the veteran's death.

(cf: P.L.1989, c.252, s.2) 10.  Section 4 of P.L.1976, c.129 (C.54:4-8.41a) is amended to read as follows: 4.  The surviving spouse of a deceased citizen and resident of this State who during his or her life received a real property tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the person as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.),  pursuant to this act shall be entitled, so long as he or she shall remain unmarried and a resident in the same dwelling house with respect to which said deduction was granted, to the same deduction, upon the same conditions, with respect to the same real property, notwithstanding that said surviving spouse is under the age of 65 and is not permanently and totally disabled, provided that said surviving spouse is 55 years of age or older at the time of the death of said citizen and resident.

Upon approval of the application for a tax deduction or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), the tax collector shall note in his records the existence of a contingent liability for taxes or payments in lieu of property taxes in the amount of the deduction in the event the deduction is subsequently disallowed on the basis of the taxpayer's income, the transfer of title to the property to a person not entitled to such deduction, or on the basis of the failure to meet any other prerequisites required by this act for a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), which contingent liability shall be reported on any tax search made on the property for which the deduction was approved. The application, if not filed with the assessor within the time aforementioned, may be filed with the collector during the tax year and upon approval by the collector of such application he shall determine the amount of the reduction in tax or in payment in lieu of property taxes to which the claimant is entitled and shall allow said amount as an offset against the tax, or payment in lieu of property taxes, then remaining unpaid.  If the amount allowable as an offset shall exceed the amount of the tax, or payment in lieu of property taxes, then unpaid for that tax year, or if the application for a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), is not filed with the collector until after all taxes, or payments in lieu of property taxes, for the tax year have been fully paid, the claimant may make application to the governing body of the municipality constituting the taxing district for the refund of any tax overpaid, but without interest, and the governing body may, in its discretion, direct the return of any tax, or payment in lieu of property taxes, deemed by it to have been overpaid by reason of claimant's failure to make timely application for a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.); provided, however, that no application for a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), for any previous tax year shall be allowed by any assessor, collector or governing body.  Where an application for a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), is filed with and allowed by a collector he shall promptly transmit such application and all exhibits attached thereto, or a photostatic copy thereof, to the assessor of the taxing district.  Upon receipt thereof the assessor shall review the application and if approved by him it shall have the same force as if originally filed with him. (cf: P.L.1976, c.129, s.6) 12.  Section 5 of P.L.1964, c.255 (C.54:4-8.44a) is amended to read as follows: 5.  Every person who is allowed a deduction shall, except as hereinafter provided, be required to file with the collector of the taxing district on or before March 1 of the post-tax year a statement under oath of his income for the tax year and his anticipated income for the ensuing tax year as well as any other information deemed necessary to establish his right to a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), for such ensuing tax year.  The collector may grant a reasonable extension of time for filing the statement required by this section, which extension shall terminate no later than May 1 of the post-tax year, in any event where it shall appear to the satisfaction of the collector, verified by a physician's certificate, that the failure to file by March 1 was due to illness or a medical problem which prevented timely filing of the statement. In any case where such an extension is granted by the collector, the required statement shall be filed on or before May 1 of the post-tax year. Such statement shall be on a form prescribed by the Director of the Division of Taxation, in the Department of the Treasury and provided for the use of persons required to make such statement by the governing body of the municipality constituting the taxing district in which such statement is required to be filed and shall be mailed by the collector on or before February 1 of the post-tax year to each person within the taxing district who was allowed a deduction in the preceding year. Each collector may require the submission of such proof as he shall deem necessary to verify any such statement.  Upon the failure of any such person to file the statement within time herein provided or to submit such proof as the collector deems necessary to verify a statement that has been filed, or if it is determined that the income of any such person exceeded the applicable income limitation for said tax year, his tax deduction for said tax year shall be disallowed.  A notice of disallowance, on a form prescribed by the director, shall be mailed to that person by the collector on or before April 1 of the post-tax year or, where an extension of time for filing has been granted, no later than June 1, and his taxes, or payments in lieu of property taxes, to the extent represented by the amount of said deduction shall be payable on or before June 1 of the post-tax year or, where an extension of time for filing has been granted no later than 30 calendar days after the notice of disallowance was mailed, after which date if unpaid, said taxes shall be delinquent, constitute a lien on the property, and, in addition, the amount of said taxes shall be a personal debt of said person. The amount of any lien and tax liability, or the amount of any lien and liability for payments in lieu of property taxes, shall be prorated by the tax collector upon the transfer of title based on the number of days during the tax year that entitlement to the tax deduction is established.  The lien shall be considered satisfied by the tax collector upon payment of the prorated amount for that portion of the tax year for which entitlement to the tax deduction is not established. (cf: P.L.1997, c.30, s.3) 13.  Section 7 of P.L.1963, c.172 (C.54:4-8.46) is amended to read as follows: 7.  Where title to property as to which a deduction is claimed is held by claimant and another or others, either as tenants in common or as joint tenants, claimant shall not be allowed a deduction in an amount in excess of his proportionate share of the taxes assessed against said property, or from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), which proportionate share, for the purposes of this act, shall be deemed to be equal to that of each of the other tenants, unless it is shown that the interests in question are not equal, in which event claimant's proportionate share shall be as shown.  Nothing herein shall preclude more than one tenant, whether title be held in common or joint tenancy, from claiming a deduction from the taxes assessed against the property so held, , or from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), but no more than the equivalent of one full deduction in regard to such property shall be allowed in any year, and in any case in which the claimants cannot agree as to the apportionment thereof, such deduction shall be apportioned between or among them in proportion to their interest.  Property held by husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety, shall be deemed wholly owned by each tenant, but no more than one deduction in regard to such property shall be allowed in any year.  Right to claim a deduction hereunder shall extend to property the title to which is held by a partnership, to the extent of the claimant's interest as a partner therein, and by a guardian, trustee, committee, conservator or other fiduciary for any person who would otherwise be entitled to claim such deduction hereunder, but not to property the title to which is held by a corporation; except that a residential shareholder in a cooperative or mutual housing corporation shall be entitled to claim a deduction he is otherwise eligible to receive, to the extent of the proportionate share of the taxes assessed against the real property of the corporation, or any other entity holding title, attributable to his unit therein, or from payments in lieu of property taxes as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), attributable to the residential shareholders unit therein. (cf: P.L.1989, c.252, s.4) 14.  This act shall take effect immediately but shall remain inoperative until the approval by the voters of the State, at a general election, an amendment to the New Jersey Constitution authorizing the property tax benefits provided herein to veterans, seniors, and persons with disabilities who pay payments in lieu of property taxes instead of property taxes. STATEMENT This bill would extend eligibility for the property tax exemption provided to veterans who have suffered a 100 percent service-connected disability, the $250 veterans property tax deduction, and the $250 property tax deduction for senior citizens and persons with disabilities to those persons who pay payments in lieu of property taxes, as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), instead of property taxes, on their homes.

The application, if not filed with the assessor within the time aforementioned, may be filed with the collector during the tax year and upon approval by the collector of such application he shall determine the amount of the reduction in tax or in payment in lieu of property taxes to which the claimant is entitled and shall allow said amount as an offset against the tax, or payment in lieu of property taxes, then remaining unpaid.  If the amount allowable as an offset shall exceed the amount of the tax, or payment in lieu of property taxes, then unpaid for that tax year, or if the application for a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), is not filed with the collector until after all taxes, or payments in lieu of property taxes, for the tax year have been fully paid, the claimant may make application to the governing body of the municipality constituting the taxing district for the refund of any tax overpaid, but without interest, and the governing body may, in its discretion, direct the return of any tax, or payment in lieu of property taxes, deemed by it to have been overpaid by reason of claimant's failure to make timely application for a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.); provided, however, that no application for a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), for any previous tax year shall be allowed by any assessor, collector or governing body.  Where an application for a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), is filed with and allowed by a collector he shall promptly transmit such application and all exhibits attached thereto, or a photostatic copy thereof, to the assessor of the taxing district.  Upon receipt thereof the assessor shall review the application and if approved by him it shall have the same force as if originally filed with him. (cf: P.L.1976, c.129, s.6) 12.  Section 5 of P.L.1964, c.255 (C.54:4-8.44a) is amended to read as follows: 5.  Every person who is allowed a deduction shall, except as hereinafter provided, be required to file with the collector of the taxing district on or before March 1 of the post-tax year a statement under oath of his income for the tax year and his anticipated income for the ensuing tax year as well as any other information deemed necessary to establish his right to a tax deduction, or a deduction from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), for such ensuing tax year.  The collector may grant a reasonable extension of time for filing the statement required by this section, which extension shall terminate no later than May 1 of the post-tax year, in any event where it shall appear to the satisfaction of the collector, verified by a physician's certificate, that the failure to file by March 1 was due to illness or a medical problem which prevented timely filing of the statement. In any case where such an extension is granted by the collector, the required statement shall be filed on or before May 1 of the post-tax year. Such statement shall be on a form prescribed by the Director of the Division of Taxation, in the Department of the Treasury and provided for the use of persons required to make such statement by the governing body of the municipality constituting the taxing district in which such statement is required to be filed and shall be mailed by the collector on or before February 1 of the post-tax year to each person within the taxing district who was allowed a deduction in the preceding year. Each collector may require the submission of such proof as he shall deem necessary to verify any such statement.  Upon the failure of any such person to file the statement within time herein provided or to submit such proof as the collector deems necessary to verify a statement that has been filed, or if it is determined that the income of any such person exceeded the applicable income limitation for said tax year, his tax deduction for said tax year shall be disallowed.  A notice of disallowance, on a form prescribed by the director, shall be mailed to that person by the collector on or before April 1 of the post-tax year or, where an extension of time for filing has been granted, no later than June 1, and his taxes, or payments in lieu of property taxes, to the extent represented by the amount of said deduction shall be payable on or before June 1 of the post-tax year or, where an extension of time for filing has been granted no later than 30 calendar days after the notice of disallowance was mailed, after which date if unpaid, said taxes shall be delinquent, constitute a lien on the property, and, in addition, the amount of said taxes shall be a personal debt of said person. The amount of any lien and tax liability, or the amount of any lien and liability for payments in lieu of property taxes, shall be prorated by the tax collector upon the transfer of title based on the number of days during the tax year that entitlement to the tax deduction is established.  The lien shall be considered satisfied by the tax collector upon payment of the prorated amount for that portion of the tax year for which entitlement to the tax deduction is not established. (cf: P.L.1997, c.30, s.3) 13.  Section 7 of P.L.1963, c.172 (C.54:4-8.46) is amended to read as follows: 7.  Where title to property as to which a deduction is claimed is held by claimant and another or others, either as tenants in common or as joint tenants, claimant shall not be allowed a deduction in an amount in excess of his proportionate share of the taxes assessed against said property, or from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), which proportionate share, for the purposes of this act, shall be deemed to be equal to that of each of the other tenants, unless it is shown that the interests in question are not equal, in which event claimant's proportionate share shall be as shown.  Nothing herein shall preclude more than one tenant, whether title be held in common or joint tenancy, from claiming a deduction from the taxes assessed against the property so held, , or from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), but no more than the equivalent of one full deduction in regard to such property shall be allowed in any year, and in any case in which the claimants cannot agree as to the apportionment thereof, such deduction shall be apportioned between or among them in proportion to their interest.  Property held by husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety, shall be deemed wholly owned by each tenant, but no more than one deduction in regard to such property shall be allowed in any year.  Right to claim a deduction hereunder shall extend to property the title to which is held by a partnership, to the extent of the claimant's interest as a partner therein, and by a guardian, trustee, committee, conservator or other fiduciary for any person who would otherwise be entitled to claim such deduction hereunder, but not to property the title to which is held by a corporation; except that a residential shareholder in a cooperative or mutual housing corporation shall be entitled to claim a deduction he is otherwise eligible to receive, to the extent of the proportionate share of the taxes assessed against the real property of the corporation, or any other entity holding title, attributable to his unit therein, or from payments in lieu of property taxes as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), attributable to the residential shareholders unit therein. (cf: P.L.1989, c.252, s.4) 14.  This act shall take effect immediately but shall remain inoperative until the approval by the voters of the State, at a general election, an amendment to the New Jersey Constitution authorizing the property tax benefits provided herein to veterans, seniors, and persons with disabilities who pay payments in lieu of property taxes instead of property taxes. STATEMENT This bill would extend eligibility for the property tax exemption provided to veterans who have suffered a 100 percent service-connected disability, the $250 veterans property tax deduction, and the $250 property tax deduction for senior citizens and persons with disabilities to those persons who pay payments in lieu of property taxes, as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), instead of property taxes, on their homes.
