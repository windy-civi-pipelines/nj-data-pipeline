with the collector of the taxing district on or before March 1 of the post-tax
year a statement under oath of his income for the tax year and his anticipated
income for the ensuing tax year as well as any other information deemed
necessary to establish his right to a tax deduction<u>, or a deduction from
payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required pursuant to
a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the
Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.),</u> for
such ensuing tax year.  The collector may grant a reasonable extension of time
for filing the statement required by this section, which extension shall
terminate no later than May 1 of the post-tax year, in any event where it shall
appear to the satisfaction of the collector, verified by a physician's
certificate, that the failure to file by March 1 was due to illness or a
medical problem which prevented timely filing of the statement. In any case
where such an extension is granted by the collector, the required statement
shall be filed on or before May 1 of the post-tax year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Such statement shall be on a
form prescribed by the Director of the Division of Taxation, in the Department
of the Treasury and provided for the use of persons required to make such
statement by the governing body of the municipality constituting the taxing
district in which such statement is required to be filed and shall be mailed by
the collector on or before February 1 of the post-tax year to each person
within the taxing district who was allowed a deduction in the preceding year. 
Each collector may require the submission of such proof as he shall deem
necessary to verify any such statement.  Upon the failure of any such person to
file the statement within time herein provided or to submit such proof as the
collector deems necessary to verify a statement that has been filed, or if it
is determined that the income of any such person exceeded the applicable income
limitation for said tax year, his tax deduction for said tax year shall be
disallowed.  A notice of disallowance, on a form prescribed by the director,
shall be mailed to that person by the collector on or before April 1 of the
post-tax year or, where an extension of time for filing has been granted, no
later than June 1, and his taxes<u>, or payments in lieu of property taxes,</u>
to the extent represented by the amount of said deduction shall be payable on
or before June 1 of the post-tax year or, where an extension of time for filing
has been granted no later than 30 calendar days after the notice of
disallowance was mailed, after which date if unpaid, said taxes shall be
delinquent, constitute a lien on the property, and, in addition, the amount of
said taxes shall be a personal debt of said person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The amount of any lien and tax
liability<u>, or the amount of any lien and liability for payments in lieu of
property taxes,</u> shall be prorated by the tax collector upon the transfer of
title based on the number of days during the tax year that entitlement to the
tax deduction is established.  The lien shall be considered satisfied by the
tax collector upon payment of the prorated amount for that portion of the tax
year for which entitlement to the tax deduction is not established.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     13.  Section 7 of P.L.1963,
c.172 (C.54:4-8.46) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.  Where title to property as
to which a deduction is claimed is held by claimant and another or others,
either as tenants in common or as joint tenants, claimant shall not be allowed
a deduction in an amount in excess of his proportionate share of the taxes
assessed against said property<u>, or from payments in lieu of property taxes made
by the claimant as required pursuant to a contract between a municipality and
an urban renewal entity pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991,
c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.),</u> which proportionate share, for the purposes of
this act, shall be deemed to be equal to that of each of the other tenants,
unless it is shown that the interests in question are not equal, in which event
claimant's proportionate share shall be as shown.  Nothing herein shall preclude
more than one tenant, whether title be held in common or joint tenancy, from
claiming a deduction from the taxes assessed against the property so held, <u>,
or from payments in lieu of property taxes made by the claimant as required
pursuant to a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity
pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et
al.),</u> but no more than the equivalent of one full deduction in regard to
such property shall be allowed in any year, and in any case in which the
claimants cannot agree as to the apportionment thereof, such deduction shall be
apportioned between or among them in proportion to their interest.  Property
held by husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety, shall be deemed wholly
owned by each tenant, but no more than one deduction in regard to such property
shall be allowed in any year.  Right to claim a deduction hereunder shall
extend to property the title to which is held by a partnership, to the extent
of the claimant's interest as a partner therein, and by a guardian, trustee,
committee, conservator or other fiduciary for any person who would otherwise be
entitled to claim such deduction hereunder, but not to property the title to
which is held by a corporation; except that a residential shareholder in a
cooperative or mutual housing corporation shall be entitled to claim a
deduction he is otherwise eligible to receive, to the extent of the
proportionate share of the taxes assessed against the real property of the
corporation, or any other entity holding title, attributable to his unit
therein<u>, or from payments in lieu of property taxes as required pursuant to
a contract between a municipality and an urban renewal entity pursuant to the
Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.),
attributable to the residential shareholders unit therein</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     14.  This act shall take
effect immediately but shall remain inoperative until the approval by the
