The municipality shall not utilize any other redevelopment powers within the urban enterprise zone unless the municipal governing body and planning board have also taken the actions and fulfilled the requirements prescribed in P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.) for determining that the area is in need of redevelopment or an area in need of rehabilitation and the municipal governing body has adopted a redevelopment plan ordinance including the area of the enterprise zone. h.    [The designation of the delineated area is consistent with smart growth planning principles adopted pursuant to law or regulation.]  (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (cf: P.L.2019, c.229, s.1) 3.  Section 28 of P.L. 1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-28) is amended to read as follows: 28.  No ordinance, amendment or revision of an ordinance, or resolution under [this act] P.L. 1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.) shall be submitted to or adopted by initiative or binding referendum [, notwithstanding any other] .  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a municipal governing body may submit a nonbinding referendum to ascertain the sentiment of the voters on a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance. (cf: P.L.1992, c.79, s.28) 4.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend provisions of the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq., hereinafter, the LRHL) to clarify the statutory criteria for determining when an area is in need of redevelopment.  To that end, the bill would add a definition for the term detrimental to the safety, health, or welfare of the community to mean objective evidence of detriment, including, but not limited to, substantial building or health code violations, excessive police activity, a lack of structural integrity, or a continuing exterior appearance that detracts from the community or surrounding properties, in each case, which is proven to be more costly to restore than to replace.  The bill specifies that, with regard to commercial property, objective evidence of detriment may also include a lack of proper utilization of the land or structures that leads to substantial economic stagnation or unproductive condition of the land. Additionally, the bill would delete from the definition of the term redevelopment area in the LRHL, language that currently allows a redevelopment area to contain lands, buildings, or improvements which of themselves are not detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare if their inclusion is found to be necessary for the effective redevelopment of the area. The bill would also require a municipal governing body to determine that an area is in need of redevelopment by adoption of an ordinance rather than a resolution.  The bill proposes various changes to section 5 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-5) to clarify the statutes criteria for determining when an area is in need of redevelopment. In this regard, the bill proposes deleting: certain criteria from the statute allowing designation on a finding (concerning the generality of buildings being substandard, unsafe, unsanitary, dilapidated, or obsolescent, or possess any of such characteristics, or are so lacking in light, air, or space, as to be conducive to unwholesome living or working conditions); and certain criteria from the statute which authorizes the designation of a redevelopment area if doing so is consistent with smart growth planning principles. Finally, the bill would amend the LRHL to authorize a municipal governing body to submit a nonbinding referendum to ascertain the sentiment of the voters on a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance.

(cf: P.L.1992, c.79, s.28) 4.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend provisions of the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq., hereinafter, the LRHL) to clarify the statutory criteria for determining when an area is in need of redevelopment.  To that end, the bill would add a definition for the term detrimental to the safety, health, or welfare of the community to mean objective evidence of detriment, including, but not limited to, substantial building or health code violations, excessive police activity, a lack of structural integrity, or a continuing exterior appearance that detracts from the community or surrounding properties, in each case, which is proven to be more costly to restore than to replace.  The bill specifies that, with regard to commercial property, objective evidence of detriment may also include a lack of proper utilization of the land or structures that leads to substantial economic stagnation or unproductive condition of the land. Additionally, the bill would delete from the definition of the term redevelopment area in the LRHL, language that currently allows a redevelopment area to contain lands, buildings, or improvements which of themselves are not detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare if their inclusion is found to be necessary for the effective redevelopment of the area. The bill would also require a municipal governing body to determine that an area is in need of redevelopment by adoption of an ordinance rather than a resolution.  The bill proposes various changes to section 5 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-5) to clarify the statutes criteria for determining when an area is in need of redevelopment. In this regard, the bill proposes deleting: certain criteria from the statute allowing designation on a finding (concerning the generality of buildings being substandard, unsafe, unsanitary, dilapidated, or obsolescent, or possess any of such characteristics, or are so lacking in light, air, or space, as to be conducive to unwholesome living or working conditions); and certain criteria from the statute which authorizes the designation of a redevelopment area if doing so is consistent with smart growth planning principles. Finally, the bill would amend the LRHL to authorize a municipal governing body to submit a nonbinding referendum to ascertain the sentiment of the voters on a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance.
