<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend
provisions of the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, P.L.1992, c.79
(C.40A:12A-1 et seq., hereinafter, the LRHL) to clarify the statutory criteria
for determining when an area is in need of redevelopment.  To that end, the
bill would add a definition for the term detrimental to the safety, health, or
welfare of the community to mean objective evidence of detriment, including,
but not limited to, substantial building or health code violations, excessive
police activity, a lack of structural integrity, or a continuing exterior
appearance that detracts from the community or surrounding properties, in each
case, which is proven to be more costly to restore than to replace.  The bill
specifies that, with regard to commercial property, objective evidence of
detriment may also include a lack of proper utilization of the land or
structures that leads to substantial economic stagnation or unproductive
condition of the land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill would
delete from the definition of the term redevelopment area in the LRHL,
language that currently allows a redevelopment area to contain lands,
buildings, or improvements which of themselves are not detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare if their inclusion is found to be necessary
for the effective redevelopment of the area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also require a
municipal governing body to determine that an area is in need of redevelopment
by adoption of an ordinance rather than a resolution.  The bill proposes
various changes to section 5 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-5) to clarify the
statutes criteria for determining when an area is in need of redevelopment. 
In this regard, the bill proposes deleting: certain criteria from the statute
allowing designation on a finding (concerning the generality of buildings being
substandard, unsafe, unsanitary, dilapidated, or obsolescent, or possess any of
such characteristics, or are so lacking in light, air, or space, as to be
conducive to unwholesome living or working conditions); and certain criteria
from the statute which authorizes the designation of a redevelopment area if
doing so is consistent with smart growth planning principles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would amend
the LRHL to authorize a municipal governing body to submit a nonbinding
referendum to ascertain the sentiment of the voters on a proposed amendment to
the zoning ordinance.</p>
