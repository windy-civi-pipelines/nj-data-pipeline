A gross income taxpayer who is an employer or a business subject to the CBT may receive a tax credit equal to any payments made on behalf of a qualified employee who graduated from an accredited institution of higher education and was employed in New Jersey during the tax year.  The GIT credit for a taxpayer who is an employer and the CBT credit are equal to the monthly loan payment made by the employer multiplied by the number of loan payments made by a taxpayer on behalf of a qualified employee during a taxable year or privilege period.  The credit is reduced to 50 percent if a qualified employee is employed on a part-time basis. The bill defines a qualified employee as a resident taxpayer who (1) obtained an associates degree or a bachelors degree from an accredited institution of higher education or a graduate degree from an accredited institution of higher education who was employed in this State during the privilege period; and (2) was employed in New Jersey on a full-time or part-time basis by an employer, was a self-employed individual, or was an active duty member of the United States Armed Forces, New Jersey National Guard, or the Reserve Component of the United States Armed Forces.
