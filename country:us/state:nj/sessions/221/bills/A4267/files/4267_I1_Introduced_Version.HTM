<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides  for a
specific civil action by a disabled minor or disabled adult for injury
resulting from abuse, neglect, exploitation, or bullying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bills definition of
disability is the same as the definition set forth in the Law Against
Discrimination, P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.): physical or sensory
disability, infirmity, malformation, or disfigurement which is caused by bodily
injury, birth defect, or illness including epilepsy and other seizure
disorders, and which shall include, but not be limited to, any degree of
paralysis, amputation, lack of physical coordination, blindness or visual
impairment, deafness or hearing impairment, muteness or speech impairment, or
physical reliance on a service or guide dog, wheelchair, or other remedial
appliance or device, or any mental, psychological, or developmental disability,
including autism spectrum disorders, resulting from anatomical, psychological,
physiological, or neurological conditions which prevents the typical exercise
of any bodily or mental functions or is demonstrable, medically or
psychologically, by accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques. 
Disability shall also mean AIDS or HIV infection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, every civil
action for an injury to a minor with a disability under the age of 18 where
such injury resulted from abuse, neglect, exploitation, or bullying and the
injury occurred prior to, on, or after the effective date of the bill would be
required to be commenced within 37 years after the minor reaches the age of majority,
or within seven years from the date of reasonable discovery of the injury and
its causal relationship to the act, whichever is later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that every
civil action for an injury to an adult with a disability aged 18 or older where
such injury resulted from abuse, neglect, exploitation, or bullying that
occurred prior to, on, or after the effective date of the bill would be
required to be commenced within seven years from the date of reasonable
discovery of the injury and its causal relationship to the act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
the bullying of a vulnerable adult may constitute grounds for an investigation
by adult protective services and a report to law enforcement for possible
criminal prosecution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the Adult Protective
Services Act, P.L.1993, c.249 (C.52:27D-406 et seq.), a health care
professional, law enforcement officer, firefighter, paramedic or emergency
medical technician who has reasonable cause to believe that a vulnerable adult
is the subject of abuse, neglect or exploitation must report the information to
the county adult protective services provider.  Other persons with such
reasonable cause may report the information. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The act defines a &quot;vulnerable
adult&quot; as a person 18 years of age or older who resides in a community
setting and who, because of a physical or mental illness, disability or
deficiency, lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make, communicate, or
carry out decisions concerning his well-being and is the subject of abuse,
neglect or exploitation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the Adult Protective
Services Act, the county adult protective services provider must initiate an
investigation within 72 hours of a report.  If necessary, the provider may
petition a court for an order to conduct the investigation.  If the provider
finds reasonable cause to believe that the vulnerable adult has been the
subject of abuse, neglect or exploitation, the provider will determine the need
for protective services and arrange for such services. The director of a county
adult services provider may petition for a court order for services if he
determines that the vulnerable adult will incur a substantial risk of physical
harm or deterioration without protective services, and the adult refuses or is
unable to consent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The act further provides that
if the county director or his designee has reasonable cause to believe that a
caretaker or other person has committed a criminal act against a vulnerable
adult, the director must immediately report the information to local law
enforcement officials or the county prosecutor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would add bullying
of a vulnerable adult as grounds for an investigation and report.  The bill
defines bullying as any gesture, any written, verbal, or physical act, or
any electronic communication that causes a reasonable person to fear for his
safety or fear damage to his property.  Under the bill, health care providers
and first responders would be required to report bullying, in addition to
abuse, neglect, or exploitation, and other persons could report such acts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill adds to
the specific criminal acts that the county director is required to report to
law enforcement or the prosecutor a violation of  section 1 of P.L.2015, c.186
(C.2C:24-7.1), Endangering Another Person.  Under this statute, creating a risk
of injury to another person is a criminal offense ranging from a disorderly
persons offense to a crime of the third degree, depending on the offenders
criminal culpability and the degree of risk of injury to the victim.  If the offense
is committed against a person with a  developmental disability, the criminal
penalties are increased by one degree, so that they range from a crime of the
fourth degree to a crime of the second degree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A crime of the second degree
is generally punishable by a term of five to 10 years or a fine up to $150,000,
or both; a crime of the third degree, by a term of three to five years or a
fine up to $15,000, or both; and a crime of the fourth degree, by a term up to
18 months or a fine up to $10,000, or both. A disorderly persons offense is
generally punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months or a fine of
up to $1,000, or both.  </p>
