Under Pauls Law, P.L.2019, c.290, the board of education of a school district is required to coordinate the care of students with epilepsy and seizure disorders.  Parents or guardians seeking epilepsy or seizure disorder care for a student while at school are required to annually submit to the school nurse a seizure action plan for the student and provide written authorization for the provision of epilepsy or seizure disorder care.  The school nurse is then required to develop an individualized health care plan and an individualized emergency health care plan for the student and update the plans annually.  In addition, boards of education are required to ensure that all staff, including staff working with school-sponsored programs outside of the regular school day, are trained in the care of students with epilepsy and seizure disorders.  However, there is currently no requirement that this training be conducted at regular intervals. This bill would require that all school staff undergo training in the care of students with epilepsy and seizure disorders every two years.
