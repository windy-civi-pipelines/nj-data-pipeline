Under the bill, the operator of a ski area is not required to comply with these provisions if the ski area is operated by a nonprofit organization. The bill defines nonprofit organization to mean a private nonprofit corporation, society, or association that has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service of the United States Department of the Treasury to be exempt from income taxation under 26 U.S.C.s.501(c)(3).
