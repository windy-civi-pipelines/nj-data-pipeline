STATEMENT This resolution urges the United States Congress to pass comprehensive voting rights legislation.  On the third January of each year the United States observes Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in order to honor the memory, legacy, and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Dr. King worked tirelessly to advance voting rights for people of color in our nation. Recently, attacks on voting rights have increased across the country, making the need for improved protections of voting rights ever more apparent.  The United States Congress has the opportunity to pass two landmark voting rights bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. New Jersey has worked to increase voter access, including by introducing online voter registration for the 2020 election, and experienced record voter turnout for the same election, however the State is not immune to efforts to restrict voting rights as evidenced by some legislation introduced in the 2020-2021 session. The United States suffered immensely after the events of January 6, 2021, and now lives with the potent reminder that misinformation, fear, and bigotry are always present in our society, making the need for stronger voting protections more important than ever.
