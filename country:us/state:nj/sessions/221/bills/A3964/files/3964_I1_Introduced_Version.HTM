hours prior to the final certification of the results of the election other
than the general election, or in the case of a general election within 11 days

from the inner envelopes prior to the day of the election, the county board
shall implement the measures necessary to ensure the security and secrecy of
the mail-in ballots.  The contents of the mail-in ballots and the results of

accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, regulations
and guidelines concerning the disclosure of election results, and in no

process, the Secretary of State shall promulgate regulations to ensure that any
county board of elections that begins opening the inner envelopes and
canvassing the mail-in ballots from the inner envelopes prior to the closing of
the polls on election day shall do so in a manner that prevents any person,

any candidate for public office or any public question submitted to the voters

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill allows any voter to
vote in any political party primary election by changing his or her political
party affiliation at the polling place on primary election day. The bill also
allows voters who vote by mail-in ballot in the primary election to complete
any political partys primary ballot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, voters who
are unaffiliated with any political party because they did not declare a
political party affiliation on their voter registration form are permitted to
vote in the primary election of any political party, and once they do so they
become a member of that political party. Current law also provides that voters
who declared a political party affiliation are permitted to vote only in the
political party primary of that party. However, if a voter affiliated with one
political party wants to participate in the primary election of another
political party, they may do so by declaring affiliation with that other party
by filing a new voter registration form or a political party affiliation
declaration form on or before the 55th day preceding the primary election.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, any voter
would be permitted to vote in the primary election of any political party,
regardless of their declared political party affiliation on record. The bill
provides that voters who vote in person would be permitted to choose the
political party primary they wish to vote in at the polling place on primary
election day. If a voter wishes to vote in another partys primary than that of
their affiliation on record, the voter may file a political party affiliation
declaration form at the polling place. Under the bill, voters who vote by
mail-in ballot in the primary election would be permitted to complete the
ballot for any political party, and the voters completion and return of that
ballot would constitute a new political party affiliation. As required under
current law, a voter may complete only one political party primary ballot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill therefore
establishes an open primary process in this State by eliminating the 55-day
deadline for political party membership changes and allowing any registered
voter to participate in the political party primary of the voters choice. Under
the bill, the update of political party affiliation is retained for record-keeping
purposes. </p>
