(cf:  P.L.2005, c.244, s.7) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill revises the requirements for polysomnography license fees.  The bill provides that neither the initial license fee nor the license renewal fee shall exceed $150 for polysomnographic technologists or polysomnographic technicians, or $50 for polysomnographic trainees.  Currently, the fee for initial and renewed licensure as a polysomnographic technologist is $500, to be renewed on a biennial basis.  The fee for initial and renewed licensure as a polysomnographic technician is $150, and the fee for initial licensure as a trainee is $50. These fees are comparable to the initial licensing and license renewal fees for medical doctors.  This bill makes polysomnography initial licensing and license renewal fees more affordable for practitioners, and makes these fees comparable to other similarly trained licensed professionals at the same time.
