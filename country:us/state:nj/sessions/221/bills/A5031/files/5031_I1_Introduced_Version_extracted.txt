(cf: P.L.1991, c.188, s.1) 3.    (New section) The Commissioner of Community Affairs shall review the implementation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and, within one year of its effective date, provide a report to the Governor and the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), on its effectiveness and any challenges related to its implementation. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to any covered construction that commences after the date of enactment, provided that a grace period of six months from the date of enactment shall be given to construction projects for which plans are not yet completed and are in the process of plan development. STATEMENT This bill would establish a number of fire safety standards for light frame construction of new multiple dwellings, hotels, and rooming and boarding houses with more than two dwelling or sleeping units, and a fire warden requirement for all light frame construction. Under the bill, covered residential buildings may only be newly constructed utilizing light frame construction if: (1) an automatic sprinkler system is installed throughout the building in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 13; (2) the number of stories permitted is measured from grade plane excluding any pedestals or podiums; (3) the fire partitions and horizontal separations have a fire-resistance rating of at least two hours; (4) the fire partitions extend from the foundation to the attic; (5) the fire walls are resistant to moisture and capable of passing the hose stream test in accordance with the construction code; and (6) if any light framing is unprotected, the building is limited to three stories and does not exceed 60 feet above grade plane or, if all light framing is protected, the building is limited to four stories and does not exceed 85 feet above grade plane. In addition, for all new construction projects, this bill would require the owner or developer to hire a fire watch warden to provide monitoring of the construction project during non-working hours, or install comparable technology.  A fire watch warden must be present from the time the construction project begins until the final sprinkler inspection is completed or a temporary certificate of occupancy is issued.  In the event of a fire or other emergency, the fire watch warden must alert local first responders.  The fire watch warden must also report fire safety issues to the Division of Fire Safety in the Department of Community Affairs, which may request that the local construction code official revoke construction permits for projects posing fire safety risks.  The Division of Fire Safety may assess owners and developers of covered construction projects reasonable fees to cover the costs incurred by the division for carrying out its responsibilities under the bill. The bill also requires that an identifying emblem be affixed to each exterior entrance of a structure with light frame or truss construction to warn firefighters and the general public of the existence of light frame and truss-type construction in the structure. Under current law, an identifying emblem must be affixed to the front of a structure utilizing truss construction only. Lastly, the bill requires that placards identifying the primary structural system of a structure be placed adjacent to the fire alarm control panel and on an exterior wall within 10 feet of the main entrance to the structure.
