(4)   The Secretary of State shall enter into an agreement with the Administrative Office of the Courts to match information in the database of the Statewide voter registration system with State agency information on individuals who are incarcerated, on probation, or on parole as the result of a conviction for an indictable offense. (5)   The Secretary of State shall enter into an agreement with the State Parole Board to match information in the database of the Statewide voter registration system with State agency information on individuals who are on parole. (6)   The Secretary of State shall enter into an agreement with the Social Security Administration to match information in the database of the Statewide voter registration system with the database of deceased persons maintained by the Social Security Administration on or before October 1 of each year. (cf: P.L.2019, c.382, s.5) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides additional ways for deceased voters to be transferred from the active file to the death file of the Statewide voter registration system and requires the Secretary of State to conduct a match of the registration system with the database of deceased persons maintained by the Social Security Administration. Under current law, each month, the health officer or other officer in charge of records of death in each municipality is required to file with the commissioner of registration of the county in which the municipality is located the age, date of death, and the names and addresses of all persons 18 years of age or older who have died within such municipality during the previous month.  In addition, the State registrar of vital statistics, the Commissioner of the Department of Health, and funeral directors across the State are required to file death certificates. If the commissioner of registration finds sufficient evidence that the voter is deceased, the deceased voters record is transferred from the active file to the death file of the Statewide voter registration system. This bill provides additional ways for deceased voters records to be transferred.  Under the bill, the next of kin of a deceased voter will be permitted to submit a form created by the Secretary of State to have a deceased family member transferred from the active file to the death file.  In addition, the Director of the Division of Veterans Healthcare Services or an administrator of a nursing home facility may submit a form created by the Secretary of State to notify the commissioner of registration of a deceased resident and have the resident transferred from the active file to the death file.  Funeral home directors in the State would also be eligible to submit a form to the commissioner.
