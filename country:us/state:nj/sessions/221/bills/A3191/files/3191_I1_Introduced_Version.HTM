STATEMENT This bill would establish a fund to provide reimbursements to municipalities for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by a municipal police force or department for the management and control of crowds and traffic, as well as for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by a municipality for litter and garbage collection, and the provision of portable restrooms, related to crowds, at a New Jersey Motor Vehicles Commission (MVC) location during the COVID-19 pandemic.  When MVC locations were reopened to the public during this pandemic, there were massive crowds necessitating a police presence and sanitation efforts, at significant expense to the affected municipalities.  Since these costs were due to poor planning on the part of the State, and not the municipalities, the State should reimburse these municipalities for those costs. The bill appropriates $500,000 to the fund, which would be established within the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.  To obtain a reimbursement, a municipality would have to submit an application to the division in accordance with procedures specified by the division.  The bill would be retroactive to March 9, 2020, when Executive Order No. 103 was issued, declaring a public health emergency and state of emergency in response to COVID-19, and would expire upon the conclusion of both declared emergencies.
