Alimony, maintenance. Pending any matrimonial action or action for dissolution

divorce or dissolution or maintenance, whether obtained in this State or

the parties, and also as to the care, custody, education and maintenance of the
children, or any of them, as the circumstances of the parties and the nature of
the case shall render fit, reasonable and just, and require reasonable security
for the due observance of such orders, including, but not limited to, the
creation of trusts or other security devices, to assure payment of reasonably
foreseeable medical and educational expenses. Upon neglect or refusal to give
such reasonable security, as shall be required, or upon default in complying
with any such order, the court may award and issue process for the immediate
sequestration of the personal estate, and the rents and profits of the real
estate of the party so charged, and appoint a receiver thereof, and cause such
personal estate and the rents and profits of such real estate, or so much
thereof as shall be necessary, to be applied toward such alimony and maintenance
as to the said court shall from time to time seem reasonable and just; or the
performance of the said orders may be enforced by other ways according to the
practice of the court. Orders so made may be revised and altered by the court
from time to time as circumstances may require.</span></p>

court may order one party to pay a retainer on behalf of the other for expert
and legal services when the respective financial circumstances of the parties
make the award reasonable and just. In considering an application, the court
shall review the financial capacity of each party to conduct the litigation and
the criteria for award of counsel fees that are then pertinent as set forth by
court rule.  Whenever any other application is made to a court which includes an
application for pendente lite or final award of counsel fees, the court shall
determine the appropriate award for counsel fees, if any, at the same time that
a decision is rendered on the other issue then before the court and shall
consider the factors set forth in the court rule on counsel fees, the financial
circumstances of the parties, and the good or bad faith of either party. The
court may not order a retainer or counsel fee of a party convicted of an

from a severe mental or physical incapacity that causes the child to be
financially dependent on a parent.  The obligation to pay support for that
child shall continue until the court finds that the child is relieved of the
incapacity or is no longer financially dependent on the parent.  However, in
assessing the financial obligation of the parent, the court shall consider, in
addition to the factors enumerated in this section, the child's eligibility for
public benefits and services for people with disabilities and may make such
orders, including an order involving the creation of a trust, as are necessary

neither party having a greater entitlement to that standard of living than the
other;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (5)  The

availability of the training and employment, and the opportunity for future
acquisitions of capital assets and income;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (9)  The

of law on the reasons why the court reached that conclusion.  No factor shall
be elevated in importance over any other factor unless the court finds

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that if a
complaint has been filed for divorce, dissolution of a civil union, termination
of domestic partnership, or divorce from bed and board, and either party dies
prior to the entry of a final judgment, or the parties had and remained entered
into an equitable distribution cut-off agreement, termination agreement, or
marital settlement agreement where the underlying subject matter was for such
divorce, dissolution, or termination and a party to that agreement died prior
to the entry of a final judgment, the court would be authorized to proceed with
awarding an equitable distribution of the couples property.  The bill further
provides that under these circumstances, in which the surviving spouse or
partner would still be entitled to a divided portion of the former couples
property, that person would not instead have a right to an intestate share of
the decedents estate pursuant to N.J.S.3B:5-3, or an elective share of
one-third of the decedents augmented estate pursuant to N.J.S.3B:8-1 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would further make
the following types of surviving spouse or partner ineligible to receive an
intestate share or elective share of the decedents property, because of an
earlier arrangement providing for a distribution of the couples property:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     - if the person, at the time
of death of the decedent,  had (1) ceased to cohabit with the decedent under
circumstances which would have given rise to a cause of action for divorce or
nullity of marriage to a decedent prior to his or her death under the laws of
this State; and (2) where, through written agreement, affirmative acts, or both
written agreement and affirmative acts of the person and decedent there had
been a division of assets equivalent to equitable distribution; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     - a person who, at the time of
death of the decedent, had entered into a validly executed marital settlement
agreement with the decedent where the underlying subject matter of the marital
settlement agreement is divorce, dissolution of civil union, termination of
domestic partnership, or divorce from bed and board. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, if a spouse
or partner dies while the divorce,  dissolution, or termination is pending, the
survivor is excluded from an award of equitable distribution, as the matter
gets removed from the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part (the
family court) to be handled as a probate matter of the decedents estate.  In
such probate matters, if the surviving spouse or partner was no longer
cohabitating with the other spouse or partner at the time of death, the probate
law precludes that surviving spouse or partner from being able to claim an
elective share of the decedents estate.  Thus, in some scenarios, a surviving
spouse or partner who was still legally married or partnered at the time of the
others death, having not gotten an equitable distribution through the family
court, may also not have a claim on any share of the estate.  This bill would
address this by permitting the family court action to proceed and the surviving
spouse or partner receiving an award of equitable distribution of the former
couples property. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to addressing the
interplay between family law and probate law as heretofore described, the bill
clarifies the laws of intestate succession and those governing elective shares
of augmented estates by expressly including the surviving partner in a civil
union among the types of surviving persons who may have claims under such
laws.  Currently, the statutes being amended by the bill only expressly list a
surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner, however they apply to a
surviving civil union partner by virtue of section 4 of P.L.2006, c.103
(C.37:1-37), which states that [c]ivil union couples shall have all of the
same benefits, protections and responsibilities under law . . . as are granted
to spouses in a marriage.  Expressly listing them in these statutes provides
further clarity as to their applicability to civil union partners. </p>
