In accordance with 42 U.S.C. s.666(a)(5), a signed voluntary acknowledgment of paternity shall be considered a legal finding of paternity subject to the right of the signatory to rescind the acknowledgment within 60 days of the date of signing, or by the date of establishment of a support order to which the signatory is a party, whichever is earlier.

(cf: P.L.2019, c.323, s.5) 2.  (New section)  The mother of a child born out of wedlock and a father who has established paternity, shall be the de facto natural guardians of the child and are entitled and subject to the rights and responsibilities of a parent.  If a father has not established paternity, the mother of the child born out of wedlock shall be the natural guardian of the child. 3. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill clarifies the rights of a biological father whose name appears on the birth certificate of the child to request a determination of parental responsibility and child support and for the creation of a parenting plan pursuant to R.S.9:2-4. Presently, an unmarried biological father has no parental rights or obligations to a child until such time as paternity is established pursuant to one of the methods enumerated in N.J.S.A.9:17-41, which can include acknowledgment of parentage by certification.  Under the bill, a parent, whose name appears on the birth certificate, may request:  a determination of parental relationship pursuant to this section; (2) an order for child support pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1988, c.111 (C.2A:17-56.23a); and (3) court consideration of a  custody plan pursuant to R.S.9:2-4.  The bill further clarifies that the mother and a father who has established paternity are the natural guardians of the child and are entitled and subject to the rights and responsibilities of a parent.  If no paternity is established, the mother of the child born out of wedlock shall be the natural guardian of the child. This bill is based on House Bill 775, which was enacted in Florida in June 2023 as Chapter 2023-209.
