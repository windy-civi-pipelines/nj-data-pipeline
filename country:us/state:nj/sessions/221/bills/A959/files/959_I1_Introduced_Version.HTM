<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides municipal
property tax relief by requiring the State to allocate to municipalities that
share of the State portion of realty transfer fee proceeds that is derived from
the fee's &quot;general purpose fee&quot;, its fee on buyers of residential and
commercial property sold at a price of $1,000,000 or above, and the State share
of the &quot;basic fee&quot; that is not statutorily earmarked to other
purposes.  The fee's county share and its dedications to the New Jersey
Affordable Housing Trust Fund, the Extraordinary Aid Account, the Shore
Protection Fund, and the Highlands Protection Fund thus remain intact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If, in any fiscal year, the
State's annual appropriation act fails to appropriate to municipalities the
entire balance of the State portion of nondedicated realty transfer fee
proceeds, the county recording officers will only collect the county portion of
the fee, a provision intended to prohibit the State from appropriating the
revenue for other purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Municipalities must use the
realty transfer fee revenue they receive from the State exclusively to reduce
their property tax levies, with the Director of the Division of Local
Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs being required to
mandate budget changes to municipal governing bodies that are noncompliant with
that condition.  Each municipality receives a payment that corresponds to the
amount of the State portion of realty transfer fee payments on real estate
transactions that have occurred in that municipality less the share that those
transactions contribute to the aforementioned dedications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides for a
five-year phase-in period over which the State keeps a progressively decreasing
share of the nondedicated State portion of fee proceeds:  80 percent in the
first year following the bill's enactment, 60 percent in the second year, 40
percent in the third year, 20 percent in the fourth year, and zero percent in
the fifth year.  This transitional period smooths out the legislation's impact
on the State General Fund, which would have lost almost $190 million in fiscal
year 2012, if the bill's provisions had been in effect absent the phase-in
period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To compensate counties for the
cost associated with the additional workload this bill may cause, it enables
them to levy a $0.50 surcharge on the recording of each deed.</p>
