This tax, which is on the processor but may be passed along to the purchaser or seller, can therefore potentially raise a significant amount of revenue for New Jersey. For purposes of the tax, a financial transaction is a transaction involving the purchase or sale of a financial security. Security includes, but is not limited to, a futures contract, options contract, futures option contract, swap contract, credit default swap contract, derivative, or share of stock in an entity.
