CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the placement of early voting locations and ballot drop boxes and amending P.L.2021, c.40 and P.L.2020, c.72. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 1 of P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a.  In addition to all other forms of voting provided for by this Title, a registered voter shall be permitted to vote at a specially designated polling place before the day of certain primary and general elections in this State.  This procedure shall be known as early voting.  The early voting period shall: (1)   start on the 4th calendar day before a non-presidential primary election for a non-presidential general election and end on the second calendar day before that non-presidential primary election; (2)   start on the 6th calendar day before a presidential primary election for a presidential general election and end on the second calendar day before that presidential primary election; or (3)   start on the 10th calendar day before a general election and end on the second calendar day before that general election. The voting process during the early voting period shall be conducted using electronic poll books and optical-scan voting machines that read hand-marked paper ballots or other voting machines that produce a voter-verifiable paper ballot.  Any municipality conducting regular municipal elections in May pursuant to the provisions of the "Uniform Nonpartisan Elections Law," P.L.1981, c.379 (C.40:45-5 et seq.), may, by an ordinance adopted by its governing body, also conduct early voting for the regular municipal election, in accordance with the provisions of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1 et al.).  If adopted by a municipal governing body, the early voting period for a regular municipal election in May shall start on the 4th calendar day before the regular municipal election and end on the second calendar day before that regular municipal election.  An early voting period shall only be permitted for a non-presidential or presidential primary election and a general election in this State and, if adopted by a municipal governing body, a regular municipal election conducted in May. Pursuant to the provisions of this act and Title 19 of the Revised Statutes and in accordance with procedures that may be established by the Secretary of State for verifying eligible voters, each county board of elections shall verify that a registered voter is qualified to vote in the election and shall prescribe the manner by which a registered voter may vote during such period. b.  (1) For the primary and the general election, each county board of elections shall designate at least three, but not more than five, public locations within each county as the sites for early voting to occur, except that the county board shall designate at least five, but not more than seven, public locations for early voting if the number of registered voters in the county is at least 150,000 but less than 300,000, and shall designate at least seven, but not more than 10, public locations for early voting if the number of registered voters in the county is 300,000 or more.  This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent county boards of elections, at their discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess of the five, seven, or 10 location limits respectively set forth herein; provided, however, that the State shall be required to provide reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and including the five, seven, or 10 respective limits established herein, and shall not be required to provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond those limits under section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  The number of registered voters in each county shall be determined ahead of the selection of early voting sites pursuant to a uniform standard which shall be developed by the Secretary of State through the rulemaking process pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).  Whenever possible, early voting locations shall be geographically located so as to ensure both access in the part of the county that features the greatest concentration of population, according to the most recent federal decennial census of the United States, and access in various geographic areas of the county.  All early voting locations shall be public facilities, such as county courthouses, public libraries and the offices of the municipal clerk, county clerk, and county board of elections, or places of public accommodation as provided under Title 10 of the Revised Statutes. No public school building and no building used as a public school, as that term is defined under N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall, however, be designated as an early voting location.  The locations shall be designated at the same time as all other polling places are designated by the board of elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members of the county board with respect to the selection of sites for early voting, the county clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are designated in each county, county boards of election shall evaluate and, if deemed necessary, revise these locations in order to accommodate significant changes in the number of registered voters within each county, reflect the population distribution and density within each county, or because of similar circumstances.  The Secretary of State may develop the criteria to be used by county boards of election to revise the location of early voting sites and shall prescribe how often such revision shall take place. A voter shall be permitted to vote at any early voting site in the voter's county. (2)   Whenever a municipality that conducts regular municipal elections in May chooses to participate in early voting for the regular municipal election, the county board of elections shall designate at least one public location, but not more than three public locations, within the municipality as the site or sites for early voting to occur. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent a county board of elections, at its discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess of the three location limit set forth herein; provided, however, that the State shall be required to provide reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and including the three location limit established herein, and shall not be required to provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond that limit under section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  Whenever possible, each such location shall be geographically located in the part of the municipality that features the greatest concentration of population, according to the most recent federal decennial census of the United States.  All early voting locations shall be public facilities, such as municipal courthouses and the offices of the municipal clerk, or places of public accommodation as provided under Title 10 of the Revised Statutes.  No public school building and no building used as a public school, as that term is defined under N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall be designated as an early voting location.  The locations shall be designated at the same time as all other polling places are designated by the board of elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members of the county board with respect to the selection of sites for early voting, the municipal clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are designated in each municipality, county boards of election shall evaluate and, if deemed necessary, revise these locations in order to accommodate significant changes in the number of registered voters within each municipality, reflect the population distribution and density within each municipality, or because of similar circumstances.  The Secretary of State may develop the criteria to be used by county boards of election to revise the location of early voting sites and shall prescribe how often such revision shall take place. A voter shall be permitted to vote at any early voting site in the voter's municipality. (3)  At least 50 percent of the early voting locations in a county shall be in municipalities that have the lowest voter participation as measured by the lowest percentage of ballots cast as a proportion of total registered voters from the previous three statewide elections.  At least 50 percent of the early voting locations shall be accessible by public transportation. c.     Each early voting site in a county or municipality shall be open for early voting on Monday through Saturday from at least 10 AM to 8 PM, and on Sunday from at least 10 AM to 6 PM.  Any voter who is on line at the time scheduled for the closing of an early voting site shall be permitted to vote. d.    The election officers responsible for conducting early voting shall be the same as those responsible for conducting a primary and a general election, as appropriate, pursuant to this Title.  The number of such officers and their hours of service shall be as determined by each county board of elections.  The compensation for such officers shall be the same as provided to district board of election members serving at a school election pursuant to R.S.19:45-6, or that required pursuant to Article I, paragraph 23 of the New Jersey Constitution, whichever is greater. e.     The restrictions governing the conduct of voters at a polling place on the days that early voting occurs, the procedures governing who is permitted in a polling place on such occasions and the prohibition on electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place during an election, shall be as provided in chapters 15, 34, 50 and 52 of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes and every other applicable section of this Title. f.     In real time using the electronic poll books each day during the early voting period, and prior to the start of each regularly scheduled primary and general election, and regular municipal election in each non-partisan municipality choosing to participate in early voting, each county board shall make such changes as may be necessary to the voter's record in the Statewide voter registration system to indicate that a voter has voted in that election using the early voting procedure. g.  (1) Each county board shall be responsible for forming and executing a written plan to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, the integrity of the voting process and the security of ballots used during the early voting period, including the security of voting machines, voted ballots, and election records.  The plan shall be based on guidelines established by the Secretary of State and shall be submitted thereto no later than December 15 of each year.  The Secretary of State shall review and, if deemed necessary thereby, require changes to a plan no later than February 1 of each year.  Each plan shall specify a chain of custody and security plan for the voting machines, and a chain of custody for the voted ballots and election records and materials, and shall require, among other specifications deemed necessary by the Secretary of State and county boards of election, that all voted ballots shall be transferred at the end of each early voting day to county boards of election for safekeeping.  After the voted ballots are transferred to the county board of elections at the end of each early voting day, a county board may elect to impound those voted ballots on a secure server, or by any other means deemed appropriate by the Secretary of State.  The voted ballots shall not be canvassed until the closing of the polls on election day as required pursuant to section 4 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-4).  The results of the voted ballots cast during early voting shall remain confidential and shall be disclosed only in accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, regulations, and guidelines concerning the disclosure of election results, and a violation shall be subject to the penalties established by law. (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, in the year in which P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1 et al.) becomes law, each county board shall submit its plan to the Secretary of State within 30 days following the effective date of this act and the Secretary of State shall review it and, if deemed necessary thereby, require changes in the plan within 45 days following the effective date of this act. h.    Each county board shall make certain that each polling place used for early voting shall be accessible to individuals with disabilities and the elderly, in compliance with the "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990" (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et seq.), and that each polling place provides such voters, including the blind and visually impaired, the same opportunity for access and participation, including privacy and independence, as other voters in compliance with the "Help America Vote Act of 2002" (42 U.S.C. s.15481). i.     The Secretary of State shall establish a printing on demand ballot and elections system.  At a minimum, the system shall be compatible with the Statewide voter registration system established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.145 (C.19:31-31) and any electronic poll books provided by section 1 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-35).  Each polling place used for early voting shall have a computer, tablet, or other electronic device to print provisional ballots for voters required to vote by provisional ballot in accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes or due to an equipment malfunction as further provided under section 3 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-37), or any other election related material, if needed.  A computer, tablet, or other electronic device and the printer used to print election materials at a polling place shall not be used unless it has been certified by the Secretary of State.  The Secretary of State shall adopt and publish standards and regulations governing the certification and use of computer, tablets, or other electronic devices and printers to print election materials at each polling place used for early voting.  The Secretary of State shall not certify a computer, tablet, or other electronic device or printer unless it is in compliance with the secretary's standards. j.     Each polling place used for early voting shall also have such appropriate supplies, ballots and other materials deemed necessary by the Secretary of State or as is required currently for a polling place on the day of any election by Title 19 of the Revised Statutes. (cf: P.L.2021, c.40, s.1) 2.    Section 1 of P.L.2020, c.72 (C.19:63-16.1) is amended to read as follows: 1. a. In addition to delivering a voted mail-in ballot by mail or in person as provided under "The Vote By Mail Law," P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-1 et seq.), a mail-in voter shall be entitled to deposit the voter's completed mail-in ballot in a ballot drop box established by the county board of elections as provided under this section. Each mail-in ballot deposited in a ballot drop box by the time designated under current law for the closing of the polls for that election shall be considered valid and shall be canvassed.  If, at the closing of the polls, a voter deposits a mail-in ballot at a ballot drop box in a county in which the voter does not reside, the county board of elections, upon discovering that fact, shall notify and timely deliver the ballot to the county board of elections of the county in which the voter resides, who shall accept the ballot for processing.  The limitations and prohibitions applicable to mail-in ballot bearers under "The Vote By Mail Law," P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-1 et seq.) shall apply under this section. b. (1) For any election, the county board of elections in each county shall establish ballot drop boxes where voters may deposit their voted mail-in ballots at least 45 days before the election.  The ballot drop boxes shall be located throughout the county in a manner specified under paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The county board of elections may establish a pickup schedule to retrieve mail-in ballots deposited in ballot drop boxes, consistent with the guidelines established by the Secretary of State pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2) (a) A ballot drop box shall mean a secured drop box that is not required to be within view of a live person for monitoring.  All ballot drop boxes shall be available for use by a voter 24 hours a day and shall be placed at locations equipped with security cameras that allow for surveillance of the ballot drop box. (b) Beginning with the 2021 general election, at least one ballot drop box shall be located: at any county government building in which the main office of the county clerk is located; in each municipality with a population larger than 5,000 residents; at the main campus of each State college or university; and the main campus of each independent four-year college or university with enrollments larger than 5,000 students.  Notwithstanding the locational criteria established by this subparagraph, whenever two or more ballot drop box locations are separated by a distance of less than 2,000 feet, the board of elections in each county shall determine secondary locations for those ballot drop boxes in compliance with the requirements of this section.  The secondary ballot drop box locations shall be located within the municipality where those ballot drop boxes were originally located and shall be approved by a majority vote of the members of the board of elections.  However, in the event of a tie in the votes cast by the members of the board of elections, the county clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Whenever possible, at least one ballot drop box shall be located in a municipality with an average per capita income or a median family income at or below 250% of the federal poverty guideline according to the most recent federal American Community Survey. (c) The board of elections in each county shall establish no fewer than 10 ballot drop boxes.  To the best of their ability, the board of elections of every county shall place secure ballot drop boxes based on geographic location and population density to best serve the voters of each county in compliance with the guidelines adopted pursuant to subsection c. of this section.  The Secretary of State shall establish guidelines for the placement of the ballot drop boxes, the security of the ballot drop boxes, and the schedule for ballot pickup from the ballot boxes. (d) All ballot drop box locations shall be on sites that meet the accessibility requirements applicable to polling places under R.S.19:8-2 and shall be subject to the same compliance oversight applicable to polling places under section 3 of P.L.1991, c.429 (C.19:8-3.3).  A ballot drop box site shall be considered accessible if it is in compliance with the federal "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990" (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et seq.). (e) Except as otherwise provided herein, no ballot drop box shall be located inside, or within 100 feet of an entrance or exit, of a State, county, or municipal police station. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph, a ballot drop box that has already been installed and permanently affixed prior to the effective date of this act, P.L.2021, c.459, at any of the following locations may remain at that location notwithstanding that the ballot drop box is within 100 feet of an entrance or exit of a State, county, or municipal police station if the county commissioners approve the continued presence at that location by a majority vote of the commissioners and with the reasons therefor subject to public disclosure: any county government building in which the main office of the county clerk is located; any municipal government building in which the main office of the municipal clerk is located in municipalities with populations larger than 5,000 residents; the main campus of a county community college; the main campus of a State college or university; and the main campus of an independent four-year college or university with enrollments larger than 5,000 students. (f) Except as otherwise permitted herein, no State, county, or municipal police officer shall remain or stand within 100 feet of a ballot drop box in use during the conduct of an election.  Nothing herein shall be interpreted to prohibit the police officer from: voting at that ballot drop box in a personal capacity; traveling to and from, or remaining within, their personal residence if that residence is within 100 feet of a ballot drop box; investigating, addressing, or removing any cause for a disturbance, or otherwise responding to a request for assistance, on or around the premises of the location of that ballot drop box; or escorting to or from, or both, a ballot drop box or the premise on which it is located any person who may require the assistance of the officer. (g) No person shall wear, display, sell, give, or provide any political or campaign slogan, badge, button, or other insignia associated with any political party or candidate within 100 feet of a ballot drop box in use during the conduct of an election, except with respect to the badge furnished by the county board as provided by law.  A person violating the provisions of this subparagraph shall be guilty of a disorderly persons offense. (h)   At least 50 percent of the drop boxes in a county shall be in municipalities that have the lowest voter participation as measured by the lowest percentage of ballots cast as a proportion of total registered voters from the previous three statewide elections.  At least 50 percent of the drop boxes shall be accessible by public transportation. c.     The Secretary of State, in consultation with county boards of elections, shall establish the guidelines necessary to ensure the secure and successful implementation of the mail-in ballot drop boxes required by this section to ensure adequate access in various geographic areas of the county.  In determining the ballot drop box locations, the secretary and county boards of elections shall consider, at a minimum, concentrations of population, geographic areas, voter convenience, proximity to public transportation, community-based locations, travel time to the location, proximity to other voting locations and ballot drop boxes, commuter traffic patterns, and security.  The guidelines shall include, but may not be limited to, criteria for each county board of elections to: (1) determine the number of ballot drop boxes required per voter population, considering both the number of registered voters and the number of registered mail-in voters in each county before each election; (2) select the geographic location of each ballot drop box, ensuring an equitable distribution of ballot drop boxes across the county to maximize convenience to voters; (3) ensure the accessibility of ballot drop boxes and drop box locations to persons with disabilities; and (4) maintain the security of ballot drop boxes and of the ballots deposited therein, including standards and procedures for ballot retrieval by authorized persons only, and for ensuring the proper chain of custody and safe storage of voted mail-in ballots before each election. d.    Each county clerk shall include the locations of the ballot drop boxes established in the county along with the instructions furnished with the mail-in ballot package sent to each mail-in voter pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-7).  At least 45 days before each election, each county board of elections shall cause to be published on their respective websites the location of the ballot drop boxes in each county, and shall provide this information to the Secretary of State for publishing the same on the Division of Elections website. e.     Whenever a municipal, school, or special election is held, the board shall, at a minimum, open the ballot drop box located geographically closest to the municipal government building in which the main office of the municipal clerk is located and the ballot drop box located at the board of elections or county office, if one is placed at that location.  When a school election encompasses more than one municipality, the board shall be responsible for the selection of the ballot drop box location with respect to each municipality. (cf: P.L.2022, c.70, s.4) 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill changes the requirements of the placement of early voting locations and ballot drop boxes in this State. The requirements in this bill are intended to make voting more accessible to certain residents in New Jersey. At least 50 percent of the early voting centers and ballot drop boxes in a county are to be located in municipalities that have the lowest voter turnout percentages in that county.  At least 50 percent of the early voting locations and ballot drop boxes are also to be placed in locations that are accessible by public transportation.

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, in the year in which P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1 et al.) becomes law, each county board shall submit its plan to the Secretary of State within 30 days following the effective date of this act and the Secretary of State shall review it and, if deemed necessary thereby, require changes in the plan within 45 days following the effective date of this act. h.    Each county board shall make certain that each polling place used for early voting shall be accessible to individuals with disabilities and the elderly, in compliance with the "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990" (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et seq.), and that each polling place provides such voters, including the blind and visually impaired, the same opportunity for access and participation, including privacy and independence, as other voters in compliance with the "Help America Vote Act of 2002" (42 U.S.C. s.15481). i.     The Secretary of State shall establish a printing on demand ballot and elections system.  At a minimum, the system shall be compatible with the Statewide voter registration system established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.145 (C.19:31-31) and any electronic poll books provided by section 1 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-35).  Each polling place used for early voting shall have a computer, tablet, or other electronic device to print provisional ballots for voters required to vote by provisional ballot in accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes or due to an equipment malfunction as further provided under section 3 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-37), or any other election related material, if needed.  A computer, tablet, or other electronic device and the printer used to print election materials at a polling place shall not be used unless it has been certified by the Secretary of State.  The Secretary of State shall adopt and publish standards and regulations governing the certification and use of computer, tablets, or other electronic devices and printers to print election materials at each polling place used for early voting.  The Secretary of State shall not certify a computer, tablet, or other electronic device or printer unless it is in compliance with the secretary's standards. j.     Each polling place used for early voting shall also have such appropriate supplies, ballots and other materials deemed necessary by the Secretary of State or as is required currently for a polling place on the day of any election by Title 19 of the Revised Statutes. (cf: P.L.2021, c.40, s.1) 2.    Section 1 of P.L.2020, c.72 (C.19:63-16.1) is amended to read as follows: 1. a. In addition to delivering a voted mail-in ballot by mail or in person as provided under "The Vote By Mail Law," P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-1 et seq.), a mail-in voter shall be entitled to deposit the voter's completed mail-in ballot in a ballot drop box established by the county board of elections as provided under this section. Each mail-in ballot deposited in a ballot drop box by the time designated under current law for the closing of the polls for that election shall be considered valid and shall be canvassed.  If, at the closing of the polls, a voter deposits a mail-in ballot at a ballot drop box in a county in which the voter does not reside, the county board of elections, upon discovering that fact, shall notify and timely deliver the ballot to the county board of elections of the county in which the voter resides, who shall accept the ballot for processing.  The limitations and prohibitions applicable to mail-in ballot bearers under "The Vote By Mail Law," P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-1 et seq.) shall apply under this section. b. (1) For any election, the county board of elections in each county shall establish ballot drop boxes where voters may deposit their voted mail-in ballots at least 45 days before the election.  The ballot drop boxes shall be located throughout the county in a manner specified under paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The county board of elections may establish a pickup schedule to retrieve mail-in ballots deposited in ballot drop boxes, consistent with the guidelines established by the Secretary of State pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2) (a) A ballot drop box shall mean a secured drop box that is not required to be within view of a live person for monitoring.  All ballot drop boxes shall be available for use by a voter 24 hours a day and shall be placed at locations equipped with security cameras that allow for surveillance of the ballot drop box. (b) Beginning with the 2021 general election, at least one ballot drop box shall be located: at any county government building in which the main office of the county clerk is located; in each municipality with a population larger than 5,000 residents; at the main campus of each State college or university; and the main campus of each independent four-year college or university with enrollments larger than 5,000 students.  Notwithstanding the locational criteria established by this subparagraph, whenever two or more ballot drop box locations are separated by a distance of less than 2,000 feet, the board of elections in each county shall determine secondary locations for those ballot drop boxes in compliance with the requirements of this section.  The secondary ballot drop box locations shall be located within the municipality where those ballot drop boxes were originally located and shall be approved by a majority vote of the members of the board of elections.  However, in the event of a tie in the votes cast by the members of the board of elections, the county clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Whenever possible, at least one ballot drop box shall be located in a municipality with an average per capita income or a median family income at or below 250% of the federal poverty guideline according to the most recent federal American Community Survey. (c) The board of elections in each county shall establish no fewer than 10 ballot drop boxes.  To the best of their ability, the board of elections of every county shall place secure ballot drop boxes based on geographic location and population density to best serve the voters of each county in compliance with the guidelines adopted pursuant to subsection c. of this section.  The Secretary of State shall establish guidelines for the placement of the ballot drop boxes, the security of the ballot drop boxes, and the schedule for ballot pickup from the ballot boxes. (d) All ballot drop box locations shall be on sites that meet the accessibility requirements applicable to polling places under R.S.19:8-2 and shall be subject to the same compliance oversight applicable to polling places under section 3 of P.L.1991, c.429 (C.19:8-3.3).  A ballot drop box site shall be considered accessible if it is in compliance with the federal "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990" (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et seq.). (e) Except as otherwise provided herein, no ballot drop box shall be located inside, or within 100 feet of an entrance or exit, of a State, county, or municipal police station. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph, a ballot drop box that has already been installed and permanently affixed prior to the effective date of this act, P.L.2021, c.459, at any of the following locations may remain at that location notwithstanding that the ballot drop box is within 100 feet of an entrance or exit of a State, county, or municipal police station if the county commissioners approve the continued presence at that location by a majority vote of the commissioners and with the reasons therefor subject to public disclosure: any county government building in which the main office of the county clerk is located; any municipal government building in which the main office of the municipal clerk is located in municipalities with populations larger than 5,000 residents; the main campus of a county community college; the main campus of a State college or university; and the main campus of an independent four-year college or university with enrollments larger than 5,000 students. (f) Except as otherwise permitted herein, no State, county, or municipal police officer shall remain or stand within 100 feet of a ballot drop box in use during the conduct of an election.  Nothing herein shall be interpreted to prohibit the police officer from: voting at that ballot drop box in a personal capacity; traveling to and from, or remaining within, their personal residence if that residence is within 100 feet of a ballot drop box; investigating, addressing, or removing any cause for a disturbance, or otherwise responding to a request for assistance, on or around the premises of the location of that ballot drop box; or escorting to or from, or both, a ballot drop box or the premise on which it is located any person who may require the assistance of the officer. (g) No person shall wear, display, sell, give, or provide any political or campaign slogan, badge, button, or other insignia associated with any political party or candidate within 100 feet of a ballot drop box in use during the conduct of an election, except with respect to the badge furnished by the county board as provided by law.  A person violating the provisions of this subparagraph shall be guilty of a disorderly persons offense. (h)   At least 50 percent of the drop boxes in a county shall be in municipalities that have the lowest voter participation as measured by the lowest percentage of ballots cast as a proportion of total registered voters from the previous three statewide elections.  At least 50 percent of the drop boxes shall be accessible by public transportation. c.     The Secretary of State, in consultation with county boards of elections, shall establish the guidelines necessary to ensure the secure and successful implementation of the mail-in ballot drop boxes required by this section to ensure adequate access in various geographic areas of the county.  In determining the ballot drop box locations, the secretary and county boards of elections shall consider, at a minimum, concentrations of population, geographic areas, voter convenience, proximity to public transportation, community-based locations, travel time to the location, proximity to other voting locations and ballot drop boxes, commuter traffic patterns, and security.  The guidelines shall include, but may not be limited to, criteria for each county board of elections to: (1) determine the number of ballot drop boxes required per voter population, considering both the number of registered voters and the number of registered mail-in voters in each county before each election; (2) select the geographic location of each ballot drop box, ensuring an equitable distribution of ballot drop boxes across the county to maximize convenience to voters; (3) ensure the accessibility of ballot drop boxes and drop box locations to persons with disabilities; and (4) maintain the security of ballot drop boxes and of the ballots deposited therein, including standards and procedures for ballot retrieval by authorized persons only, and for ensuring the proper chain of custody and safe storage of voted mail-in ballots before each election. d.    Each county clerk shall include the locations of the ballot drop boxes established in the county along with the instructions furnished with the mail-in ballot package sent to each mail-in voter pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-7).  At least 45 days before each election, each county board of elections shall cause to be published on their respective websites the location of the ballot drop boxes in each county, and shall provide this information to the Secretary of State for publishing the same on the Division of Elections website. e.     Whenever a municipal, school, or special election is held, the board shall, at a minimum, open the ballot drop box located geographically closest to the municipal government building in which the main office of the municipal clerk is located and the ballot drop box located at the board of elections or county office, if one is placed at that location.  When a school election encompasses more than one municipality, the board shall be responsible for the selection of the ballot drop box location with respect to each municipality. (cf: P.L.2022, c.70, s.4) 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill changes the requirements of the placement of early voting locations and ballot drop boxes in this State. The requirements in this bill are intended to make voting more accessible to certain residents in New Jersey. At least 50 percent of the early voting centers and ballot drop boxes in a county are to be located in municipalities that have the lowest voter turnout percentages in that county.  At least 50 percent of the early voting locations and ballot drop boxes are also to be placed in locations that are accessible by public transportation.
