(cf: P.L.2012, c.1, s.1) 2.    Section 21 of P.L.2010, c.122 (C.18A:37-24) is amended to read as follows: 21.  a.   The Department of Education, in consultation with the Division on Civil Rights in the Department of Law and Public Safety shall develop a guidance document for use by parents or guardians, students, and school districts to assist in resolving complaints concerning student harassment, intimidation, or bullying behaviors and the implementation of P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-13 et seq.) by school districts. The document shall include: (1)   a school district's obligations under P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-13 et seq.); (2)   best practices for the prevention, intervention, and remediation of harassment, intimidation, or bullying in schools, including methods to identify and assist student populations at high risk for harassment, intimidation, or bullying; (3)   a clear explanation of the procedures for petitioning the Commissioner of Education to hear and decide disputes concerning P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-13 et seq.); (4)   a clear explanation of the Division on Civil Rights' jurisdiction and services in regard to specific types of harassment, intimidation, or bullying; [and] (5)   a clear explanation of the process for appealing final agency determinations to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court; (6)   clarification of ways in which harassment, intimidation, or bullying may substantially disrupt or interfere with the orderly operation of the school or the rights of other students; and (7)   a clear explanation of the rights of students who are the alleged victims of harassment, intimidation, or bullying or who are accused of harassment, intimidation, or bullying. b.    The guidance document shall be available on the Department of Education's and the Division on Civil Rights' Internet sites and on every school district's Internet site at an easily accessible location. c.     A school district shall distribute annually to parents and guardians who have children enrolled in the school district a copy of the explanation of student rights, which has been included in the guidance document pursuant to paragraph (7) of subsection a. of this section. (cf: P.L.2010, c.122, s.21) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Current law requires each school district to adopt a policy prohibiting harassment, intimidation or bullying.  The law also specifies the various provisions which the policy must, at a minimum, contain. This bill requires certain additional provisions be included in the anti-bullying policy.  Pursuant to the bill, the policy must include a provision stating that students involved in an alleged incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying will not be interviewed by any school personnel without the parent or guardian having been provided an opportunity to be present.  The policy must also provide that after having been informed of the bullying incident and having notified the parents or guardians, the principal must use conflict resolution techniques with the students involved in the incident in order to resolve the matter.  If the conflict resolution techniques are unsuccessful, the next step in the process requires the principal to make a preliminary determination as to whether a reported incident or complaint is a report of an act of harassment, intimidation, or bullying as those terms are defined by law, prior to initiating an investigation. The bill provides that the investigation of the alleged harassment, intimidation, or bullying incident must be completed no later than 30 days from the date the written report of the incident is provided to the principal.  Current law requires the investigation to be completed no later than 10 days from the date the written report is provided.  This bill extends the time frame to allow a sufficient time period for the principal to implement conflict resolution techniques and make a preliminary determination regarding the alleged incident. Under current law, once the investigation is completed, parents or guardians are provided information in writing regarding the investigation, including the nature of the investigation, whether the district found evidence of harassment, intimidation, or bullying, or whether discipline was imposed or services provided to address the incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying.  The bill requires that the information provided to the parents or guardians must also include copies of all written records produced in regard to the investigation, including emails, letters, and text messages. The Department of Education, in consultation with the Division on Civil Rights in the Department of Law and Public Safety, is required by law to develop a guidance document for use by parents or guardians, students, and school districts to assist in resolving complaints concerning harassment, intimidation, or bullying.  This bill requires additional items to be included in the guidance document: a clarification of the ways in which harassment, intimidation, or bullying may be deemed to have substantially disrupted or interfered with the orderly operation of the school or the rights of other students; and a clear explanation of the rights of the students who are the alleged victims or the alleged perpetrators of incidents of harassment, intimidation, or bullying.  A copy of the explanation of the students rights is required to be provided by the district to the parents and guardians of students enrolled in the district.
