<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 3 of P.L.2002,
c.83 (C.18A:37-15) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.   Each school
district shall adopt a policy prohibiting harassment, intimidation or bullying
on school property, at a school-sponsored function or on a school bus. The
school district shall adopt the policy through a process that includes
representation of parents or guardians, school employees, volunteers, students,
administrators, and community representatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A school district shall
have local control over the content of the policy, except that the policy shall
contain, at a minimum, the following components:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a statement prohibiting
harassment, intimidation or bullying of a student;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   a definition of
harassment, intimidation or bullying no less inclusive than that set forth in
section 2 of P.L.2002,&nbsp;c.83&nbsp;(C.18A:37-14);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   a description of the
type of behavior expected from each student;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   consequences and
appropriate remedial action for a person who commits an act of harassment,
intimidation or bullying;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   a procedure for
reporting an act of harassment, intimidation or bullying, including a provision
that permits a person to report an act of harassment, intimidation or bullying
anonymously; however, this shall not be construed to permit formal disciplinary
action solely on the basis of an anonymous report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All acts of harassment,
intimidation, or bullying shall be reported verbally to the school principal on
the same day when the school employee or contracted service provider witnessed
or received reliable information regarding any such incident.  The principal
shall inform the parents or guardians of all students involved in the alleged
incident, and may discuss, as appropriate, the availability of counseling and
other intervention services.  <u>A student involved in the alleged incident
shall not be interviewed by any school personnel without the parent or guardian
being provided the opportunity to be present at the interview.  The principal
shall use conflict resolution techniques with the students involved in the
alleged incident to address and resolve the matter.  If the conflict resolution
techniques are deemed unsuccessful by the principal, he or his designee, in
consultation with the anti-bullying specialist, shall make a preliminary
determination as to whether a reported incident or complaint is a report of an
act of harassment, intimidation, or bullying pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2002,
c.83 (C.18A:37-14) prior to initiating an investigation.</u>  All acts of
harassment, intimidation, or bullying shall be reported in writing to the
school principal within two school days of when the school employee or
contracted service provider witnessed or received reliable information that a
student had been subject to harassment, intimidation, or bullying;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   a procedure for prompt
investigation of reports of violations and complaints, which procedure shall at
a minimum provide that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   the investigation shall
be initiated by the principal or the principal's designee <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>within one
school day of the report of the incident<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
and shall be conducted by a school anti-bullying specialist.  The principal may
appoint additional personnel who are not school anti-bullying specialists to
assist in the investigation.  The investigation shall be completed as soon as
possible, but not later than <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>10<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>30</u>
school days from the date of the written report of the incident of harassment,
intimidation, or bullying.  In the event that there is information relative to
the investigation that is anticipated but not yet received by the end of the <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>10-day<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>30-day</u>
period, the school anti-bullying specialist may amend the original report of
the results of the investigation to reflect the information;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   the results of the
investigation shall be reported to the superintendent of schools within two
school days of the completion of the investigation, and in accordance with
regulations promulgated by the State Board of Education pursuant to the
&quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.),
the superintendent may decide to provide intervention services, establish
training programs to reduce harassment, intimidation, or bullying and enhance
school climate, impose discipline, order counseling as a result of the findings
of the investigation, or take or recommend other appropriate action;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   the results of each
investigation shall be reported to the board of education no later than the
date of the board of education meeting next following the completion of the
investigation, along with information on any services provided, training

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law requires each
school district to adopt a policy prohibiting harassment, intimidation or
bullying.  The law also specifies the various provisions which the policy must,
at a minimum, contain. This bill requires certain additional provisions be
included in the anti-bullying policy.  Pursuant to the bill, the policy must
include a provision stating that students involved in an alleged incident of
harassment, intimidation, or bullying will not be interviewed by any school
personnel without the parent or guardian having been provided an opportunity to
be present.  The policy must also provide that after having been informed of
the bullying incident and having notified the parents or guardians, the
principal must use conflict resolution techniques with the students involved in
the incident in order to resolve the matter.  If the conflict resolution
techniques are unsuccessful, the next step in the process requires the principal
to make a preliminary determination as to whether a reported incident or
complaint is a report of an act of harassment, intimidation, or bullying as
those terms are defined by law, prior to initiating an investigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
investigation of the alleged harassment, intimidation, or bullying incident
must be completed no later than 30 days from the date the written report of the
incident is provided to the principal.  Current law requires the investigation
to be completed no later than 10 days from the date the written report is
provided.  This bill extends the time frame to allow a sufficient time period
for the principal to implement conflict resolution techniques and make a
preliminary determination regarding the alleged incident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, once the
investigation is completed, parents or guardians are provided information in
writing regarding the investigation, including the nature of the investigation,
whether the district found evidence of harassment, intimidation, or bullying,
or whether discipline was imposed or services provided to address the incident
of harassment, intimidation, or bullying.  The bill requires that the
information provided to the parents or guardians must also include copies of
all written records produced in regard to the investigation, including emails,
letters, and text messages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Department of Education,
in consultation with the Division on Civil Rights in the Department of Law and
Public Safety, is required by law to develop a guidance document for use by
parents or guardians, students, and school districts to assist in resolving
complaints concerning harassment, intimidation, or bullying.  This bill
requires additional items to be included in the guidance document: a
clarification of the ways in which harassment, intimidation, or bullying may be
deemed to have substantially disrupted or interfered with the orderly operation
of the school or the rights of other students; and a clear explanation of the
rights of the students who are the alleged victims or the alleged perpetrators
of incidents of harassment, intimidation, or bullying.  A copy of the
explanation of the students rights is required to be provided by the district
to the parents and guardians of students enrolled in the district.   </p>
