For the purposes of this subsection, "district certified recycling coordinator" means a person who shall have completed the requirements of a course of instruction in various aspects of recycling program management, as determined and administered by the department; "total municipal solid waste stream" means the sum of the municipal solid waste stream disposed of as solid waste, as measured in tons, plus the total number of tons of recyclable materials recycled; and "total solid waste stream" means the aggregate amount of solid waste generated within the boundaries of any county from all sources of generation, including the municipal solid waste stream. c.     Each district recycling plan, in designating a strategy for the collection, marketing and disposition of designated recyclable materials in each municipality, shall authorize municipalities that adopt a recycling ordinance pursuant to subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.1987, c.102 (C.13:1E-99.16) to limit the collection of designated recyclable materials to specified operating hours in order to preserve the peace and quiet in neighborhoods during the hours when most residents are asleep. d.    A district recycling plan may be modified to require that each municipality within the county revise the ordinance adopted pursuant to subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.1987, c.102 (C.13:1E-99.16) to provide for the source separation and collection of used dry cell batteries as a designated recyclable material. e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2008, c.130) (cf: P.L.2008, c.130, s.19) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), within one year, to develop a system of standardized labels, which identify recycling bins and containers according to the recyclable materials that the containers are intended to hold. The bill also requires each solid waste management district, within two years after the bill is enacted into law, to update its recycling plan to require that new recycling bins and containers distributed in the district be labeled in accordance with the system developed by the DEP.
