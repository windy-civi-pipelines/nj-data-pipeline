STATEMENT This bill provides veterans status to a veteran of any operation, mission or conflict during the global war on terror, including those who served in Operation Noble Eagle, in the United States or abroad. Under current law, only members of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom are veterans of the global war on terror.  Under current law, members of Noble Eagle or any other concurrent or subsequent operation, mission or conflict related to the global war on terror do not qualify.  This bill will include those persons. This bill amends several statutes that define "veteran" for the purposes of civil service hiring preferences, the purchase of service credit and the calculation of retirant benefits in the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) and Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF), for the purchase of service credit in the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), and for the receipt of a property tax deduction or exemption. Also, under this bill, the "in country" 14-day active service requirement  that limits the definition of veteran for some military engagements is supplemented with a minimum 90-day active military service requirement regardless of location, exclusive of any period (1) of assignment for a course of education or training which course was a continuation of a civilian course and was pursued to completion, or (2) as a cadet or midshipman at one of the service academies, or (3) of service performed pursuant to an enlistment in the Army National Guard or Air National Guard or in the Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, or Coast Guard Reserve, unless mobilized for active duty at the call of the President of the United States, provided, that any person receiving an actual, service-incurred injury or disability will be classed as a veteran, whether or not he has completed the 90 days' service as herein provided.  Consequently, active military service for at least 90 days performed anywhere, in whole or in part, during the dates for the specific engagements named will qualify a person as a "veteran" for the purposes of the statutes amended.  Thus, the bill will permit a greater number of individuals to receive the benefits specified.

STATEMENT This bill provides veterans status to a veteran of any operation, mission or conflict during the global war on terror, including those who served in Operation Noble Eagle, in the United States or abroad. Under current law, only members of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom are veterans of the global war on terror.  Under current law, members of Noble Eagle or any other concurrent or subsequent operation, mission or conflict related to the global war on terror do not qualify.  This bill will include those persons. This bill amends several statutes that define "veteran" for the purposes of civil service hiring preferences, the purchase of service credit and the calculation of retirant benefits in the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) and Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF), for the purchase of service credit in the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), and for the receipt of a property tax deduction or exemption. Also, under this bill, the "in country" 14-day active service requirement  that limits the definition of veteran for some military engagements is supplemented with a minimum 90-day active military service requirement regardless of location, exclusive of any period (1) of assignment for a course of education or training which course was a continuation of a civilian course and was pursued to completion, or (2) as a cadet or midshipman at one of the service academies, or (3) of service performed pursuant to an enlistment in the Army National Guard or Air National Guard or in the Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, or Coast Guard Reserve, unless mobilized for active duty at the call of the President of the United States, provided, that any person receiving an actual, service-incurred injury or disability will be classed as a veteran, whether or not he has completed the 90 days' service as herein provided.  Consequently, active military service for at least 90 days performed anywhere, in whole or in part, during the dates for the specific engagements named will qualify a person as a "veteran" for the purposes of the statutes amended.  Thus, the bill will permit a greater number of individuals to receive the benefits specified.
