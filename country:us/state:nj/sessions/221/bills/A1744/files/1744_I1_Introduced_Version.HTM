<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, only
members of Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom are veterans of the global war
on terror.  Under current law, members of Noble Eagle or any other concurrent
or subsequent operation, mission or conflict related to the global war on terror
do not qualify.  This bill will include those persons.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends several
statutes that define &quot;veteran&quot; for the purposes of civil service
hiring preferences, the purchase of service credit and the calculation of
retirant benefits in the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) and
Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF), for the purchase of service credit
in the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), and for the receipt of a
property tax deduction or exemption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Also, under this bill, the
&quot;in country&quot; 14-day active service requirement  that limits the
definition of veteran for some military engagements is supplemented with a
minimum 90-day active military service requirement regardless of location,
exclusive of any period (1) of assignment for a course of education or training
which course was a continuation of a civilian course and was pursued to
completion, or (2) as a cadet or midshipman at one of the service academies, or
(3) of service performed pursuant to an enlistment in the Army National Guard
or Air National Guard or in the Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve,
Marine Corps Reserve, or Coast Guard Reserve, unless mobilized for active duty
at the call of the President of the United States, provided, that any person
receiving an actual,<u> </u>service-incurred injury or disability will be
classed as a veteran, whether or not he has completed the 90 days' service as
herein provided.  Consequently, active military service for at least 90 days
performed anywhere, in whole or in part, during the dates for the specific
engagements named will qualify a person as a &quot;veteran&quot; for the
purposes of the statutes amended.  Thus, the bill will permit a greater number
of individuals to receive the benefits specified. </p>
