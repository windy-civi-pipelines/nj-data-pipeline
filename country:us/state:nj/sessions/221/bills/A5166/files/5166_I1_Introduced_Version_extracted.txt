Under the bill, in addition to any other disposition authorized by law, the court may impose a fine not to exceed $250,000 or five times the retail value of the contents of the package stolen from the residence seized at the time of the arrest, whichever is greater. Also, under the bill, in addition to the ordinary penalties for crimes of the third or second degree, the presumption of non-imprisonment for a person convicted of a first offense of a crime of the third degree would not apply.  Further, a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense is required to serve a mandatory minimum term of one-third to one-half of the sentence imposed, during which time the defendant shall not be eligible for parole.  The bill also provides that a person may be charged with residential package theft in addition to, or in combination with, any other crime such as home invasion burglary, residential burglary, or trespass, as applicable. Additionally, the bill establishes the Porch Theft Task Force to be led by the Attorney General, and involving State and local law enforcement and delivery companies.  The task force is required to track and reduce residential package thefts, centralize data collection concerning residential package thefts, and coordinate law enforcement efforts.
