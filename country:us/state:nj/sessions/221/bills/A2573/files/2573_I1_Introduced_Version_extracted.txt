(cf:  P.L.2019, c.364, s.9) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill would allow certain victims and family members to witness parole hearings.  Under current law, victims injured as a result of a crime of the first or second degree and the nearest relatives of murder victims are granted the opportunity to present a written or videotaped statement to be considered at parole hearings or to testify to the parole board at the time of the hearing.  This bill would extend the law to include a provision allowing these same victims and relatives to witness the entire proceedings of the parole hearing, regardless of whether they present a statement or testimony.
