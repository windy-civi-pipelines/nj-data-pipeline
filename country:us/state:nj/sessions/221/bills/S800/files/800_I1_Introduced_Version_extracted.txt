STATEMENT Under current law, State Police recruits are not sworn members of the New Jersey State Police until the recruits complete the required training and graduate from the New Jersey State Police Academy.  As a result, the death of a recruit cannot be classified as a death of a member and, therefore, death benefits cannot be provided to the survivors. This bill classifies the death of a State Police recruit who dies during required pre-servicing training, or complications therefrom, as a death in the line of duty and provides an accidental death benefit to the surviving spouse, surviving child, or surviving parent of the State Police recruit. Under the bill, the benefit paid to the surviving spouse must be at least $50,000. The bill provides that if there is no surviving spouse, a final compensation of at least $50,000 would be used to calculate the death benefit to the surviving child or surviving parent, as the case may be.
