The bill provides that textbooks must be sold in the same manner as ordered.  In the event that the product is unavailable as ordered, the bookstore, faculty member, and relevant publisher are required to work together to provide the best possible substitute that most closely matches the requested product, and the publisher must make available the price of the substitute. The bill also provides that no employee of a public institution of higher education may demand or receive any payment, loan, advance, goods, or deposit of money for adopting specific course materials required for coursework or instruction. The cost of attending public institutions of higher education continues to increase and many New Jersey students and their families find it difficult to afford the textbooks and materials that students are required to purchase for their courses.  The purpose of this bill is to promote open and transparent marketing, pricing and purchasing of textbooks to provide savings to students.
