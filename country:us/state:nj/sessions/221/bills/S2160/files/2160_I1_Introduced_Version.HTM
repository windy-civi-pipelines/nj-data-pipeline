R.S.33:1-12 is amended to read as follows:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     R.S.33:1-12.  Class C licenses
shall be subdivided and classified as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Plenary retail consumption
license. 1. The holder of this license shall be entitled, subject to rules and
regulations, to sell any alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed
premises by the glass or other open receptacle, and also to sell any alcoholic
beverages in original containers for consumption off the licensed premises; but
this license shall not be issued to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages in
or upon any premises in which a grocery, delicatessen, drug store or other
mercantile business is carried on, except as hereinafter provided.  The holder
of this license shall be permitted to conduct consumer wine, beer and spirits
tasting events and samplings for a fee or on a complimentary basis pursuant to
conditions established by rules and regulations of the Division of Alcoholic
Beverage Control, provided however, that the holder of this license complies
with the terms and conditions set forth in section 3 of P.L.2009, c.216
(C.33:1-12d).  Subject to such rules and regulations established from time to
time by the director, the holder of this license shall be permitted to sell
alcoholic beverages in or upon the premises in which any of the following is
carried on:  the keeping of a hotel or restaurant including the sale of
mercantile items incidental thereto as an accommodation to patrons; the sale,
at an entertainment facility as defined in R.S.33:1-1, having a seating
capacity for no less than 4,000 patrons, of mercantile items traditionally
associated with the type of event or program held at the site; the sale of
distillers', brewers' and vintners' packaged merchandise prepacked as a unit with
other suitable objects as gift items to be sold only as a unit; the sale of
novelty wearing apparel identified with the name of the establishment licensed
under the provisions of this section; the sale of cigars, cigarettes, packaged
crackers, chips, nuts and similar snacks and ice at retail as an accommodation
to patrons, or the retail sale of nonalcoholic beverages as accessory beverages
to alcoholic beverages; or, in commercial bowling establishments, the retail
sale or rental of bowling accessories and the retail sale from vending machines
of candy, ice cream and nonalcoholic beverages.  The fee for this license shall
be fixed by the governing board or body of the municipality in which the
licensed premises are situated, by ordinance, at not less than $250 and not
more than $2,500. No ordinance shall be enacted which shall raise or lower the
fee to be charged for this license by more than 20% from that charged in the
preceding license year or $500.00, whichever is the lesser.  The governing
board or body of each municipality may, by ordinance, enact that no plenary
retail consumption license shall be granted within its respective municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The holder of this license
shall be permitted to obtain a restricted brewery license issued pursuant to
subsection 1c. of R.S.33:1-10 and to operate a restricted brewery immediately
adjoining the licensed premises in accordance with the restrictions set forth
in that subsection.  All fees related to the issuance of both licenses shall be
paid in accordance with statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Seasonal retail consumption
license.  2. (1) The holder of this license shall be entitled, subject to rules
and regulations, to sell any alcoholic beverages for consumption on the
licensed premises by the glass or other open receptacle, and also to sell any
alcoholic beverages in original containers for consumption off the licensed
premises, during the summer season from May 1 until November 14, inclusive, or
during the winter season from November 15 until April 30, inclusive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In addition, the
director shall issue to the holder of this license, upon request by the
licensee, one-day permits that shall entitle the license holder to sell
alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed premises during the season
when the license holder is not authorized to sell alcoholic beverages pursuant
to subparagraph (1) of this subsection.  The number of one-day permits issued
to a licensee pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed an aggregate of 14
permits in one calendar year.  A one-day permit issued pursuant to this
subsection shall be valid for 24 consecutive hours.  The fee for each one-day
permit shall be $500. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The governing body of the
municipality in which the licensed premises is situated may place reasonable
conditions upon a one-day permit for the purpose of maintaining public safety
on the licensed premises and immediately surrounding area.  The costs
associated with the reasonable conditions placed on the one-day permit shall be
assumed by the holder of this license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   This license shall not
be issued to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages in or upon any premises in
which a grocery, delicatessen, drug store or other mercantile business is
carried on, except as hereinafter provided.  Subject to such rules and
regulations established from time to time by the director, the holder of this
license shall be permitted to sell alcoholic beverages in or upon the premises
in which any of the following is carried on:  the keeping of a hotel or
restaurant including the sale of mercantile items incidental thereto as an
accommodation to patrons; the sale of distillers', brewers' and vintners'
packaged merchandise prepacked as a unit with other suitable objects as gift
items to be sold only as a unit; the sale of novelty wearing apparel identified
with the name of the establishment licensed under the provisions of this
section; the sale of cigars, cigarettes, packaged crackers, chips, nuts and
similar snacks and ice at retail as an accommodation to patrons; or the retail
sale of nonalcoholic beverages as accessory beverages to alcoholic beverages.
The fee for this license shall be fixed by the governing board or body of the
municipality in which the licensed premises are situated, by ordinance, at 75%
of the fee fixed by said board or body for plenary retail consumption
licenses.  The governing board or body of each municipality may, by ordinance,
enact that no seasonal retail consumption license shall be granted within its
respective municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(4) A person who held this
license prior to the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the
Legislature as this bill) and wishes to exchange the license for a plenary
retail consumption license may surrender the license to the issuing authority,
who shall convert the license to a plenary retail consumption license.
Thereafter, the licensee may sell any alcoholic beverages during 12 months of
each year in accordance with the provisions of this section.  The governing
board or body of the municipality in which the licensed premises is situated shall
not prohibit the holder of this license from converting it in accordance with
this subsection or limit the licensee from exercising the same privileges as
