This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would create an Israel Evacuation Reimbursement Fund within the Department of State.  The monies in the Israel Evacuation Reimbursement Fund would be used by the Department of State to provide reimbursement to qualified New Jersey residents for travel costs incurred for the emergency evacuation from Israel due to the Israel-Hamas war. This bill also appropriates $2 million from the General Fund to the Department of State to implement the provisions of this bill. The Israel-Hamas conflict began on October 7, 2023 when Hamas terrorists launched a surprise multi-front attack against Israel.  Following the attack, more than 1,400 civilians were killed and approximately 240 others, including Americans, were kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages.  The current Israel-Hamas war is the deadliest Israeli-Palestinian conflict to date.  Under certain circumstances, the U.S. government may assist American citizens in emergency evacuations which if not made available, New Jersey residents may seek recourse from the State.
