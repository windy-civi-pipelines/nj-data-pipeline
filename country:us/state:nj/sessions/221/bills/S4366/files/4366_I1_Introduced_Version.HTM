The text of any emergency rule adopted by the division and the racing commission pursuant to this section shall be available in each racetrack, casino, sports wagering lounge, and simulcasting facility implementing the provisions of emergency rulemaking. c.     Any person employed on the effective date of this act, P.L.2018, c.33 (C.5:12A-10 et al.), by a permitholder in the admissions department or parimutuel clerk department of a racetrack operated by the permitholder shall be given a one-time right of first refusal offer of employment at the sports pool, including an online sports pool, that opens at that racetrack, for the then available positions of similar employment in that sports pool, or with any vendor contracting with the licensee to operate the sports pool.

STATEMENT This bill requires the Division of Gaming Enforcement in the Department of Law and Public Safety to arrange for the conduct of a study of the effectiveness of using various words and phrases in advertisements for casino games and sports pools to deter illegal or irresponsible gambling, challenge perceptions of gambling, and to encourage the use of responsible gambling tools.  The study will evaluate whether: (1)   certain words of phrases resonate with members of the public; (2)   certain words or phrases are more likely to cause persons engaged in gambling activities to bet responsibly; (3)   the placement of words and phrases in different locations on an advertisement may better draw the attention of viewers; (4)   the size of the font and any distinguishing features of the text, such as bold or underline, may emphasize the message for members of the public; (5)   the use of different messages would be more effective in reaching problem gamblers, persons on the list of self-excluded persons established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2001, c.39 (C.5:12-71.2), and persons under the legal age to gamble in this State; and (6)   the repeated use of the same words and phrases diminishes their effectiveness. The bill requires the study to be completed within 12 months and for the division to publish a copy of the study on its Internet website.  The division will then review and use this study as the basis for developing not less than three, but not more than 10 key words or phrases to be included in advertisements for casino games and sports pools, in addition to language already required such as "If you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800 GAMBLER."  These words and phrases will also be required to be used in advertisements at a frequency which optimizes their effectiveness.  The division may modify these words or phrases from time to time, as necessary to maintain their effectiveness. The bill also authorizes the division to adopt rules and regulations to prevent advertising and promotions, to the extent practicable, from being placed in or near locations, such as schools or college campuses, or on media which would predominantly target underage or other prohibited persons, including those on the list of self-excluded persons.
