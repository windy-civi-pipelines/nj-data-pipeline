FLYNN District 13 (Monmouth) Assemblyman  JAY WEBBER District 26 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Directs AG to investigate whether pedophile organizations use the internet to encourage sex offenders to violate State law. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution directing the Attorney General to investigate whether pedophile organizations use the internet to encourage sex offenders to violate State law. Whereas, The internet is currently being used as a forum for pedophile organizations to promote the legalization of consensual sexual relationships between adults and minors, particularly men and boys; and Whereas, Such organizations advance this agenda by maintaining web sites that actively recruit pedophiles to enroll as members; and Whereas, Use of the internet and other electronic means play a growing role in sex crimes committed against the youth, including the establishment of illegal sexual relationships between adults and minors; and Whereas, The sexual victimization of children is overwhelming in magnitude yet often undetected, and statistics show that one in five girls and one in ten boys are sexually exploited before they reach adulthood, yet less than 35% of those sexual assaults are reported to authorities; and Whereas, The State of New Jersey has enacted laws that establish the age at which an individual is legally competent to give consent to sexual intercourse, with the purpose of protecting children or minors from being sexually exploited by adults; and Whereas, Necessary precautions should be taken to ensure that pedophile organizations promoting an agenda to legalize consensual sexual relationships between adults and minors, are unable to use the internet as a means of influencing or encouraging sexual predators to violate the laws of this State; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Attorney General of the State of New Jersey is directed to investigate whether pedophile organizations, particularly organizations that promote the legalization of consensual sexual relationships between adults and minors, use the internet to encourage sex offenders to violate State law. 2.    The Attorney General shall report the results of the investigation to the Governor and the Legislature no later than one year following the effective date of this resolution. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution requires the Attorney General to undertake an investigation to determine whether certain pedophile organizations use the internet to encourage sex offenders to engage in sexual relationships that violate the laws of New Jersey.  The internet is being used as a forum for pedophile organizations that actively recruit members, and promote the abolition of all age-of-consent laws.  These organizations advocate the legalization of consensual sexual relationships between adults and minors, particularly men and boys.  Age-of-consent laws, however, are necessary to prevent sexual abuse, and to protect children from being sexually exploited by adults. Unfortunately, modes of electronic communication, such as the internet, play a significant role in sex crimes committed against children.  Necessary precautions should be taken to ensure that pedophile organizations are not using the internet to encourage sexual predators to violate the laws of this State.
