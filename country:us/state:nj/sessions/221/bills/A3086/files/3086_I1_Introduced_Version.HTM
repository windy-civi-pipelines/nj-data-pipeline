provisions in chapter 10 of Title 40A of the New Jersey Statutes, which permit
municipalities to offer group health insurance benefits to volunteer fire
fighters and emergency responders, and provisions in chapter 27A of Title 17B
of the New Jersey Statutes regarding small employer health benefits plans.  For
example, although N.J.S.40A:10-30 authorizes a municipality to provide group
health plans to volunteer firefighters, those volunteers are not considered
eligible employees under the small employer health benefits plan statutes. 
This bill clarifies that these volunteers, as well as emergency responders, may
be included in the group of eligible employees in municipalities regarded as
small employers, and thereby receive coverage under the same group plan.</span></p>
