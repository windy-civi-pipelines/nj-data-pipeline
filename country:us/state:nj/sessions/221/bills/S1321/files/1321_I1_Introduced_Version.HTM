redeem tax sale certificates, amending various parts of the statutory law, and
supplementing chapter 5 of Title 54 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  On May 25, 2023, the
United States Supreme Court issued a decision in a case before it, <u>Tyler v.
Hennepin County, Minnesota, et al.</u>, 143 S. Ct. 1369 (2023), that has very
important implications for the rights of all property owners, and specifically,
New Jersey law governing property taxes on real property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Ms. Geraldine Tyler owned a
condominium in Hennepin County, Minnesota on which accumulated approximately
$15,000 in unpaid real estate taxes, interest, and penalties.  The county
seized the condominium and sold it for $40,000.  Instead of returning the excess
$25,000 from the sale to Ms. Tyler, the county kept the money for itself as
permitted by that states law.  Ms. Tyler filed suit, alleging that the county
unconstitutionally retained the excess value of her condominium beyond the
$15,000 tax debt in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to
the United States Constitution, as well as the Excessive Fines Clause of the
Eighth Amendment.  In an opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts for a
unanimous Court, the Court found that Ms. Tyler had plausibly alleged a taking
under the Fifth Amendment.  Since Ms. Tyler agreed that relief under the
Takings Clause would fully remedy her harm, the Court did not decide whether
she also alleged an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment.  However, the acknowledgement
that Ms. Tyler had plausibly alleged a taking under the Fifth Amendment has the
effect of limiting what a lienholder can collect when a court forecloses the
right of redemption of a lien on the lienholders behalf to only the property
taxes paid by the lienholder, plus interest.  In the words of Chief Justice
Roberts, (t)he taxpayer must render unto Caesar what is Caesars, but no
more.  In this case, the party that kept the excess funds was a public entity,
not a private lienholder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  New Jerseys tax sale
law, R.S.54:5-1 et seq., allows the holder of a tax sale certificate, whether
it is a municipality or a private lienholder, the ability to foreclose the
right of the property owner to redeem the lien by paying to the tax sale
certificate holder all of the property taxes, plus interest, that the holder of
the tax sale certificate paid to the municipality.  Under R.S.54:5-86, an
action to foreclose the right of redemption of a tax lien is filed with the
Superior Court.  Under R.S.54:5-87, as part of the action to foreclose the
right of redemption, the court has the authority to adjudge an absolute and
indefeasible estate of inheritance in fee simple, to be vested in the
purchaser.  In other words, the Superior Court is authorized to grant title of
the property to the lienholder, without requiring the lienholder to return the
excess equity in the property to the prior owner.  This authority applies to
both municipalities, as lienholders, as well as to private lienholders.  The
language of R.S.54:5-85 reinforces this authority of the Superior Court: 
[t]he provisions of this article shall be liberally construed as remedial
legislation to encourage the barring of the right of redemption by actions in
the Superior Court to the end that marketable titles may thereby be secured. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The New Jersey
Constitution expressly extends property rights protections to actions taken by
private parties.  Article I, paragraph 20 of the constitution provides that private
property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.  That
paragraph goes on to provide that (i)ndividuals or private corporations shall
not be authorized to take private property for public use without just compensation
first made to the owners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  Case law reinforces the
provisions of Article I, paragraph 20.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  In <u>Hyde v. Somerset
Air Service, Inc.</u>, 1 N.J. Super.<span style='color:#1F497D'> </span><span
style='color:black'>346, 349-350 (Ch. Div. 1948), the court stated that . . .
in such cases it is a question of whats what rather than whos who.  Indeed,
the Legislature or governmental agencies cannot constitutionally confer upon
individuals or private corporations, acting primarily for their own profit,
although for public benefit as well, any right to deprive persons of the lawful
enjoyment of their property.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     (2) 
In <u>Oechsle v. Ruhl</u>, 140 N.J. Eq. 355, 360 (Ch. 1947), the court stated
that [a]n act of the legislature cannot confer any right upon an individual to
deprive persons of the ordinary enjoyment of their property without just
compensation.  This principle rests upon the express terms of the constitution
which created such a prohibition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     (3) 
In<u> Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. Angel</u>, 41 N.J. Eq. 316 (1886), the court
stated that [a]n act of the legislature cannot confer upon individuals or
private corporations, acting primarily for their own profit, although for
public benefit as well, any right to deprive persons of the ordinary enjoyment
of their property, except upon condition that just compensation be first made
to the owners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     (4) 
In <u>Tide-Water Company v. Coster</u>, 18 N.J. Eq. 518 (1866), the court
stated that [t]he legislative power is not competent to take the property of A
and transfer it to B, simply for the benefit or convenience of B, because such
an act has no public aspect; it concerns and affects, exclusively, the two
individuals.  In such case, it would be within the authority of the judiciary
to pronounce such transfer unconstitutional and void.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     In
each of these cases, the court reinforced the principle espoused in Article I,
paragraph 20 of the New Jersey Constitution that </span>(i)ndividuals or
private corporations shall not be authorized to take private property for
public use without just compensation first made to the owners.  The taking of
the entirety of a property owners equity in a parcel of real estate because
that property owner was delinquent in the payment of property taxes
attributable to the parcel of real property would appear to violate Article I,
paragraph 20 of New Jerseys Constitution as well as the Fifth Amendment of the
United States Constitution based on the reasoning set forth in <u>Tyler v.
Hennepin County, Minnesota, et. al.</u>.  Therefore, the Legislature has the
authority, and a legal obligation to end this practice, which has become
colloquially known and referred to as equity theft, and to require that any
excess equity in a parcel of real property that has been the subject of an
action in court to foreclose the right of redemption of a tax lien be returned
to the former property owner after the lienholder has been reimbursed for
property taxes paid, and interest due and owing, on the property during the
period in which the lienholder held the tax lien.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  Therefore, in order to
protect the equity of every property owner who may fall behind on their
property taxes, whether the tax lien is held by a municipality or by a private
lienholder, the Legislature has determined that, in light of the Supreme
Courts decision in <u>Tyler v. Hennepin County, Minnesota, et al.</u>, the tax
sale law shall be amended and supplemented in order to require that all equity
remaining after a lienholder, who has foreclosed the right of redemption of a
tax lien, has been reimbursed for property taxes paid, plus interest, shall be
returned to the delinquent property owner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would revise the
process governing an action filed in Superior Court by the holder of a tax lien
on a parcel of real property when that person institutes an action to foreclose
the right of redemption of the tax lien.  This bill is necessary because the
United States Supreme Courts holding in <u>Tyler v. Hennepin County, Minnesota,
et al.</u>, 143 S. Ct. 1369 (2023), has undermined the provision of New
Jerseys tax sale law which awards the holder of a tax sale certificate the
ability to foreclose the property owners right to redeem the tax lien and
awards the holder of the tax sale certificate the property itself, as well as
all of the property owners equity in the property.  The right of redemption of
a tax lien is the right of the owner of the property on which the tax lien
exists to repay the holder of the tax lien for the amount of taxes paid by the
lienholder, plus interest, and remove the lien from the property.  The
provisions of this bill are intended to address the unfairness of the loss of
that equity to property owners who lose property in a tax lien foreclosure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Ms. Geraldine Tyler owned a
condominium in Hennepin County, Minnesota on which accumulated approximately
$15,000 in unpaid real estate taxes, interest, and penalties.  The county
seized the condominium and sold it for $40,000.  Instead of returning the
excess $25,000 from the sale to Ms. Tyler, the county kept the money for
itself.  Ms. Tyler filed suit, alleging that the county unconstitutionally
retained the excess value of her condominium beyond the $15,000 tax debt in
violation of the Takings Clause of The Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution, as well as the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment. 
In an opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts for a unanimous Court, the Court
found that Ms. Tyler had plausibly alleged a taking under the Fifth Amendment. 
Since Ms. Tyler agreed that relief under the Takings Clause would fully remedy
her harm, the Court did not decide whether she also alleged an excessive fine
under the Fifth Amendment.  However, the acknowledgement that Ms. Tyler had
plausibly alleged a taking under the Fifth Amendment has the effect of limiting
what a lienholder can collect when the Court forecloses the right of redemption
of a lien on the lienholders behalf to only the property taxes paid by the
lienholder, plus interest.  In the words of Chief Justice Roberts, (t)he
taxpayer must render unto Caesar what is Caesars, but no more.  In this case,
the party that kept the excess funds was a public entity, not a private
lienholder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, under R.S.54:5-86,
with respect to a lienholder that is not a municipality, an action to foreclose
the right of redemption may be instituted at any time after the expiration of
the term of two years from the date of sale of the tax sale certificate.  In
the case of a municipality that holds a tax certificate, an action may be filed
at any time after 6 months from the date of the tax lien sale.  Once an action
to foreclose the right to redeem has been filed by a tax lien holder, the right
to redeem continues to exist until barred by the judgment of the Superior
Court.  However, upon the action by the judge to bar the right of redemption
and foreclose all liens other than municipal liens, the judge grants the holder
of the tax sale certificate the title to the property, and that person becomes
the owner of the property.  At this point, the previous owners rights to the
property are permanently extinguished and the previous owner also loses any
value, commonly referred to as equity, built up in the property through
appreciation, or the payoff of a mortgage</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, in the case of
a parcel of real property that is the subject of a tax lien foreclosure action
filed in Superior Court, upon the approval of the action to foreclose the right
of redemption by the Court, the Court would not grant the tax lien holder
ownership of the property.  Instead, the Court would order that all of the
property taxes paid by the tax lien holder, and interest due thereon, together
with all costs related to the filing and adjudication of the action to
foreclose the right of redemption that were paid by the tax lien holder, would
be the first priority lien on the property, paramount to any other lien,
including any outstanding municipal lien, and would order the sheriff of the
county in which the parcel of real property is located to hold an Internet
auction of the property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Once the Internet auction is
completed and the property has been sold, not later than 14 days following
receipt by the sheriff of the moneys paid by the winning bidder at the auction,
the sheriff would be required to forward to the tax lien holder the sum of all
property taxes paid by the tax lien holder, and interest due thereon, together
with all costs related to the filing and adjudication of the action to
foreclose the right of redemption.  The sheriff would be required to also pay
to the municipality the amount of any other municipal liens on the property
plus any interest due and owing thereon, and retain for the sheriffs office
sufficient funds to cover the costs of the auction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Once those payments are made,
the sheriff would then forward any remaining moneys collected from the winning
bidder of the auction to the defendant.  This allows the defendant to retain
funds to either purchase, or rent, another property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, with
respect to a property taxpayer who has paid down a mortgage, who has equity in
a property, or whose property has considerably appreciated over time, the loss
of the property in a tax lien foreclosure, as well as the loss of all of the
equity in the property, could lead to homelessness or other hardship, as there
are no funds returned to the property owner with which to rent, or to purchase,
another property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Property equity is a valuable
asset to property owners that should be protected, and retained by the property
owners.  It provides a property owner with opportunities to turn the equity to
cash to purchase or rent another property, or to pay for items like living
expenses in retirement, a childs college savings, or the health care of a
loved one.  Equity theft, as this practice is known colloquially, occurs when
government uses the property to settle an unpaid property tax debt and allow
someone other than the property owner to collect the excess revenue beyond the
unpaid property tax debt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Like other assets, home equity
should be protected from unjust government seizure.  New Jersey is one of a
handful of states, plus the District of Columbia, that does not currently,
following a tax lien foreclosure, return to a property owner the remaining
equity in the property subject to the tax lien foreclosure.</p>
