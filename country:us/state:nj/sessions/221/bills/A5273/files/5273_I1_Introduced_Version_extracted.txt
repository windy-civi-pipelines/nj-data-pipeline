When determining whether a patient was previously issued a prescription for, or used or was administered a drug or its pharmaceutical equivalent, the practitioner shall consult with the patient and review the patient's medical record and prescription monitoring information. "Opioid antidote" means any drug, regardless of dosage amount or method of administration, which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of an opioid overdose.  "Opioid antidote" includes, but is not limited to, naloxone hydrochloride, in any dosage amount, which is administered through nasal spray or any other FDA-approved means or methods.

(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, if a health care practitioner issues a prescription for an opioid drug which is a controlled dangerous substance to a patient, the prescriber shall additionally issue the patient a prescription for an opioid antidote if any of the following conditions is present: (a)   the patient has a history of substance use disorder; (b)  the prescription for the opioid drug is for a daily dose of more than 90 morphine milligram equivalents; or (c)   the patient holds a current, valid prescription for a benzodiazepine drug that is a Schedule III or Schedule IV controlled dangerous substance. (2) A practitioner shall not be required to issue more than one prescription for an opioid antidote to a patient under paragraph (1) of this subsection per year. (3) Nothing in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a practitioner from issuing additional prescriptions for an opioid antidote to a patient upon the patient's request or when the practitioner determines there is a clinical or practical need for the additional prescription. (cf: P.L.2023, c.177, s.57) 15.  (New section) The Commissioner of Human Services shall apply for such State plan amendments or waivers as may be necessary to implement the provisions of section 11 of this act and to secure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program. 16.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes the Graduate Physician Licensing Act. Under this bill, the State Board of Medical Examiners (board) will issue a license as a graduate physician to an applicant who, among other things:  1) is at least 18 years of age; 2) is a medical school graduate; 3) has successfully completed Step 2 of the physician licensing examination; 4) has not completed an approved postgraduate residency; and 5) has no criminal history.  Alternatively, the board may accept proof that an applicant holds a current graduate physician license in a state which has standards substantially equivalent to those of New Jersey. Graduate physicians will be authorized to provide primary care services in medically underserved areas of the State, subject to any restrictions set forth in a collaborative practice arrangement with a collaborating physician, who is responsible for supervising the graduate physician at all times.  The delivery of health care services is to be within the scope of practice of the graduate physician and consistent with that graduate physician's skill, training, and competence and the skill and training of the collaborating physician.  Graduate physicians may be delegated the authority to prescribe controlled dangerous substances and authorize patients for medical cannabis, subject to certain restrictions. This bill requires health benefits plans, the Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare programs, and the State Health Benefits Program and the School Employees Health Benefits Program, to reimburse a graduate physician for the diagnosis, consultation, or treatment of patients on the same basis that reimbursement is provided for the service when it is delivered by another comparable mid-level health provider including, but not limited to, a physician assistant.

Graduate physicians will be authorized to provide primary care services in medically underserved areas of the State, subject to any restrictions set forth in a collaborative practice arrangement with a collaborating physician, who is responsible for supervising the graduate physician at all times.  The delivery of health care services is to be within the scope of practice of the graduate physician and consistent with that graduate physician's skill, training, and competence and the skill and training of the collaborating physician.  Graduate physicians may be delegated the authority to prescribe controlled dangerous substances and authorize patients for medical cannabis, subject to certain restrictions. This bill requires health benefits plans, the Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare programs, and the State Health Benefits Program and the School Employees Health Benefits Program, to reimburse a graduate physician for the diagnosis, consultation, or treatment of patients on the same basis that reimbursement is provided for the service when it is delivered by another comparable mid-level health provider including, but not limited to, a physician assistant.
