S490 SENATE, No. 490 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  JAMES W. HOLZAPFEL District 10 (Monmouth and Ocean) SYNOPSIS Establishes training for law enforcement officers interacting with pregnant women. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning certain law enforcement interactions and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  The Department of Law and Public Safety shall develop or identify training course materials and an online tutorial for law enforcement officers concerning interaction with any pregnant woman who is in labor or preparing for delivery, and any person accompanying her if appropriate.  The training shall include: (1)   reviewing at the time of a motor vehicle stop any required documentation, such as a drivers license, registration, and proof of insurance, in the most efficient manner; (2)   assessing a motor vehicle stop to determine if emergency responders are to be requested, whether for assistance at the scene or for transport; and (3)   preparing for delivery of a baby or another childbirth emergency. b.    The Department of Law and Public Safety shall cause the training course materials and online tutorial developed or identified pursuant to subsection a. of this section to be made available to every State, county, and municipal law enforcement department in the State and to each campus police department at an institution of higher education in the State that appoints police officers pursuant to P.L.1970, c.211 (C.18A:6-4.2 et seq.) for use in providing officer training and information. 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires the Department of Law and Public Safety to develop or identify training course materials and an online tutorial for law enforcement officers concerning interaction with any pregnant woman who is in labor or preparing for delivery, and any person who might be accompanying her. The training would include: (1) reviewing at the time of a vehicle stop any required documentation, such as a drivers license, registration, and proof of insurance, in the most efficient manner; (2) assessing a vehicle stop to determine if emergency responders are to be requested, whether for assistance at the scene or for transport; and (3) preparing for delivery of a baby or another childbirth emergency. Under the bill, the department would develop or identify the training course materials and online tutorial, and make them available for use in providing officer training and information to every State, county, and municipal law enforcement department, as well as any campus police department at an institution of higher education. Recently, a Howell Police Department officer pulled over and issued a citation to a driver for speeding. The driver noted that his passenger was in labor and the two were driving to the hospital for delivery of their baby.  While speeding is risky, even in cases of medical emergencies, such as labor and childbirth, it is essential to consider roadway safety and law enforcement officers have a duty to protect all members of the public.  There are other recent instances of police officers unexpectedly assisting in the delivery of babies with minimal time to react. By providing law enforcement officers with training for handling these variable and unpredictable situations, officers will be better equipped to ensure the safety of all the citizens of this State.
