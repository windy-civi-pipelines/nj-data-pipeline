Under N.J.S.2C:2-2, a person acts recklessly when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk which exists or will result from his conduct.  The risk must be of such nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the persons conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would exercise in the same situation.
