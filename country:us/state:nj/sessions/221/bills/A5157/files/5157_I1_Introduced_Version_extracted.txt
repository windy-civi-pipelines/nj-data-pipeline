Any food service business that violates the bill's provisions would be liable to a warning for the first offense, a civil penalty of $2,500 for the second offense, and a civil penalty of $5,000 for the third and each subsequent offense, to be collected through a summary proceeding.  Each day on which a violation occurs would constitute a separate and distinct offense.  Any moneys collected from penalties imposed pursuant to the bill would be deposited into the "Clean Communities Program Fund" for use in financing litter pickup, removal, education, and enforcement programs at the State and local levels, except that municipalities and county environmental enforcement agencies would be permitted to retain 30 percent of the moneys. Finally, the bill would amend the law at P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.), which prohibits the distribution of plastic bags and polystyrene food serviceware, in order to provide for entities that are certified pursuant to the "County Environmental Health Act," P.L.1977, c.443 (C.26:3a2-21 et seq.),  to have primary enforcement responsibility under, and for the purposes of, that law.

(cf: P.L.2020, c.117, s.6) 6.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill would prohibit food service businesses in the State from providing customers with single-use utensils or condiments, except upon request. Specifically, the bill would provide that, commencing on the first day of the seventh month after the bill's enactment: (1) no food service business operating in the State may provide single-use utensils or condiments to any customer, except upon, and in accordance with, the express request of that customer; and (2) a food service business that has on-site seating capacity for 50 or more customers will be required to provide its on-site customers with easy access to reusable, washable utensils, which are to be returned to the food service business, upon completion of the on-site meal, for cleaning and reuse.  The bill would expressly provide, however, that:  (1) schools are to be exempted from the bills provisions for the first five years following the bills effective date; (2) food service businesses are to be exempted from the bills provisions for the first two years following the bills effective date; and (3) health care facilities are to be exempted from the bills provisions during any infectious disease outbreak, or during outdoor recreational activities or family picnics. Under the bills provisions, any food service business that elects to supply customers with single-use utensils or condiments, upon request, would be required to provide each customer with only those types and amounts of single-use utensils and condiments that have been expressly requested by the customer.  A food service business would also be prohibited from creating, acquiring, or providing customers with bundled utensil or condiment packages that contain more than one type of single-use plastic utensil or condiment. Any food service business that violates the bill's provisions would be liable to a warning for the first offense, a civil penalty of $2,500 for the second offense, and a civil penalty of $5,000 for the third and each subsequent offense, to be collected through a summary proceeding.  Each day on which a violation occurs would constitute a separate and distinct offense.  Any moneys collected from penalties imposed pursuant to the bill would be deposited into the "Clean Communities Program Fund" for use in financing litter pickup, removal, education, and enforcement programs at the State and local levels, except that municipalities and county environmental enforcement agencies would be permitted to retain 30 percent of the moneys. Finally, the bill would amend the law at P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.), which prohibits the distribution of plastic bags and polystyrene food serviceware, in order to provide for entities that are certified pursuant to the "County Environmental Health Act," P.L.1977, c.443 (C.26:3a2-21 et seq.),  to have primary enforcement responsibility under, and for the purposes of, that law.
