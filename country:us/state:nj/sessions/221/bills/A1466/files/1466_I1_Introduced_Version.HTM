<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1971,
c.60 (C.45:1-2.2) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.   All members of the
several professional boards and commissions shall be appointed by the Governor
in the manner prescribed by law; except in appointing members other than those
appointed pursuant to subsection b. or subsection c., the Governor shall give
due consideration to, but shall not be bound by, recommendations submitted by the
appropriate professional organizations of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In addition to the
membership otherwise prescribed by law, the Governor shall appoint in the same
manner as presently prescribed by law for the appointment of members, two
additional members to represent the interests of the public, to be known as
public members, to each of the following boards and commissions: the New Jersey
State Board of Accountancy, the New Jersey State Board of Architects, the New
Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling, the New Jersey State Board
of Dentistry, the State Board of Mortuary Science of New Jersey, the State
Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, the State Board of Medical
Examiners, the New Jersey Board of Nursing, the New Jersey State Board of
Optometrists, the State Board of Examiners of Ophthalmic Dispensers and
Ophthalmic Technicians, the Board of Pharmacy, the State Board of Professional
Planners, the State Board of Psychological Examiners, the New Jersey Real
Estate Commission, the State Board of Court Reporting, the State Board of
Social Work Examiners, the Elevator, Escalator, and Moving Walkway Mechanics
Licensing Board, and the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners, and one
additional public member to each of the following boards: the Board of
Examiners of Electrical Contractors, the State Board of Marriage and Family
Therapy Examiners, the State Board of Examiners of Master Plumbers, <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> the State
Real Estate Appraiser Board<u>, and the Landscape Professional License Review
Committee</u>. Each public member shall be appointed for the term prescribed
for the other members of the board or commission and until the appointment of
his successor.  Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term only. The
Governor may remove any such public member after hearing, for misconduct,
incompetency, neglect of duty or for any other sufficient cause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No public member appointed
pursuant to this section shall have any association or relationship with the
profession or a member thereof regulated by the board of which he is a member,
where such association or relationship would prevent such public member from
representing the interest of the public.  Such a relationship includes a
relationship with members of one's immediate family; and such association includes
membership in the profession regulated by the board.  To receive services
rendered in a customary client relationship will not preclude a prospective
public member from appointment.  This paragraph shall not apply to individuals
who are public members of boards on the effective date of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It shall be the responsibility
of the Attorney General to insure that no person with the aforementioned
association or relationship or any other questionable or potential conflict of
interest shall be appointed to serve as a public member of any board regulated
by this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Where a board is required to
examine the academic and professional credentials of an applicant for licensure
or to test such applicant orally, no public member appointed pursuant to this
section shall participate in such examination process; provided, however, that
public members shall be given notice of and may be present at all such
examination processes and deliberations concerning the results thereof, and,
provided further, that public members may participate in the development and
establishment of the procedures and criteria for such examination processes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Governor shall
designate a department in the Executive Branch of the State Government which is
closely related to the profession or occupation regulated by each of the boards
or commissions designated in section 1 of P.L.1971, c.60 (C.45:1-2.1) and shall
appoint the head of such department, or the holder of a designated office or
position in such department, to serve without compensation at the pleasure of
the Governor as a member of such board or commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A majority of the voting
members of such boards or commissions shall constitute a quorum thereof and no
action of any such board or commission shall be taken except upon the
affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the entire board or
commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2012, c.71, s.14)       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that landscape activities are a vital part of
New Jersey's economy, serve a vital role in the protection of New Jersey's
environment, and that professionally installed and maintained landscapes
enhance the public health, safety, and well-being of its residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature also finds
that New Jersey property owners and residents recognize the value of a
professionally developed and maintained landscape.  An attractive, healthy
landscape enriches the community, and enhances the quality of life for all in New
  Jersey.  It reflects positively on the people living and working in the State
and enhances property values.  A well-maintained and developed property is
important to providing a safe, high quality play area for children and pets.  A
properly developed and maintained landscape also contributes in a positive way
to overall air and water quality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
that there are no unified Statewide licensing requirements which would
encompass the full scope of professional landscape activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature therefore
determines that it is appropriate for the State to recognize New Jersey
licensed landscape professionals, encourage awareness of and compliance with
industry standards, promote safe landscape operations and protect the interests
of the public by preventing unqualified individuals or business from engaging
in landscape activities.</p>
