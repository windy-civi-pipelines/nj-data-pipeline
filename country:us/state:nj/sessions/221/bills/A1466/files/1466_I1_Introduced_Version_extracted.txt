CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the licensure of landscape professionals and the registration of professional landscaping businesses, amending P.L.1971, c.60 and P.L.2004, c.16, and supplementing Title 45 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.1971, c.60 (C.45:1-2.2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.   All members of the several professional boards and commissions shall be appointed by the Governor in the manner prescribed by law; except in appointing members other than those appointed pursuant to subsection b. or subsection c., the Governor shall give due consideration to, but shall not be bound by, recommendations submitted by the appropriate professional organizations of this State. b.    In addition to the membership otherwise prescribed by law, the Governor shall appoint in the same manner as presently prescribed by law for the appointment of members, two additional members to represent the interests of the public, to be known as public members, to each of the following boards and commissions: the New Jersey State Board of Accountancy, the New Jersey State Board of Architects, the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling, the New Jersey State Board of Dentistry, the State Board of Mortuary Science of New Jersey, the State Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, the State Board of Medical Examiners, the New Jersey Board of Nursing, the New Jersey State Board of Optometrists, the State Board of Examiners of Ophthalmic Dispensers and Ophthalmic Technicians, the Board of Pharmacy, the State Board of Professional Planners, the State Board of Psychological Examiners, the New Jersey Real Estate Commission, the State Board of Court Reporting, the State Board of Social Work Examiners, the Elevator, Escalator, and Moving Walkway Mechanics Licensing Board, and the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners, and one additional public member to each of the following boards: the Board of Examiners of Electrical Contractors, the State Board of Marriage and Family Therapy Examiners, the State Board of Examiners of Master Plumbers, [and] the State Real Estate Appraiser Board, and the Landscape Professional License Review Committee. Each public member shall be appointed for the term prescribed for the other members of the board or commission and until the appointment of his successor.  Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term only. The Governor may remove any such public member after hearing, for misconduct, incompetency, neglect of duty or for any other sufficient cause. No public member appointed pursuant to this section shall have any association or relationship with the profession or a member thereof regulated by the board of which he is a member, where such association or relationship would prevent such public member from representing the interest of the public.  Such a relationship includes a relationship with members of one's immediate family; and such association includes membership in the profession regulated by the board.  To receive services rendered in a customary client relationship will not preclude a prospective public member from appointment.  This paragraph shall not apply to individuals who are public members of boards on the effective date of this act. It shall be the responsibility of the Attorney General to insure that no person with the aforementioned association or relationship or any other questionable or potential conflict of interest shall be appointed to serve as a public member of any board regulated by this section. Where a board is required to examine the academic and professional credentials of an applicant for licensure or to test such applicant orally, no public member appointed pursuant to this section shall participate in such examination process; provided, however, that public members shall be given notice of and may be present at all such examination processes and deliberations concerning the results thereof, and, provided further, that public members may participate in the development and establishment of the procedures and criteria for such examination processes. c.     The Governor shall designate a department in the Executive Branch of the State Government which is closely related to the profession or occupation regulated by each of the boards or commissions designated in section 1 of P.L.1971, c.60 (C.45:1-2.1) and shall appoint the head of such department, or the holder of a designated office or position in such department, to serve without compensation at the pleasure of the Governor as a member of such board or commission. d.    A majority of the voting members of such boards or commissions shall constitute a quorum thereof and no action of any such board or commission shall be taken except upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the entire board or commission. (cf: P.L.2012, c.71, s.14) 2.    Section 5 of P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-140) is amended to read as follows: 5.    The provisions of this act shall not apply to: a.     any person required to register pursuant to "The New Home Warranty and Builders' Registration Act," P.L.1977, c.467 (C.46:3B-1 et seq.); b.    any person performing a home improvement upon a residential or non-commercial property he owns, or that is owned by a member of his family, a bona fide charity, or other non-profit organization; c.     any person regulated by the State as an architect, professional engineer, landscape architect, land surveyor, electrical contractor, master plumber, or any other person in any other related profession requiring registration, certification, or licensure by the State, who is acting within the scope of practice of his profession; d.    any person who is employed by a community association or cooperative corporation; e.     any public utility as defined under R.S.48:2-13; f.     any person licensed under the provisions of section 16 of P.L.1960, c.41 (C.17:16C-77); [and] g.    any home improvement retailer with a net worth of more than $50,000,000, or employee of that retailer; and h.    any person licensed as a landscape professional under the provisions of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2004, c.16, s.5) 3.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that landscape activities are a vital part of New Jersey's economy, serve a vital role in the protection of New Jersey's environment, and that professionally installed and maintained landscapes enhance the public health, safety, and well-being of its residents. The Legislature also finds that New Jersey property owners and residents recognize the value of a professionally developed and maintained landscape.  An attractive, healthy landscape enriches the community, and enhances the quality of life for all in New Jersey.  It reflects positively on the people living and working in the State and enhances property values.  A well-maintained and developed property is important to providing a safe, high quality play area for children and pets.  A properly developed and maintained landscape also contributes in a positive way to overall air and water quality. The Legislature further finds that there are no unified Statewide licensing requirements which would encompass the full scope of professional landscape activities. The Legislature therefore determines that it is appropriate for the State to recognize New Jersey licensed landscape professionals, encourage awareness of and compliance with industry standards, promote safe landscape operations and protect the interests of the public by preventing unqualified individuals or business from engaging in landscape activities. 4.    (New section)  As used in this act: "Advertise" means to communicate to the public by means of any print, electronic or any other media, including, but not limited to, newspapers, magazines, periodicals, journals, directories, books, circulars, flyers, business cards, signs, radio, telephone, facsimile machine, television, computer, vehicle signage, or the Internet. Board means the New Jersey State Board of Architects.

A1466 ASSEMBLY, No. 1466 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  ROBERT J. KARABINCHAK District 18 (Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Provides for licensure of landscape professionals and registration of professional landscaping businesses. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the licensure of landscape professionals and the registration of professional landscaping businesses, amending P.L.1971, c.60 and P.L.2004, c.16, and supplementing Title 45 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.1971, c.60 (C.45:1-2.2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.   All members of the several professional boards and commissions shall be appointed by the Governor in the manner prescribed by law; except in appointing members other than those appointed pursuant to subsection b. or subsection c., the Governor shall give due consideration to, but shall not be bound by, recommendations submitted by the appropriate professional organizations of this State. b.    In addition to the membership otherwise prescribed by law, the Governor shall appoint in the same manner as presently prescribed by law for the appointment of members, two additional members to represent the interests of the public, to be known as public members, to each of the following boards and commissions: the New Jersey State Board of Accountancy, the New Jersey State Board of Architects, the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling, the New Jersey State Board of Dentistry, the State Board of Mortuary Science of New Jersey, the State Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors, the State Board of Medical Examiners, the New Jersey Board of Nursing, the New Jersey State Board of Optometrists, the State Board of Examiners of Ophthalmic Dispensers and Ophthalmic Technicians, the Board of Pharmacy, the State Board of Professional Planners, the State Board of Psychological Examiners, the New Jersey Real Estate Commission, the State Board of Court Reporting, the State Board of Social Work Examiners, the Elevator, Escalator, and Moving Walkway Mechanics Licensing Board, and the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners, and one additional public member to each of the following boards: the Board of Examiners of Electrical Contractors, the State Board of Marriage and Family Therapy Examiners, the State Board of Examiners of Master Plumbers, [and] the State Real Estate Appraiser Board, and the Landscape Professional License Review Committee. Each public member shall be appointed for the term prescribed for the other members of the board or commission and until the appointment of his successor.  Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term only. The Governor may remove any such public member after hearing, for misconduct, incompetency, neglect of duty or for any other sufficient cause. No public member appointed pursuant to this section shall have any association or relationship with the profession or a member thereof regulated by the board of which he is a member, where such association or relationship would prevent such public member from representing the interest of the public.  Such a relationship includes a relationship with members of one's immediate family; and such association includes membership in the profession regulated by the board.  To receive services rendered in a customary client relationship will not preclude a prospective public member from appointment.  This paragraph shall not apply to individuals who are public members of boards on the effective date of this act. It shall be the responsibility of the Attorney General to insure that no person with the aforementioned association or relationship or any other questionable or potential conflict of interest shall be appointed to serve as a public member of any board regulated by this section. Where a board is required to examine the academic and professional credentials of an applicant for licensure or to test such applicant orally, no public member appointed pursuant to this section shall participate in such examination process; provided, however, that public members shall be given notice of and may be present at all such examination processes and deliberations concerning the results thereof, and, provided further, that public members may participate in the development and establishment of the procedures and criteria for such examination processes. c.     The Governor shall designate a department in the Executive Branch of the State Government which is closely related to the profession or occupation regulated by each of the boards or commissions designated in section 1 of P.L.1971, c.60 (C.45:1-2.1) and shall appoint the head of such department, or the holder of a designated office or position in such department, to serve without compensation at the pleasure of the Governor as a member of such board or commission. d.    A majority of the voting members of such boards or commissions shall constitute a quorum thereof and no action of any such board or commission shall be taken except upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the entire board or commission. (cf: P.L.2012, c.71, s.14) 2.    Section 5 of P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-140) is amended to read as follows: 5.    The provisions of this act shall not apply to: a.     any person required to register pursuant to "The New Home Warranty and Builders' Registration Act," P.L.1977, c.467 (C.46:3B-1 et seq.); b.    any person performing a home improvement upon a residential or non-commercial property he owns, or that is owned by a member of his family, a bona fide charity, or other non-profit organization; c.     any person regulated by the State as an architect, professional engineer, landscape architect, land surveyor, electrical contractor, master plumber, or any other person in any other related profession requiring registration, certification, or licensure by the State, who is acting within the scope of practice of his profession; d.    any person who is employed by a community association or cooperative corporation; e.     any public utility as defined under R.S.48:2-13; f.     any person licensed under the provisions of section 16 of P.L.1960, c.41 (C.17:16C-77); [and] g.    any home improvement retailer with a net worth of more than $50,000,000, or employee of that retailer; and h.    any person licensed as a landscape professional under the provisions of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2004, c.16, s.5) 3.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that landscape activities are a vital part of New Jersey's economy, serve a vital role in the protection of New Jersey's environment, and that professionally installed and maintained landscapes enhance the public health, safety, and well-being of its residents. The Legislature also finds that New Jersey property owners and residents recognize the value of a professionally developed and maintained landscape.  An attractive, healthy landscape enriches the community, and enhances the quality of life for all in New Jersey.  It reflects positively on the people living and working in the State and enhances property values.  A well-maintained and developed property is important to providing a safe, high quality play area for children and pets.  A properly developed and maintained landscape also contributes in a positive way to overall air and water quality. The Legislature further finds that there are no unified Statewide licensing requirements which would encompass the full scope of professional landscape activities. The Legislature therefore determines that it is appropriate for the State to recognize New Jersey licensed landscape professionals, encourage awareness of and compliance with industry standards, promote safe landscape operations and protect the interests of the public by preventing unqualified individuals or business from engaging in landscape activities. 4.    (New section)  As used in this act: "Advertise" means to communicate to the public by means of any print, electronic or any other media, including, but not limited to, newspapers, magazines, periodicals, journals, directories, books, circulars, flyers, business cards, signs, radio, telephone, facsimile machine, television, computer, vehicle signage, or the Internet. Board means the New Jersey State Board of Architects.
