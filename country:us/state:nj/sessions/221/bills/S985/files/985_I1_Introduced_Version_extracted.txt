S985 SENATE, No. 985 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  LINDA R. GREENSTEIN District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) Senator  TROY SINGLETON District 7 (Burlington) SYNOPSIS Establishes green infrastructure financing program. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act establishing a green infrastructure financing program, supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.1974, c.80. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  a.  The Legislature finds that: (1)   Building New Jersey's clean energy infrastructure at the lowest possible cost is vital to the State reaching its clean energy goals; (2)   Significant investment in infrastructure installations is required to achieve the State's goals of energy self-sufficiency, energy security, and energy diversification and to support the achievement of the renewable energy portfolio standards and energy efficiency and conservation program requirements; (3)   These green infrastructure investments support New Jersey's evolving energy market and ecosystem and provide affordable energy options for all of New Jersey's consumers.  Green infrastructure installations require significant amounts of capital and it is in the public interest to minimize these costs.  A key component to minimizing costs is reducing the cost of capital required to finance green infrastructure installations; (4)   The upfront costs of green infrastructure equipment are a barrier preventing many electric and gas public utility customers from investing in green infrastructure.  Existing programs and incentives do not serve the entire spectrum of the customer market, particularly those customers who lack access to capital or who cannot afford the large upfront costs required to install and use green infrastructure, thus creating an underserved market; and (5)   A green infrastructure financing program, administered by the State, that capitalizes on electric and gas public utility customer contributions for green infrastructure equipment would serve a critical role in ensuring these customers receive the greatest opportunity for affordable and clean energy. b.    The Legislature further finds that the State would be best served by a State-administered green infrastructure financing program that: (1)   Focuses on providing low-cost financing as an alternative means to traditional financing for green infrastructure equipment for New Jerseys electric and gas public utility customers, particularly those customers not able to obtain green technology on reasonable financing terms, including those electric and gas public utility customers receiving a loan from the loan program paying a fee their monthly bills instead of a large up-front payment for the cost of the equipment; (2)   Establishes clearly defined program procedures and targets that encourage effective coordination among State agencies, industry, investors, and other critical energy industry stakeholders in order to help the State achieve its clean energy goals and to provide customers affordable energy options; and (3)   Utilizes loan program repayment funds as a funding source to finance additional green infrastructure installations, subject to regulatory guidelines and approval of the program. c.     The Legislature further finds that the impact and reach of the Board of Public Utilities existing clean energy financing programs can be greatly enhanced through the use of low-cost capital made available through the green infrastructure financing program established by P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). d.    The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the public interest to make cost-effective green infrastructure equipment options accessible and affordable to electric and gas public utility customers in an equitable way.  The manner in which to implement this goal is to establish a regulatory financing structure that authorizes the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, in cooperation with the Board of Public Utilities, to acquire and provide alternative low-cost financing to be deployed through a financing program to make green infrastructure installations accessible and affordable for New Jerseys electric and gas public utility customers, achieve measurable cost savings, and achieve this State's clean energy goals. 2.    (New section) As used in P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): "Ancillary agreement" means any bond insurance policy, letter of credit, reserve account, surety bond, swap arrangement, hedging arrangement, liquidity or credit support arrangement, or other related bond document or other similar agreement or arrangement, entered into in connection with, the issuance of green infrastructure bonds pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), that is designed to promote the credit quality and marketability of green infrastructure bonds or to mitigate the risk of an increase in interest rates.

paid in full, the green infrastructure fee authorized under any financing order shall be non-bypassable.  Subject to any exceptions provided in a financing order, the green infrastructure fee shall be paid by public utility customers receiving a loan from the loan program. d.    The green infrastructure fee shall be collected by a public utility as a collection agent for the authority or the financing parties, in full through a surcharge, fee, or charge that is separate and apart from the public utility's rates. e.     A public utility shall not have any ownership or beneficial interest in or any claim or right to the green infrastructure fee, green infrastructure property, or green infrastructure equipment, other than the obligation to bill and collect the green infrastructure fee as agent for the authority or any financing party and remit the collected revenue to the authority or such financing party entitled to receive those surcharges in accordance with the financing order.  The board shall ensure that all reasonable costs incurred by a public utility to implement the green infrastructure fee may be recovered as part of the public utility's revenue requirement, including necessary billing system adjustments, costs arising out of the billing and collection of the green infrastructure fee, and any costs for the green infrastructure fee that are not recovered otherwise.  The green infrastructure fee or green infrastructure property shall not be considered revenue of any public utility. f.     The obligation of any public utility customer subject to the green infrastructure fee to pay the green infrastructure fee and, notwithstanding subsection b. of this section, the obligation of the public utility to collect and remit the green infrastructure fee shall not be subject to any setoff, counterclaim, surcharge, or defense by the public utility or by any public utility customer, or in connection with a bankruptcy of any public utility or any public utility customer. 12.  (New section) Any successor public utility to a public utility subject to a financing order shall be bound by the requirements of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before

section)  a.  The ownership, transfer, and pledge of the green infrastructure fee and green infrastructure property and the imposition, charging, collection, and receipt of the green infrastructure fee are exempt from all taxes, fees, charges, and assessments imposed pursuant to State law. b.    Green infrastructure bonds issued under a financing order shall not be an obligation of any public utility.  The issuance of green infrastructure bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the public utility for payment of the principal of or interest on the green infrastructure bonds. 14.  (New section) a.  The State hereby pledges to and agrees with the green infrastructure bondholders and any financing party under a financing order that the State will not take or permit any action that impairs the value of green infrastructure property under the financing order, or reduce, alter, or impair the green infrastructure fee that is imposed, charged, collected, or remitted for the benefit of the green infrastructure bondholders and any financing party, until any principal, interest, and redemption premium in respect of green infrastructure bonds, all financing costs, and all moneys to be paid to a financing party under an ancillary agreement are paid or performed in full or unless adequate provision has been made by law for the protection of green infrastructure bondholders and any other financing party. b.    In issuing the green infrastructure bonds, the authority may include the pledge specified in subsection a. of this section in the green infrastructure

STATEMENT This bill establishes a regulatory financing structure that authorizes New Jersey Economic Development Authority (authority), in conjunction with the Board of Public Utilities (board), to acquire and provide low-cost financing, to be deployed through a financing program to make green infrastructure equipment and installations accessible and affordable for New Jerseys electric and gas public utility (utility) customers desiring financing for this purpose, achieve measurable cost savings, and attain the State's clean energy goals.  Green infrastructure equipment is infrastructure improvements, equipment, and personal property to be installed to deploy clean energy technology, demand response technology, and energy use reduction and demand side management infrastructure. Specifically, the bill: 1) establishes a green infrastructure loan program (loan program) for the purpose of acquiring and providing alternative low-cost financing for green infrastructure equipment and installations accessible and affordable for utility customers, through a financing program administered by the authority, and may include loans made to private entities who may lease or provide green infrastructure equipment to utility customers, as well as direct loans to utility customers, on terms approved by the authority; 2) authorizes the creation of green infrastructure property consisting of all property, rights, and interests of the loan program, which shall vest in the authority for the purpose of securing bond amounts payable under the loan program, and other financing costs; 3) establishes a green infrastructure fee, a non-bypassable bill fee imposed on and collected from those utility customers receiving a loan made to finance the purchase or installation of green infrastructure equipment on the property enhanced by the equipment under the loan program and, if there is an outstanding obligation on the loan, that obligation is to be transferred to the new property owner; 4) authorizes the authority to issue revenue bonds to finance the loan program; 5) establishes a green infrastructure fund to be administered by the authority and to receive the proceeds of the green infrastructure fee, green infrastructure property, the loan program and other monies expended on the operations of the loan program, including through credits to utility customers subject to the green infrastructure fee for reimbursement of excess green infrastructure fees collected; and 6) authorizes the authority to issue up to $200,000,000 in revenue bonds to establish and administer the loan program. Up-front costs of green infrastructure equipment are a barrier preventing many utility customers from investing in these installations and thereby achieving lower energy costs. Existing programs may not serve the entire spectrum of New Jerseys energy market, particularly those utility customers who lack access to capital or who cannot afford these up-front costs, thereby creating an underserved market.  This measure will establish a means of acquiring and providing alternative low-cost financing to underserved markets, enabling the installation of green infrastructure equipment in those markets. Significant investment in green infrastructure equipment will help the State achieve its goals of energy self-sufficiency and greater energy security and diversification, support its efforts to meet the States renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency requirements as its energy market is evolving, and provide affordable and accessible energy options for New Jersey utility customers.

S985 SENATE, No. 985 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  LINDA R. GREENSTEIN District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) Senator  TROY SINGLETON District 7 (Burlington) SYNOPSIS Establishes green infrastructure financing program. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act establishing a green infrastructure financing program, supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.1974, c.80. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  a.  The Legislature finds that: (1)   Building New Jersey's clean energy infrastructure at the lowest possible cost is vital to the State reaching its clean energy goals; (2)   Significant investment in infrastructure installations is required to achieve the State's goals of energy self-sufficiency, energy security, and energy diversification and to support the achievement of the renewable energy portfolio standards and energy efficiency and conservation program requirements; (3)   These green infrastructure investments support New Jersey's evolving energy market and ecosystem and provide affordable energy options for all of New Jersey's consumers.  Green infrastructure installations require significant amounts of capital and it is in the public interest to minimize these costs.  A key component to minimizing costs is reducing the cost of capital required to finance green infrastructure installations; (4)   The upfront costs of green infrastructure equipment are a barrier preventing many electric and gas public utility customers from investing in green infrastructure.  Existing programs and incentives do not serve the entire spectrum of the customer market, particularly those customers who lack access to capital or who cannot afford the large upfront costs required to install and use green infrastructure, thus creating an underserved market; and (5)   A green infrastructure financing program, administered by the State, that capitalizes on electric and gas public utility customer contributions for green infrastructure equipment would serve a critical role in ensuring these customers receive the greatest opportunity for affordable and clean energy. b.    The Legislature further finds that the State would be best served by a State-administered green infrastructure financing program that: (1)   Focuses on providing low-cost financing as an alternative means to traditional financing for green infrastructure equipment for New Jerseys electric and gas public utility customers, particularly those customers not able to obtain green technology on reasonable financing terms, including those electric and gas public utility customers receiving a loan from the loan program paying a fee their monthly bills instead of a large up-front payment for the cost of the equipment; (2)   Establishes clearly defined program procedures and targets that encourage effective coordination among State agencies, industry, investors, and other critical energy industry stakeholders in order to help the State achieve its clean energy goals and to provide customers affordable energy options; and (3)   Utilizes loan program repayment funds as a funding source to finance additional green infrastructure installations, subject to regulatory guidelines and approval of the program. c.     The Legislature further finds that the impact and reach of the Board of Public Utilities existing clean energy financing programs can be greatly enhanced through the use of low-cost capital made available through the green infrastructure financing program established by P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). d.    The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the public interest to make cost-effective green infrastructure equipment options accessible and affordable to electric and gas public utility customers in an equitable way.  The manner in which to implement this goal is to establish a regulatory financing structure that authorizes the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, in cooperation with the Board of Public Utilities, to acquire and provide alternative low-cost financing to be deployed through a financing program to make green infrastructure installations accessible and affordable for New Jerseys electric and gas public utility customers, achieve measurable cost savings, and achieve this State's clean energy goals. 2.    (New section) As used in P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): "Ancillary agreement" means any bond insurance policy, letter of credit, reserve account, surety bond, swap arrangement, hedging arrangement, liquidity or credit support arrangement, or other related bond document or other similar agreement or arrangement, entered into in connection with, the issuance of green infrastructure bonds pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), that is designed to promote the credit quality and marketability of green infrastructure bonds or to mitigate the risk of an increase in interest rates. "Authority" means the New Jersey Economic Development Authority established by section 4 of P.L.1974, c.80 (C.34:1B-4). "Board" means the Board of Public Utilities or any successor agency. "Clean energy technology" means any commercially available technology that enables the State to meet its renewable energy portfolio standards or any energy efficiency or conservation program requirements, demand response technology or energy use reduction or demand-side management infrastructure, programs, and services and approved by a board rule or order.

(cf: P.L.2010, c.28, s.3) 23.  This act shall take effect immediately, but shall remain inoperative for 60 days following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill establishes a regulatory financing structure that authorizes New Jersey Economic Development Authority (authority), in conjunction with the Board of Public Utilities (board), to acquire and provide low-cost financing, to be deployed through a financing program to make green infrastructure equipment and installations accessible and affordable for New Jerseys electric and gas public utility (utility) customers desiring financing for this purpose, achieve measurable cost savings, and attain the State's clean energy goals.  Green infrastructure equipment is infrastructure improvements, equipment, and personal property to be installed to deploy clean energy technology, demand response technology, and energy use reduction and demand side management infrastructure. Specifically, the bill: 1) establishes a green infrastructure loan program (loan program) for the purpose of acquiring and providing alternative low-cost financing for green infrastructure equipment and installations accessible and affordable for utility customers, through a financing program administered by the authority, and may include loans made to private entities who may lease or provide green infrastructure equipment to utility customers, as well as direct loans to utility customers, on terms approved by the authority; 2) authorizes the creation of green infrastructure property consisting of all property, rights, and interests of the loan program, which shall vest in the authority for the purpose of securing bond amounts payable under the loan program, and other financing costs; 3) establishes a green infrastructure fee, a non-bypassable bill fee imposed on and collected from those utility customers receiving a loan made to finance the purchase or installation of green infrastructure equipment on the property enhanced by the equipment under the loan program and, if there is an outstanding obligation on the loan, that obligation is to be transferred to the new property owner; 4) authorizes the authority to issue revenue bonds to finance the loan program; 5) establishes a green infrastructure fund to be administered by the authority and to receive the proceeds of the green infrastructure fee, green infrastructure property, the loan program and other monies expended on the operations of the loan program, including through credits to utility customers subject to the green infrastructure fee for reimbursement of excess green infrastructure fees collected; and 6) authorizes the authority to issue up to $200,000,000 in revenue bonds to establish and administer the loan program. Up-front costs of green infrastructure equipment are a barrier preventing many utility customers from investing in these installations and thereby achieving lower energy costs. Existing programs may not serve the entire spectrum of New Jerseys energy market, particularly those utility customers who lack access to capital or who cannot afford these up-front costs, thereby creating an underserved market.  This measure will establish a means of acquiring and providing alternative low-cost financing to underserved markets, enabling the installation of green infrastructure equipment in those markets. Significant investment in green infrastructure equipment will help the State achieve its goals of energy self-sufficiency and greater energy security and diversification, support its efforts to meet the States renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency requirements as its energy market is evolving, and provide affordable and accessible energy options for New Jersey utility customers.
