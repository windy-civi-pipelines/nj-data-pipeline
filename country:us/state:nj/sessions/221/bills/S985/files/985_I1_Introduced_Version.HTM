program, supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.1974,
c.80.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  a.  The
Legislature finds that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Building New
   Jersey's clean energy infrastructure at the lowest possible cost is vital to
the State reaching its clean energy goals;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Significant investment
in infrastructure installations is required to achieve the State's goals of
energy self-sufficiency, energy security, and energy diversification and to
support the achievement of the renewable energy portfolio standards and energy
efficiency and conservation program requirements;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   These green
infrastructure investments support New Jersey's evolving energy market and
ecosystem and provide affordable energy options for all of New
   Jersey's consumers.  Green infrastructure installations require significant
amounts of capital and it is in the public interest to minimize these costs.  A
key component to minimizing costs is reducing the cost of capital required to
finance green infrastructure installations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The upfront costs of
green infrastructure equipment are a barrier preventing many electric and gas
public utility customers from investing in green infrastructure.  Existing
programs and incentives do not serve the entire spectrum of the customer
market, particularly those customers who lack access to capital or who cannot afford
the large upfront costs required to install and use green infrastructure, thus
creating an underserved market; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   A green infrastructure
financing program, administered by the State, that capitalizes on electric and
gas public utility customer contributions for green infrastructure equipment
would serve a critical role in ensuring these customers receive the greatest
opportunity for affordable and clean energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Legislature further
finds that the State would be best served by a State-administered green
infrastructure financing program that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Focuses on providing
low-cost financing as an alternative means to traditional financing for green
infrastructure equipment for New Jerseys electric and gas public utility
customers, particularly those customers not able to obtain green technology on
reasonable financing terms, including those electric and gas public utility
customers receiving a loan from the loan program paying a fee their monthly
bills instead of a large up-front payment for the cost of the equipment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Establishes clearly
defined program procedures and targets that encourage effective coordination
among State agencies, industry, investors, and other critical energy industry
stakeholders in order to help the State achieve its clean energy goals and to
provide customers affordable energy options; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Utilizes loan program
repayment funds as a funding source to finance additional green infrastructure
installations, subject to regulatory guidelines and approval of the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Legislature further
finds that the impact and reach of the Board of Public Utilities existing
clean energy financing programs can be greatly enhanced through the use of
low-cost capital made available through the green infrastructure financing program
established by P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as
this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Legislature
therefore determines that it is in the public interest to make cost-effective
green infrastructure equipment options accessible and affordable to electric
and gas public utility customers in an equitable way.  The manner in which to
implement this goal is to establish a regulatory financing structure that
authorizes the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, in cooperation with the
Board of Public Utilities, to acquire and provide alternative low-cost
financing to be deployed through a financing program to make green
infrastructure installations accessible and affordable for New Jerseys
electric and gas public utility customers, achieve measurable cost savings, and
achieve this State's clean energy goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section) As used in
P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Ancillary
agreement&quot; means any bond insurance policy, letter of credit, reserve
account, surety bond, swap arrangement, hedging arrangement, liquidity or
credit support arrangement, or other related bond document or other similar
agreement or arrangement, entered into in connection with, the issuance of
green infrastructure bonds pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill), that is designed to promote the credit
quality and marketability of green infrastructure bonds or to mitigate the risk
of an increase in interest rates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Authority&quot; means
the New Jersey Economic Development Authority established by section 4 of
P.L.1974, c.80 (C.34:1B-4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Board&quot; means the
Board of Public Utilities or any successor agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Clean energy
technology&quot; means any commercially available technology that enables the
State to meet its renewable energy portfolio standards or any energy efficiency
or conservation program requirements, demand response technology or energy use
reduction or demand-side management infrastructure, programs, and services and
approved by a board rule or order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Financing costs&quot;
means any of the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The principal and
interest payable on green infrastructure bonds;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Any payment required
pursuant to an ancillary agreement entered into in connection with the issuance
of green infrastructure bonds;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Any amount required to
fund or replenish a reserve account or another account established under any
indenture, ancillary agreement, or other financing document in connection with
the issuance of green infrastructure bonds;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Any redemption or call
premium or cost of redeeming or refunding any existing debt of the authority in

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a
regulatory financing structure that authorizes New Jersey Economic Development
Authority (authority), in conjunction with the Board of Public Utilities
(board), to acquire and provide low-cost financing, to be deployed through a
financing program to make green infrastructure equipment and installations
accessible and affordable for New Jerseys electric and gas public utility
(utility) customers desiring financing for this purpose, achieve measurable
cost savings, and attain the State's clean energy goals.  Green infrastructure
equipment is infrastructure improvements, equipment, and personal property to
be installed to deploy clean energy technology, demand response technology, and
energy use reduction and demand side management infrastructure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill: 1)
establishes a green infrastructure loan program (loan program) for the purpose
of acquiring and providing alternative low-cost financing for green
infrastructure equipment and installations accessible and affordable for
utility customers, through a financing program administered by the authority,
and may include loans made to private entities who may lease or provide green
infrastructure equipment to utility customers, as well as direct loans to
utility customers, on terms approved by the authority; 2) authorizes the
creation of green infrastructure property consisting of all property, rights,
and interests of the loan program, which shall vest in the authority for the
purpose of securing bond amounts payable under the loan program, and other
financing costs; 3) establishes a green infrastructure fee, a non-bypassable
bill fee imposed on and collected from those utility customers receiving a loan
made to finance the purchase or installation of green infrastructure equipment
on the property enhanced by the equipment under the loan program and, if there
is an outstanding obligation on the loan, that obligation is to be transferred
to the new property owner; 4) authorizes the authority to issue revenue bonds
to finance the loan program; 5) establishes a green infrastructure fund to be
administered by the authority and to receive the proceeds of the green
infrastructure fee, green infrastructure property, the loan program and other
monies expended on the operations of the loan program, including through
credits to utility customers subject to the green infrastructure fee for
reimbursement of excess green infrastructure fees collected; and 6) authorizes
the authority to issue up to $200,000,000 in revenue bonds to establish and
administer the loan program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Up-front costs of green
infrastructure equipment are a barrier preventing many utility customers from
investing in these installations and thereby achieving lower energy costs. 
Existing programs may not serve the entire spectrum of New Jerseys energy
market, particularly those utility customers who lack access to capital or who
cannot afford these up-front costs, thereby creating an underserved market.  This
measure will establish a means of acquiring and providing alternative low-cost
financing to underserved markets, enabling the installation of green infrastructure
equipment in those markets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Significant investment in
green infrastructure equipment will help the State achieve its goals of energy
self-sufficiency and greater energy security and diversification, support its
efforts to meet the States renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency
requirements as its energy market is evolving, and provide affordable and
accessible energy options for New Jersey utility customers.</p>
