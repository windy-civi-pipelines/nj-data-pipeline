A Joint Resolution designating July 8 of each year as New Jersey Revolutionary War Remembrance Day. Whereas, The American Revolution remains a triumph for the cause of liberty, self-government, and the rule of law both here and around the globe; and Whereas, Victory in this conflict would not have been possible if not for the brave men and women who laid down their lives in order to protect their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and Whereas, Nearly 13,000 Americans were killed or injured as a result of the war; and Whereas, New Jersey played an important role in the American Revolution given its location between the British stronghold of New York and the patriot capital of Philadelphia; and Whereas, Communities across the State sent many of their young men to fight in the Continental Army, found themselves divided between the patriot and loyalist causes, and were witness to the wars devastation; and Whereas, From the conclusion of the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775 until the British formally surrendered at Yorktown in 1783, nearly 300 significant military engagements occurred within the State earning it the nickname Crossroads of the American Revolution; and Whereas, Of particular significance were the Ten Crucial Days Campaign and the Battle of Monmouth which turned the tide in favor of the colonists; and Whereas, The Ten Crucial Days Campaign took place from December 25, 1776 to January 3, 1777 and describes the 10-day period where the Continental Army, after suffering a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Long Island, secured key victories at the Battles of Trenton, Assunpink Creek, and Princeton; and Whereas, The Battle of Monmouth took place on June 28, 1778 near present-day Freehold and while the battle did not produce a clear winner, the Continental Army emerged with a newfound sense of confidence in both their fighting abilities and Washingtons leadership at a time when ultimate victory was uncertain; and Whereas, It is these two engagements which served as inspiration for the iconic images of Washington crossing the Delaware River and Molly Pitcher loading a cannon at the Battle of Monmouth; and Whereas, New Jersey was also the site of the Continental Armys infamous encampment at Jockey Hollow where soldiers battled extreme winter weather and supply shortages; and Whereas, By the time the conflict officially ended, Washington spent more time in New Jersey than any other state; and Whereas, Today, New Jersey has over 250 Revolutionary War sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places providing Americans with the opportunity to learn more about their national heritage; and Whereas, The story of American independence cannot be told without New Jersey; and Whereas, This State should continue to highlight the important role it played in the American Revolution and remember those in New Jersey who lost their lives fighting for our nations independence; and Whereas, July 8 is an appropriate day to honor New Jerseys Revolutionary War heritage for it was on July 8, 1776 that the Declaration of Independence received its first public reading in New Jersey; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    July 8 of each year is designated as New Jersey Revolutionary War Remembrance Day to acknowledge the important role New Jersey played in the American Revolution and to remember those in New Jersey who lost their lives fighting for our nations independence. 2.    The Governor is respectfully requested to issue an annual proclamation calling upon public officials and citizens of this State to observe New Jersey Revolutionary War Remembrance Day with appropriate activities and programs. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution designates July 8 of each year as New Jersey Revolutionary War Remembrance Day for it was on July 8, 1776, the Declaration of Independence, after having been officially adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, received its first public reading in New Jersey. In many respects, the story of American Independence cannot be told without New Jersey. Today, New Jersey has over 250 Revolutionary War sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was witness to nearly 300 significant military engagements from 1775 to 1783.  It was here that Washington, on two separate occasions, turned the tide of the war by crossing the Delaware River to launch a surprise attack on Hessian soldiers at Trenton in December 1776 and rallying his troops at the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778. It is also the place where the Continental Army infamously endured its harshest winter while encamped at Jockey Hollow in the winter of 1779-1780. To bring greater attention to the important role this State played in the American Revolution and to remember those in New Jersey who lost their lives fighting for our nations independence, the sponsor believes it is appropriate to designate July 8 as New Jersey Revolutionary War Remembrance Day.
