STATEMENT This bill expands upon a reciprocity arrangement among county and municipal law enforcement agencies, institutions of higher education, which include county colleges, State law enforcement agencies, and the New Jersey Transit Corporation for the reimbursement of the hiring and training costs incurred when one entity hires a law enforcement officer who resigned from one of the other entities within the first three years of a permanent appointment, and the officer is hired within 120 days of the date of resignation. Under current law, in those cases where the officer has held a probationary appointment at the time of resignation or held a permanent appointment for 30 days or less, the new employer must reimburse the officers former employer for all the costs associated with the officers hiring and training.  In those cases where the officer has held a permanent appointment for more than 30 days, but less than two years, the new employer must reimburse the officers former employer for one-half of the costs associated with the officers hiring and training. The purpose of this bill is to extend the reciprocity arrangement to require a hiring entity to reimburse the officers former employer for 100 percent of the cost of the officers hiring and training if the officer resigns within three years of being hired to a permanent position.
