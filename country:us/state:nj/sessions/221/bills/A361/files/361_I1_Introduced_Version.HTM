<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 49 of P.L.2000,
c.161 (C.42:1A-49) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     49.  a.  A limited liability
partnership, and a foreign limited liability partnership authorized to transact
business in this State, shall file an annual report in the office of the Division
of Commercial Recording in the Department of the Treasury which contains:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the name of the limited
liability partnership and the state or other jurisdiction under whose laws the
foreign limited liability partnership is formed;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the street address of
the partnership's chief executive office and, if different, the street address
of an office of the partnership in this State, if any; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   if the partnership does
not have an office in this State, the name and street address of the
partnership's current agent for service of process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    An annual report shall
be filed each year following the calendar year in which a partnership files a
statement of qualification or a foreign partnership becomes authorized to
transact business in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The State Treasurer may
revoke the statement of qualification of a partnership that fails to file an
annual report when due or pay the required filing fee.  To do so, the State
Treasurer shall provide the partnership at least 60 days' written notice of intent
to revoke the statement.  The notice shall be mailed to the partnership at its
chief executive office set forth in the last filed statement of qualification
or annual report.  The notice shall specify the annual report that has not been
filed, the fee that has not been paid, and the effective date of the
revocation.  The revocation is not effective if the annual report is filed and
the fee is paid before the effective date of the revocation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A revocation under
subsection c. of this section only affects a partnership's status as a limited
liability partnership and is not an event of dissolution of the partnership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     A partnership whose
statement of qualification has been revoked may apply to the Division of
Commercial Recording in the Department of the Treasury for reinstatement within
two years after the effective date of the revocation.  The application shall
state:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the name of the
partnership and the effective date of the revocation; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   that the ground for
revocation either did not exist or has been corrected; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   payment by the
partnership of all fees due to the State Treasurer including a reinstatement
filing fee of $75.00, current annual report fee, and all delinquent annual
report fees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A reinstatement under
subsection e. of this section relates back to and takes effect as of the
effective date of the revocation, and the partnership's status as a limited
liability partnership continues as if the revocation had never occurred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>g.    The State Treasurer
shall ensure that a limited liability partnership, and a foreign limited
liability partnership authorized to transact business in this State, shall have
the option to file the annual report electronically, and shall have the option
to file the annual report in conjunction with a business registration or a
renewal of a business registration as defined pursuant to section 1 of
P.L.2001, c.134 (C.52:32-44).  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 69 of P.L.1983,
c.489 (C.42:2A-69) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     69.  a.  Every domestic
limited partnership authorized in this State shall file in the Department of
the Treasury, within the time prescribed by this section, an annual report,
executed on behalf of the limited partnership or executed by the registered
agent setting forth:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The name of the limited
partnership;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The address, including
the actual location as well as the postal designation, if different, of the
registered agent in this State; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    The name of the
registered agent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The State Treasurer
shall designate a date of filing annual reports for each limited partnership
required to submit a report pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If the report is not
filed for two consecutive years, the certificate of limited partnership shall,
after written demand for the reports by the State Treasurer by mail addressed
to the limited partnership at the last address appearing of record in the
office of the State Treasurer, remain filed but be transferred to an inactive
list.  A limited partnership shall not have its certificate of limited
partnership transferred to the inactive list if it shall, within 60 days after
the written demand, file the reports required by law and pay to the State
Treasurer the fee provided by law for the filing of each report.</p>
