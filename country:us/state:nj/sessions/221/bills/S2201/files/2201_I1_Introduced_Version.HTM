becomes reemployed, the two months of 100 percent income disregard and the six
months of 75 percent income may be reapplied no more than once every 12-months;
otherwise, the 50 percent income disregard will apply.  </span></p>

additional supportive services to program recipients.  Current law provides
that assistance may be provided as a last resort when no other source of

the commissioner.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;

quality child care services for their dependent children.</span></p>

individuals date of entry into the United States, country of origin, length of
time in the United States, whether the individual is a veteran, whether the
individual is a victim of domestic violence, and whether the individual has
satisfied certain work requirements, among other factors.  The bill replaces
the term aliens with eligible immigrants, and provides that the term
applies to all immigrants who otherwise meet program requirements and are lawfully
present in the United States.  The term will include individuals who are
qualified aliens or lawfully present for the purposes of federal law,
individuals granted relief from federal immigration laws under the federal

an applicant will not be deemed ineligible for benefits on the grounds that the
applicant's eligibility is the result of a cessation of employment, unless the
applicant intentionally and voluntarily leaves employment, without good cause,
within 30 days prior to the date of application for benefits, for the sole
purpose of qualifying for WFNJ benefits.  Under current law, an applicant is

application for benefits is not to exceed the value of the income or resource
divided by the monthly standard of need, or 12 months, whichever value is
less.  Income and resources received by a recipient may not be used to
prospectively disqualify a recipient from assistance and are to be considered
only in the month received and at the time of any new application, except in
the case of a voluntary assignment or transfer of income or resources.   The
bill also clarifies that the agreement a recipient must sign stating that
repayment of benefits will be made, in the event of receipt of income or
resources, includes the receipt of General Assistance repayment subject to a
Supplemental Security Income Interim Assistance Reimbursement Agreement, but
excludes repayment from unemployment benefits and other government benefits.</span></p>

purposes and goals of the WFNJ program to provide that the purpose of the
program is to provide recipients with the opportunities, training, and work
skills needed to help elevate them out of poverty.  The bill removes certain
language concerning how the program interacts with young parents and how the
system can be disruptive to the family structure, as well as language stating
that the program is consistent with federal law by including a time limit on
benefits, work requirements, enhanced measures to determine paternity, enhanced
child support collection, sanctions for noncompliance with program
requirements, incentives for teenage parents to complete school, and
restrictions on eligibility for aliens.  The bill additionally removes language

sustainable avoidance of, poverty.  Recipients will be permitted to forgo work
opportunities for good cause or for other opportunities that will better enable
the recipient to emerge from, and sustainably avoid, poverty.  The bill
requires that good cause be considered broadly in consideration of the
recipients health, safety, family needs, financial considerations, and other

recipients continuously and actively seek employment.</span></p>

activity from 40 hours per week to 30 hours per week, and provides that the
maximum aggregate requirement is 20 hours per week for assistance units with a
child under six years of age.  Current law provides for a deferral from the
work activity requirement for parents and relatives caring for a child under 12
weeks of age; the bill extends this deferral to apply to parents and relatives
caring for a child under one year of age.</span></p>

other adult or child members of the assistance unit who are compliant with
program requirements, which members will continue to be eligible for their full
pro-rata share of cash assistance benefits.  If the cases of all the adult
members of the assistance unit are closed for noncompliance, the dependent

by the bill, this provision applies until age 19.  Further, the bill provides
