A taxpayer's net gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a share of an S corporation shall be calculated by increasing the adjusted basis of the share by an amount equal to the shareholder's net losses and deductions in respect of the share allowed and deducted from income for federal income tax purposes, not including any personal net operating loss deductions, to the extent that such net losses were not offset by the taxpayer's pro rata share of S corporation income otherwise subject to taxation pursuant to subsection p. of this section in respect of another S corporation, subject to rules of priority and assignment determined by the director.

For purposes of this clause, the term "control" means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80% of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.

For purposes of the bill, a qualified withdrawal is defined as a withdrawal from a retirement trust, plan, fund, account, or annuity, as applicable under the bill, that is permitted under the federal Internal Revenue Code and for which no penalties or additional taxes for nonqualifying withdrawals are assessed pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, regulations issued thereunder, or other directives or guidance of the federal Internal Revenue Service. By excluding additional categories of retirement savings from gross income, it is the sponsors intent to remove a deterrent to retirement savings and provide greater financial security for New Jersey taxpayers as they prepare for, and enter, their retirement years.

For purposes of this clause, the term "control" means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80% of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation. For purposes of this clause, the term "a party to a reorganization" includes a corporation resulting from a reorganization, and both corporations, in the case of a reorganization resulting from the acquisition by one corporation of stock or properties of another.  In the case of a reorganization qualifying under subclause (i) by reason of subclause (vii) the term "a party to a reorganization" includes the controlling corporation referred to in such subclause (vii). Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, upon every such exchange or conversion, the taxpayer's basis for the stock or securities received shall be the same as the taxpayer's actual or attributed basis for the stock, securities or property surrendered in exchange therefor. d.    Net gains or net income derived from or in the form of rents, royalties, patents, and copyrights. e.     Interest, except interest referred to in clause (1) or (2) of N.J.S.54A:6-14, or distributions paid by a qualified investment fund as defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.310 (C.54A:6-14.1), to the extent provided in that section. f.     Dividends.

STATEMENT This bill excludes contributions, qualified withdrawals, and rollovers from certain retirement savings accounts from a taxpayers gross income.  Specifically, the bill would exclude any amounts that are contributed to, or received as a qualified withdrawal from: (1) a plan established under section 401(a) or section 401(k) of the federal Internal Revenue Code; (2) amounts paid for annuity contracts under section 403(b) of the federal Internal Revenue Code which are offered to government and nonprofit employees; (3) a deferred compensation plan established under section 457 of the federal Internal Revenue Code; (4) a federal Thrift Savings Plan; or (5) an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) established pursuant to section 408 of the federal Internal Revenue Code.  The bill would also exclude from gross income any rollovers from an IRA to another retirement savings account. For purposes of the bill, a qualified withdrawal is defined as a withdrawal from a retirement trust, plan, fund, account, or annuity, as applicable under the bill, that is permitted under the federal Internal Revenue Code and for which no penalties or additional taxes for nonqualifying withdrawals are assessed pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, regulations issued thereunder, or other directives or guidance of the federal Internal Revenue Service. By excluding additional categories of retirement savings from gross income, it is the sponsors intent to remove a deterrent to retirement savings and provide greater financial security for New Jersey taxpayers as they prepare for, and enter, their retirement years.
