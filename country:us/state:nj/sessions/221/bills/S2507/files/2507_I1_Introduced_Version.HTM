property, capital improvement or personal property, or interests therein, not
needed for public use, as set forth in the resolution or ordinance authorizing
the sale, other than county or municipal lands, real property otherwise
dedicated or restricted pursuant to law, and, except as otherwise provided by
law, all such sales shall be made by one of the following methods:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   By open public sale at
auction to the highest bidder after advertisement thereof in a newspaper
circulating in the municipality or municipalities in which the lands are
situated, by two insertions at least once a week during two consecutive weeks,
the last publication to be not earlier than seven days prior to such sale.  In
the case of public sales, the governing body may by resolution fix a minimum
price or prices, with or without the reservation of the right to reject all
bids where the highest bid is not accepted.  Notice of such reservation shall
be included in the advertisement of the sale and public notice thereof shall be
given at the time of sale. Such resolution may provide, without fixing a
minimum price, that upon the completion of the bidding, the highest bid may be
accepted or all the bids may be rejected.  The invitation to bid may also
impose restrictions on the use to be made of such real property, capital
improvement or personal property, and any conditions of sale as to buildings or
structures, or as to the type, size, or other specifications of buildings or
structures to be constructed thereon, or as to demolition, repair, or
reconstruction of buildings or structures, and the time within which such
conditions shall be operative, or any other conditions of sale, in like manner
and to the same extent as by any other vendor.  Such conditions shall be
included in the advertisement, as well as the nature of the interest retained
by the county or municipality.  Such restrictions or conditions shall be
related to a lawful public purpose and encourage and promote fair and competitive
bidding of the county or municipality and shall not, in the case of a
municipality, be inconsistent with or impose a special or higher standard than
any zoning ordinance or building, plumbing, electrical, or similar code or
ordinance then in effect in the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In any case in which a county
or municipality intends to retain an estate or interest in any real property,
capital improvement or personal property, in the nature of an easement,
contingent or reversionary, the invitation to bid and the advertisement
required herein shall require each bidder to submit one bid under each Option A
and Option B below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Option A shall be for
the real property, capital improvement or personal property subject to the
conditions or restrictions imposed, or interest or estate retained, which the
county or municipality proposes to retain or impose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Option B shall be for
the real property, capital improvement or personal property to be sold free of
all such restrictions, conditions, interests or estates on the part of the
county or municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The county or the municipality
may elect or reject either or both options and the highest bid for each.  Such
acceptance or rejection shall be made not later than at the second regular
meeting of the governing body following the sale, and, if the governing body
shall not so accept such highest bid, or reject all bids, said bids shall be
deemed to have been rejected.  Any such sale may be adjourned at the time
advertised for not more than one week without readvertising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   At private sale, when
authorized by resolution, in the case of a county, or by ordinance, in the case
of a municipality, in the following cases:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A sale to any political
subdivision, agency, department, commission, board or body corporate and
politic of the State of New Jersey or to an interstate agency or body of which
the State of New Jersey is a member or to the United States of America or any
department or agency thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A sale to a person
submitting a bid pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, where all bids
have been rejected, provided that the terms and price agreed to shall in no
event be less than the highest bid rejected, and provided further that the
terms and conditions of sale shall remain identical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   A sale by any county or
municipality, when it has or shall have conveyed its right, title and interest
in any real property, capital improvement or personal property not needed for
public use, and it was assumed and intended that there should be conveyed a
good and sufficient title in fee simple to said real property, capital
improvement or personal property, free of all encumbrances and the full
consideration has been paid therefor, and it shall thereafter appear that the
title conveyed was insufficient or that said county or municipality at the time
of said conveyance was not the owner of some estate or interest in said real
property, capital improvement or personal property or of some encumbrances
thereon, and the county or municipality shall thereafter acquire a good and
sufficient title in fee simple, free of all encumbrances of said real property,
capital improvement or personal property or shall acquire such outstanding
estate or interest therein or outstanding encumbrance thereon and said county
or municipality, by resolution of the governing body and without the payment of
any additional consideration, has deemed to convey or otherwise transfer to
said purchaser, his heirs or assigns, such after-acquired title, or estate or
interest in, or encumbrance upon, such real property, capital improvement or
personal property to perfect the title or interest previously conveyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A sale of an easement
upon any real property previously conveyed by any county or municipality may be
made when the governing body of any county, by resolution, or any municipality,
by ordinance, has elected to release the public rights in the nature of
easements, in, on, over or under any real property within the county or the
municipality, as the case may be, upon such terms as shall be agreed upon with
the owner of such lands, if the use of such rights is no longer desirable,
necessary or required for public purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   A sale to the owner of
the real property contiguous to the real property being sold; provided that the
property being sold is less than the minimum size required for development
under the municipal zoning ordinance and is without any capital improvement
thereon; except that when there is more than one owner with real property
contiguous thereto, said property shall be sold to the highest bidder from
among all such owners.  Any such sale shall be for not less than the fair
market value of said real property. When there is only one owner with real
property contiguous to the property being sold, and the property is less than an
eighth of the minimum size required for development under the municipal zoning
ordinance and is without any capital improvement thereon, the fair market value
of that property may be determined by negotiation between the local unit and
the owner of the contiguous real property.  The negotiated sum shall be subject
to approval by resolution of the governing body, but in no case shall that sum
be less than one dollar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of any sale of
real property hereafter made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, in no
event shall the price agreed upon with the owner be less than the difference
between the highest bid accepted for the real property subject to easements
(Option A) and the highest bid rejected for the real property not subject to
easements (Option B).  After the adoption of the resolution or ordinance, and
compliance by the owner of said real property with the terms thereof, said real
property shall be free, and entirely discharged of and from such rights of the
public and of the county or municipality, as the case may be, but no such
release shall affect the right of lawful occupancy or use of any such real
property by any municipal or private utility to occupy or use any such real
property lawfully occupied or used by it.  A list of the property so authorized
to be sold, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, together with the
minimum prices, respectively, as determined by the governing body, shall be
included in the resolution or ordinance authorizing the sale, and said list
shall be posted on the bulletin board or other conspicuous space in the
building which the governing body usually holds its regular meetings, and
advertisement thereof made in a newspaper circulating in the municipality or
municipalities in which the real property, capital improvement or personal
property is situated, within five days following enactment of said resolution
or ordinance.  Offers for any or all properties so listed may thereafter be
made to the governing body or its designee for a period of 20 days following
the advertisement herein required, at not less than said minimum prices, by any
prospective purchaser, real estate broker, or other authorized representative. 
In any such case, the governing body may reconsider its resolution or
ordinance, not later than 30 days after its enactment, and advertise the real
property, capital improvement, or personal property in question for public sale
pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any county or municipality
selling any real property, capital improvement or personal property pursuant to
subsection (b) of this section shall file with the Director of the Division of
Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs, sworn
affidavits verifying the publication of advertisements as required by this
subsection.</p>

resolution of the governing body; provided, however, that such mortgage shall
be fully payable within five years from the date of the sale and shall bear
interest at a rate equal to that authorized under Title 31 of the Revised

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would make procedural
modifications to the process through which municipalities exercise
redevelopment power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     First, the bill would require
that municipalities act by ordinance rather than resolution in acting under the
&quot;Local Redevelopment and Housing Law,&quot; P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et
seq.).  This would require a more elaborate publication and hearing process
than that which is required when a municipality acts by resolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill enhances notification
requirements under this law. Under current law, when a municipal governing body
designates properties within a redevelopment area, it is required to authorize
the planning board to undertake a preliminary investigation to determine
whether the proposed area fulfills those criteria which the law establishes in
order to be so designated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Although the current law does
provide for notification when an area is to be designated, the hearing notice
is only required to set forth the general boundaries of the area to be
investigated and notice that the map shall be made available at the office of
the municipal clerk.  Property owners in the proposed redevelopment area are to
be notified by regular mail, under the current law, with no information to be
provided as to what a redevelopment designation means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require that
the hearing notice clearly delineate the properties which are to be included in
the redevelopment area and that notice to property owners be provided by
certified mail.  In addition, the bill requires that a Public Advisory
Statement be sent to every property owner within the redevelopment area as part
of the required notification and prescribes the content of this statement.  The
purpose of this Public Advisory Statement is to explain to property owners
within the redevelopment area that municipalities are granted broad powers to
facilitate economic development within redevelopment areas, which includes the
power to exercise eminent domain.  Additionally, the notification is designed
to inform property owners of their recourse in this situation and who to
contact for further information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires both the
planning board and municipal governing body to hold public hearings on the
redevelopment plan, which is required to be prepared before a municipality is
authorized to undertake a redevelopment project under existing law.  In
addition, the bill requires that property owners within the designated
redevelopment area be provided with certified mail notice in advance of the
public hearing held by the municipal governing body.  Under current law, the
redevelopment plan is to be adopted by ordinance and the municipality is only
required to provide that notice associated with the adoption of an ordinance
under general law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, when the
governing body originates the redevelopment plan, it is required to transmit a
copy of the proposed redevelopment plan to the planning board for
recommendations and an analysis of the consistency of that plan with the
municipal master plan.  The law gives the planning board 45 days within which
to report back to the governing body.  Given the addition of a mandatory public
hearing process by this bill, this 45 day review period is extended to 90 days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law authorizes
municipalities to lease or convey property or improvements &quot;without public
bidding and at such prices and upon such terms as it deems reasonable.&quot; 
By removing this exception from public bidding and vague language deferring to
the municipality as to the establishment of a price for such property or
improvements, this bill would require open public bidding and, thereby, the
establishment of a market price through a transparent transaction process.</p>
