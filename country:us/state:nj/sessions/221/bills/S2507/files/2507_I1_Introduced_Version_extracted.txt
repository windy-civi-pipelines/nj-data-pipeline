S2507 SENATE, No. 2507 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 5, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  SHIRLEY K. TURNER District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS Enhances transparency in exercise of municipal redevelopment powers. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning certain procedural requirements associated with the exercise of municipal redevelopment powers, amending and supplementing P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.), and amending P.L.1971, c.199. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 6 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-6) is amended to read as follows: 6.    a. No area of a municipality shall be determined a redevelopment area unless the governing body of the municipality shall, by [resolution] ordinance, authorize the planning board to undertake a preliminary investigation to determine whether the proposed area is a redevelopment area according to the criteria set forth in section 5 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-5). Such determination by the planning board shall be made after public notice and public hearing as provided in subsection b. of this section.  The governing body of a municipality shall assign the conduct of the investigation and hearing to the planning board of the municipality.  The [resolution] ordinance authorizing the planning board to undertake a preliminary investigation shall state whether the redevelopment area determination shall authorize the municipality to use all those powers provided by the Legislature for use in a redevelopment area other than the use of eminent domain (hereinafter referred to as a "Non-Condemnation Redevelopment Area") or whether the redevelopment area determination shall authorize the municipality to use all those powers provided by the Legislature for use in a redevelopment area, including the power of eminent domain (hereinafter referred to as a "Condemnation Redevelopment Area"). b.    (1)  Before proceeding to a public hearing on the matter, the planning board shall prepare a map showing the boundaries of the proposed redevelopment area and the location of the various parcels of property included therein.  There shall be appended to the map a statement setting forth the basis for the investigation. (2)   The planning board shall specify a date for and give notice of a hearing for the purpose of hearing persons who are interested in or would be affected by a determination that the delineated area is a redevelopment area. (3)   (a)  The hearing notice shall set forth the general boundaries of the area to be investigated and [state that] a map [has been prepared and can be inspected at the office of the municipal clerk] which clearly delineates the properties which are included in the redevelopment area.  In addition, the hearing notice shall include a Public Advisory Statement which shall be substantially in the form set forth in section 2 of P.L.    c. (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (b) If the governing body [resolution] ordinance assigning the investigation to the planning board, pursuant to subsection a. of this section, stated that the redevelopment determination shall establish a Non-Condemnation Redevelopment Area, the notice of the hearing shall specifically state that a redevelopment area determination shall not authorize the municipality to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire any property in the delineated area. (c) If the [resolution] ordinance assigning the investigation to the planning board, pursuant to subsection a. of this section, stated that the redevelopment determination shall establish a Condemnation Redevelopment Area, the notice of the hearing shall specifically state that a redevelopment area determination shall authorize the municipality to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire property in the delineated area. (d) A copy of the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality once each week for two consecutive weeks, and the last publication shall be not less than ten days prior to the date set for the hearing.  A copy of the notice shall be [mailed] sent by certified mail, at least [ten] 14 days prior to the date set for the hearing to the last owner [, if any,] of each parcel of property within the area according to the assessment records of the municipality.  A notice shall also be sent by certified mail to all persons at their last known address, [if any,] whose names are noted on the assessment records as claimants of an interest in any such parcel.  The assessor of the municipality shall make a notation upon the records when requested to do so by any person claiming to have an interest in any parcel of property in the municipality.  The notice shall be published and mailed by certified mail by the municipal clerk, or by such clerk or official as the planning board shall otherwise designate.  Failure to mail any such notice shall [not] invalidate the investigation or determination thereon. (4) At the hearing, which may be adjourned from time to time, the planning board shall hear all persons who are interested in or would be affected by a determination that the delineated area is a redevelopment area. All objections to such a determination and evidence in support of those objections, given orally or in writing, shall be received and considered and made part of the public record. (5) (a)  After completing its hearing on this matter, the planning board shall recommend that the delineated area, or any part thereof, be determined, or not be determined, by the municipal governing body to be a redevelopment area.  In the event that the planning board does not recommend that the entire delineated area be designated as a redevelopment area, the planning board shall state its reasons, in writing, for not designating any property or properties, as proposed by the governing body. (b)   After receiving the recommendation of the planning board, the municipal governing body may adopt [a resolution] an ordinance determining that the delineated area, or any part thereof, is a redevelopment area. (c)   Upon the adoption of [a resolution] an ordinance, the clerk of the municipality shall, forthwith, transmit a copy of the [resolution] ordinance to the Commissioner of Community Affairs for review, along with the recommendations of the planning board.  If the area in need of redevelopment is not situated in an area in which development or redevelopment is to be encouraged pursuant to any State law or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, the determination shall not take effect without first receiving the review and the approval of the commissioner.  If the commissioner does not issue an approval or disapproval within 30 calendar days of transmittal by the clerk, the determination shall be deemed to be approved.  If the area in need of redevelopment is situated in an area in which development or redevelopment is to be encouraged pursuant to any State law or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, then the determination shall take effect after the clerk has transmitted a copy of the [resolution] ordinance to the commissioner.  The determination, if supported by substantial evidence and, if required, approved by the commissioner, shall be binding and conclusive upon all persons affected by the determination. (d)   Notice of the determination shall be served, within 10 days after the determination, upon all record owners of property located within the delineated area, those whose names are listed on the tax assessor's records, and upon each person who filed a written objection thereto and stated, in or upon the written submission, an address to which notice of determination may be sent. (e)   If the governing body [resolution] ordinance assigning the investigation to the planning board, pursuant to subsection a. of this section, stated that the redevelopment determination shall establish a Condemnation Redevelopment Area, the notice of the determination required pursuant to subparagraph (d) of this paragraph shall indicate that: (i)    the determination operates as a finding of public purpose and authorizes the municipality to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire property in the redevelopment area, and (ii)   legal action to challenge the determination must be commenced within 45 days of receipt of notice and that failure to do so shall preclude an owner from later raising such challenge. (f)   No municipality or redevelopment entity shall exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire property for redevelopment purposes within a Non-Condemnation Redevelopment Area. (g)   If a municipal governing body has determined an area to be a Non-Condemnation Redevelopment Area and is unable to acquire property that is necessary for the redevelopment project, the municipality may initiate and follow the process set forth in this section to determine whether the area or property is a Condemnation Redevelopment Area. Such determination shall be based upon the then-existing conditions and not based upon the condition of the area or property at the time of the prior Non-Condemnation Redevelopment Area determination. (h)   A property owner who has received notice pursuant to this section who does not file a legal challenge to the redevelopment determination affecting his or her property within 45 days of receipt of such notice shall thereafter be barred from filing such a challenge and, in the case of a Condemnation Redevelopment Area and upon compliance with the notice provisions of subparagraph (e) of this paragraph, shall further be barred from asserting a challenge to the redevelopment determination as a defense in any condemnation proceeding to acquire the property unless the municipality and the property owner agree otherwise. (6)   [The municipality shall, for 45 days next following its determination, take no further action to acquire any property by condemnation within the redevelopment area.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (7)   If any person shall, within 45 days after the adoption by the municipality of the determination, apply to the Superior Court, the court may grant further review of the determination by procedure in lieu of prerogative writ; and in any such action the court may make any incidental order that it deems proper. c.     An area determined to be in need of redevelopment pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be a "blighted area" for the purposes of Article VIII, Section III, paragraph 1 of the Constitution.  If an area is determined to be a redevelopment area and a redevelopment plan is adopted for that area in accordance with the provisions of this act, the municipality is authorized to utilize all those powers provided in section 8 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-8), except that a municipality may not acquire any land or building by condemnation pursuant to subsection c. of that section unless the land or building is located within (1) an area that was determined to be in need of redevelopment prior to the effective date of P.L.2013, c.159, or (2) a Condemnation Redevelopment Area for which the municipality has complied with the provisions of subparagraph (e) of paragraph (5) of subsection b. of this section. (cf: P.L.2013, c.159, s.2) 2.    (New section)  Each hearing notice circulated as required pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-6) shall include notice which shall be in substantially the following form: "PUBLIC ADVISORY STATEMENT The governing body of ...................... (insert name of municipality) in which you reside has authorized the planning board to undertake a study to determine whether your neighborhood fulfills the definition of a redevelopment area under New Jersey State law.  Your property has been included by your governing body in the proposed redevelopment area. State law requires those property owners whose properties are included within the redevelopment area to receive notice prior to the holding of a hearing by your municipal planning board.  The first hearing by the planning board will be held at ........ (insert time) on  ........... (insert date) at ................... (insert place). Municipalities are granted broad powers to facilitate economic development in a redevelopment area, including the acquisition of properties using eminent domain.  In other words, by being located in the redevelopment area, your property could be subject to condemnation. All interested persons are entitled to testify before the planning board under State law, either verbally or through written objection. All objections shall be made part of the public record.  Any determination by the governing body that an area is a redevelopment area is considered binding on all property owners included within the redevelopment area.  Any person who files a written objection to this determination is entitled to a copy of the determination within 10 days of municipal action. A property owner who filed a written objection to municipal declaration of a redevelopment area and who remains opposed to the declaration has 45 days following the declaration by the municipality to apply to the Superior Court for review of the municipal action. Any person seeking further clarification of your rights under the redevelopment law may contact the municipal clerk at ................. (insert telephone number) or the Commissioner of Community Affairs in Trenton at (609) 292-6420." 3.    Section 7 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-7) is amended to read as follows: 7.    a.  No redevelopment project shall be undertaken or carried out except in accordance with a redevelopment plan adopted by [ordinance of] the municipal governing body, [upon its finding] as provided in this section and section 4 of P.L.    , c.     (C.           ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The redevelopment plan shall be adopted by ordinance only after the municipal governing body has conducted at least one public hearing thereon following the receipt of the report of the planning board as required pursuant to section 4 of P.L.    , c. (C.           ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  In addition, the municipal governing body shall include within the ordinance detailed findings that the specifically delineated project area is located in an area in need of redevelopment or in an area in need of rehabilitation, or in both, according to criteria set forth in section 5 or section 14 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-5 or 40A:12A-14), as appropriate and that the plan fulfills all of the criteria set forth in this section. The redevelopment plan shall include an outline for the planning, development, redevelopment, or rehabilitation of the project area sufficient to indicate: (1)   Its relationship to definite local objectives as to appropriate land uses, density of population, and improved traffic and public transportation, public utilities, recreational and community facilities and other public improvements. (2)   Proposed land uses and building requirements in the project area. (3)   Adequate provision for the temporary and permanent relocation, as necessary, of residents in the project area, including an estimate of the extent to which decent, safe and sanitary dwelling units affordable to displaced residents will be available to them in the existing local housing market. (4)   An identification of any property within the redevelopment area which is proposed to be acquired in accordance with the redevelopment plan. (5)   Any significant relationship of the redevelopment plan to (a) the master plans of contiguous municipalities, (b) the master plan of the county in which the municipality is located, and (c) the State Development and Redevelopment Plan adopted pursuant to the "State Planning Act," P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.). (6)   As of the date of the adoption of the resolution finding the area to be in need of redevelopment, an inventory of all housing units affordable to low and moderate income households, as defined pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304), that are to be removed as a result of implementation of the redevelopment plan, whether as a result of subsidies or market conditions, listed by affordability level, number of bedrooms, and tenure. (7)   A plan for the provision, through new construction or substantial rehabilitation of one comparable, affordable replacement housing unit for each affordable housing unit that has been occupied at any time within the last 18 months, that is subject to affordability controls and that is identified as to be removed as a result of implementation of the redevelopment plan.  Displaced residents of housing units provided under any State or federal housing subsidy program, or pursuant to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), provided they are deemed to be eligible, shall have first priority for those replacement units provided under the plan; provided that any such replacement unit shall not be credited against a prospective municipal obligation under the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), if the housing unit which is removed had previously been credited toward satisfying the municipal fair share obligation.  To the extent reasonably feasible, replacement housing shall be provided within or in close proximity to the redevelopment area.  A municipality shall report annually to the Department of Community Affairs on its progress in implementing the plan for provision of comparable, affordable replacement housing required pursuant to this section. (8)   Proposed locations for public electric vehicle charging infrastructure within the project area in a manner that appropriately connects with an essential public charging network. b.    A redevelopment plan may include the provision of affordable housing in accordance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the housing element of the municipal master plan. c.     The redevelopment plan shall describe its relationship to pertinent municipal development regulations as defined in the "Municipal Land Use Law," P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.).  The redevelopment plan shall supersede applicable provisions of the development regulations of the municipality or constitute an overlay zoning district within the redevelopment area.  When the redevelopment plan supersedes any provision of the development regulations, the ordinance adopting the redevelopment plan shall contain an explicit amendment to the zoning district map included in the zoning ordinance.  The zoning district map as amended shall indicate the redevelopment area to which the redevelopment plan applies.  [Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Municipal Land Use Law," P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) or of other law, no notice beyond that required for adoption of ordinances by the municipality shall be required for the hearing on or adoption of the redevelopment plan or subsequent amendments thereof.] d.    All provisions of the redevelopment plan shall be either substantially consistent with the municipal master plan or designed to effectuate the master plan; but the municipal governing body may adopt a redevelopment plan which is inconsistent with or not designed to effectuate the master plan by affirmative vote of a majority of its full authorized membership with the reasons for so acting set forth in the redevelopment plan. e.     Prior to the adoption of a redevelopment plan, or revision or amendment thereto, the governing body shall refer the plan, revision, or amendment, as appropriate, to the planning board [shall transmit to the governing body, within 45 days after referral, a report containing its recommendation concerning the redevelopment plan], which shall report back to the governing body within 90 days of referral, following a public hearing held by the planning board according to the procedure followed by the municipality in adopting the master plan, as required pursuant to subsection a. of section 19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28).  [This] The planning board report shall include an identification of any provisions in the proposed redevelopment plan which are inconsistent with the master plan and recommendations concerning these inconsistencies and any other matters as the board deems appropriate.  The governing body, when considering the adoption of a redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof, shall review the report of the planning board and may approve or disapprove or change any recommendation by a vote of a majority of its full authorized membership and shall record in its minutes the reasons for not following the recommendations. Failure of the planning board to transmit its report within the required [45] 90 days shall relieve the governing body from the requirements of this subsection with regard to the pertinent proposed redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof.  Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the applicability of the provisions of subsection d. of this section with respect to any redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof. f.     The governing body of a municipality may direct the planning board to prepare a redevelopment plan or an amendment or revision to a redevelopment plan for a designated redevelopment area.  After completing the redevelopment plan, the planning board shall transmit the proposed plan to the governing body for its adoption.  The governing body, when considering the proposed plan, may amend or revise any portion of the proposed redevelopment plan by an affirmative vote of the majority of its full authorized membership and shall record in its minutes the reasons for each amendment or revision.  When a redevelopment plan or amendment to a redevelopment plan is referred to the governing body by the planning board under this subsection, the governing body shall be relieved of the referral requirements of subsection e. of this section. Regardless of whether the redevelopment plan is prepared by the governing body or the planning board as provided in this subsection, the governing body shall not consider the proposed redevelopment plan or any amendment or revision thereto for a vote until it has complied with the notification and public hearing requirements set forth in section 4 of P.L.     , c.       (C.             ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2021, c.168, s.2) 4.    (New section)  a.  Prior to adopting the redevelopment plan, the governing body shall hold at least one public hearing on the redevelopment plan.  If the boundaries of the redevelopment area have been amended since the designation by the governing body of that area pursuant to paragraph (5) of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-6), the governing body shall prepare and include within the notice to be provided a revised map showing the boundaries of the redevelopment area and the location of the various parcels of property included therein. b.    Not less than 10 days prior to the public hearing, the governing body shall provide notice, specifying a date for and giving notice of a hearing for the purpose of hearing persons who are interested in or would be affected by the implementation of the redevelopment plan.  The hearing notice shall set forth the boundaries of the redevelopment area, including a map of the redevelopment area if the boundaries have changed, as required in subsection a. of this section, and state how interested members of the public can gain access to the proposed redevelopment plan, including the specific hours and location at which the plan may be inspected. c.     A copy of the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality once each week for two consecutive weeks, and the last publication shall be not less than 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing.  A copy of the notice shall be sent by certified mail, at least 14 days prior to the date set for the hearing to the last owner of each parcel of property within the area according to the assessment records of the municipality.  In the event that the boundaries of the redevelopment area have changed since the previous notice, notice also shall be provided to those owners previously situated within the redevelopment area.  A notice shall also be sent by certified mail to all persons at their last known address, whose names are noted on the assessment records as claimants of an interest in any such parcel.  The assessor of the municipality shall make a notation upon the records when requested to do so by any person claiming to have an interest in any parcel of property in the municipality.  The notice shall be published and mailed by the municipal clerk by certified mail, or by such clerk or official as the governing body shall otherwise designate. d.    At the hearing, which may be adjourned from time to time, the governing body shall hear all persons who are interested in or would be affected by the implementation of the redevelopment plan.  All objections to the plan and evidence in support of those objections, given orally or in writing, shall be received and considered and made part of the public record. 5.    Section 8 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-8) is amended to read as follows: 8.    Upon the adoption of a redevelopment plan pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-7), the municipality or redevelopment entity designated by the governing body may proceed with the clearance, replanning, development and redevelopment of the area designated in that plan.  In order to carry out and effectuate the purposes of this act and the terms of the redevelopment plan, the municipality or designated redevelopment entity may: a.     Undertake redevelopment projects, and for this purpose issue bonds in accordance with the provisions of section 29 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-29). b.    Acquire property pursuant to subsection i. of section 22 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-22). c.     Acquire, by condemnation, any land or building which is necessary for the redevelopment project, pursuant to the provisions of the "Eminent Domain Act of 1971," P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-1 et seq.), provided that the land or building is located within (1) an area that was determined to be in need of redevelopment prior to the effective date of P.L.2013, c.159, or (2) a Condemnation Redevelopment Area. d.    Clear any area owned or acquired and install, construct or reconstruct streets, facilities, utilities, and site improvements essential to the preparation of sites for use in accordance with the redevelopment plan. e.     Prepare or arrange by contract for the provision of professional services and the preparation of plans by registered architects, licensed professional engineers or planners, or other consultants for the carrying out of redevelopment projects. f.     Arrange or contract with public agencies or redevelopers for the planning, replanning, construction, or undertaking of any project or redevelopment work, or any part thereof;

Such resolution may provide, without fixing a minimum price, that upon the completion of the bidding, the highest bid may be accepted or all the bids may be rejected.  The invitation to bid may also impose restrictions on the use to be made of such real property, capital improvement or personal property, and any conditions of sale as to buildings or structures, or as to the type, size, or other specifications of buildings or structures to be constructed thereon, or as to demolition, repair, or reconstruction of buildings or structures, and the time within which such conditions shall be operative, or any other conditions of sale, in like manner and to the same extent as by any other vendor.  Such conditions shall be included in the advertisement, as well as the nature of the interest retained by the county or municipality.  Such restrictions or conditions shall be related to a lawful public purpose and encourage and promote fair and competitive bidding of the county or municipality and shall not, in the case of a municipality, be inconsistent with or impose a special or higher standard than any zoning ordinance or building, plumbing, electrical, or similar code or ordinance then in effect in the municipality. In any case in which a county or municipality intends to retain an estate or interest in any real property, capital improvement or personal property, in the nature of an easement, contingent or reversionary, the invitation to bid and the advertisement required herein shall require each bidder to submit one bid under each Option A and Option B below. (1)   Option A shall be for the real property, capital improvement or personal property subject to the conditions or restrictions imposed, or interest or estate retained, which the county or municipality proposes to retain or impose. (2)   Option B shall be for the real property, capital improvement or personal property to be sold free of all such restrictions, conditions, interests or estates on the part of the county or municipality. The county or the municipality may elect or reject either or both options and the highest bid for each.  Such acceptance or rejection shall be made not later than at the second regular meeting of the governing body following the sale, and, if the governing body shall not so accept such highest bid, or reject all bids, said bids shall be deemed to have been rejected.  Any such sale may be adjourned at the time advertised for not more than one week without readvertising. (b)   At private sale, when authorized by resolution, in the case of a county, or by ordinance, in the case of a municipality, in the following cases: (1)   A sale to any political subdivision, agency, department, commission, board or body corporate and politic of the State of New Jersey or to an interstate agency or body of which the State of New Jersey is a member or to the United States of America or any department or agency thereof. (2)   A sale to a person submitting a bid pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, where all bids have been rejected, provided that the terms and price agreed to shall in no event be less than the highest bid rejected, and provided further that the terms and conditions of sale shall remain identical. (3)   A sale by any county or municipality, when it has or shall have conveyed its right, title and interest in any real property, capital improvement or personal property not needed for public use, and it was assumed and intended that there should be conveyed a good and sufficient title in fee simple to said real property, capital improvement or personal property, free of all encumbrances and the full consideration has been paid therefor, and it shall thereafter appear that the title conveyed was insufficient or that said county or municipality at the time of said conveyance was not the owner of some estate or interest in said real property, capital improvement or personal property or of some encumbrances thereon, and the county or municipality shall thereafter acquire a good and sufficient title in fee simple, free of all encumbrances of said real property, capital improvement or personal property or shall acquire such outstanding estate or interest therein or outstanding encumbrance thereon and said county or municipality, by resolution of the governing body and without the payment of any additional consideration, has deemed to convey or otherwise transfer to said purchaser, his heirs or assigns, such after-acquired title, or estate or interest in, or encumbrance upon, such real property, capital improvement or personal property to perfect the title or interest previously conveyed. (4)   A sale of an easement upon any real property previously conveyed by any county or municipality may be made when the governing body of any county, by resolution, or any municipality, by ordinance, has elected to release the public rights in the nature of easements, in, on, over or under any real property within the county or the municipality, as the case may be, upon such terms as shall be agreed upon with the owner of such lands, if the use of such rights is no longer desirable, necessary or required for public purposes. (5)   A sale to the owner of the real property contiguous to the real property being sold; provided that the property being sold is less than the minimum size required for development under the municipal zoning ordinance and is without any capital improvement thereon; except that when there is more than one owner with real property contiguous thereto, said property shall be sold to the highest bidder from among all such owners.  Any such sale shall be for not less than the fair market value of said real property. When there is only one owner with real property contiguous to the property being sold, and the property is less than an eighth of the minimum size required for development under the municipal zoning ordinance and is without any capital improvement thereon, the fair market value of that property may be determined by negotiation between the local unit and the owner of the contiguous real property.  The negotiated sum shall be subject to approval by resolution of the governing body, but in no case shall that sum be less than one dollar. In the case of any sale of real property hereafter made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, in no event shall the price agreed upon with the owner be less than the difference between the highest bid accepted for the real property subject to easements (Option A) and the highest bid rejected for the real property not subject to easements (Option B).  After the adoption of the resolution or ordinance, and compliance by the owner of said real property with the terms thereof, said real property shall be free, and entirely discharged of and from such rights of the public and of the county or municipality, as the case may be, but no such release shall affect the right of lawful occupancy or use of any such real property by any municipal or private utility to occupy or use any such real property lawfully occupied or used by it.  A list of the property so authorized to be sold, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, together with the minimum prices, respectively, as determined by the governing body, shall be included in the resolution or ordinance authorizing the sale, and said list shall be posted on the bulletin board or other conspicuous space in the building which the governing body usually holds its regular meetings, and advertisement thereof made in a newspaper circulating in the municipality or municipalities in which the real property, capital improvement or personal property is situated, within five days following enactment of said resolution or ordinance.  Offers for any or all properties so listed may thereafter be made to the governing body or its designee for a period of 20 days following the advertisement herein required, at not less than said minimum prices, by any prospective purchaser, real estate broker, or other authorized representative. In any such case, the governing body may reconsider its resolution or ordinance, not later than 30 days after its enactment, and advertise the real property, capital improvement, or personal property in question for public sale pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Any county or municipality selling any real property, capital improvement or personal property pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall file with the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs, sworn affidavits verifying the publication of advertisements as required by this subsection. (c)   [By private sale of a municipality in the following case:  A sale to a private developer by a municipality, when acting in accordance with the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.).] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (d)   A county or municipality is also authorized to use electronic procurement practices in accordance with the provisions of P.L.2018, c.156 (C.40A:11-4.7 et al.) for the sale or lease of real property pursuant to the "Local Lands and Buildings Law," P.L.1971, c.199 (C.40A:12-1 et seq.). All sales, either public or private, may be made for cash or upon credit.  A deposit not exceeding [10%] 10 percent of the minimum price or value of the property to be sold may be required of all bidders.  When made upon credit, the county or municipality may accept a purchase-money mortgage, upon terms and conditions which shall be fixed by the resolution of the governing body; provided, however, that such mortgage shall be fully payable within five years from the date of the sale and shall bear interest at a rate equal to that authorized under Title 31 of the Revised Statutes, as amended and supplemented, and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, or the rate last paid by the county or municipality upon any issue of notes pursuant to the "Local Bond Law" (N.J.S.40A:2-1 et seq.), whichever is higher.  The governing body may, by resolution, fix the time for closing of title and payment of the consideration. In all sales made pursuant to this section, the governing body of any county or municipality may provide for the payment of a commission to any real estate broker, or authorized representative other than the purchaser actually consummating such sale; provided, however, that no commission shall be paid unless notice of the governing body's intention to pay such a commission shall have been included in the advertisement of sale and the recipient thereof shall have filed an affidavit with the governing body stating that said recipient is not the purchaser.  Said commissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, [5%] 5 percent of the sale price, and be paid, where there has been a public sale, only in the event that the sum of the commission and the highest bid price does not exceed the next highest bid price (exclusive of any real estate broker's commission). As used in this section, "purchaser" shall mean and include any person, corporation, company, association, society, firm, partnership, or other business entity owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, more than [10%] 10 percent of the purchasing entity. (cf: P.L.2018, c.156, s.7) 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would make procedural modifications to the process through which municipalities exercise redevelopment power. First, the bill would require that municipalities act by ordinance rather than resolution in acting under the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.).  This would require a more elaborate publication and hearing process than that which is required when a municipality acts by resolution. The bill enhances notification requirements under this law. Under current law, when a municipal governing body designates properties within a redevelopment area, it is required to authorize the planning board to undertake a preliminary investigation to determine whether the proposed area fulfills those criteria which the law establishes in order to be so designated. Although the current law does provide for notification when an area is to be designated, the hearing notice is only required to set forth the general boundaries of the area to be investigated and notice that the map shall be made available at the office of the municipal clerk.  Property owners in the proposed redevelopment area are to be notified by regular mail, under the current law, with no information to be provided as to what a redevelopment designation means. This bill would require that the hearing notice clearly delineate the properties which are to be included in the redevelopment area and that notice to property owners be provided by certified mail.  In addition, the bill requires that a Public Advisory Statement be sent to every property owner within the redevelopment area as part of the required notification and prescribes the content of this statement.  The purpose of this Public Advisory Statement is to explain to property owners within the redevelopment area that municipalities are granted broad powers to facilitate economic development within redevelopment areas, which includes the power to exercise eminent domain.  Additionally, the notification is designed to inform property owners of their recourse in this situation and who to contact for further information. The bill requires both the planning board and municipal governing body to hold public hearings on the redevelopment plan, which is required to be prepared before a municipality is authorized to undertake a redevelopment project under existing law.  In addition, the bill requires that property owners within the designated redevelopment area be provided with certified mail notice in advance of the public hearing held by the municipal governing body.  Under current law, the redevelopment plan is to be adopted by ordinance and the municipality is only required to provide that notice associated with the adoption of an ordinance under general law. Under current law, when the governing body originates the redevelopment plan, it is required to transmit a copy of the proposed redevelopment plan to the planning board for recommendations and an analysis of the consistency of that plan with the municipal master plan.  The law gives the planning board 45 days within which to report back to the governing body.  Given the addition of a mandatory public hearing process by this bill, this 45 day review period is extended to 90 days. Current law authorizes municipalities to lease or convey property or improvements "without public bidding and at such prices and upon such terms as it deems reasonable." By removing this exception from public bidding and vague language deferring to the municipality as to the establishment of a price for such property or improvements, this bill would require open public bidding and, thereby, the establishment of a market price through a transparent transaction process.

S2507 SENATE, No. 2507 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 5, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  SHIRLEY K. TURNER District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS Enhances transparency in exercise of municipal redevelopment powers. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning certain procedural requirements associated with the exercise of municipal redevelopment powers, amending and supplementing P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.), and amending P.L.1971, c.199. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 6 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-6) is amended to read as follows: 6.    a. No area of a municipality shall be determined a redevelopment area unless the governing body of the municipality shall, by [resolution] ordinance, authorize the planning board to undertake a preliminary investigation to determine whether the proposed area is a redevelopment area according to the criteria set forth in section 5 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-5). Such determination by the planning board shall be made after public notice and public hearing as provided in subsection b. of this section.  The governing body of a municipality shall assign the conduct of the investigation and hearing to the planning board of the municipality.  The [resolution] ordinance authorizing the planning board to undertake a preliminary investigation shall state whether the redevelopment area determination shall authorize the municipality to use all those powers provided by the Legislature for use in a redevelopment area other than the use of eminent domain (hereinafter referred to as a "Non-Condemnation Redevelopment Area") or whether the redevelopment area determination shall authorize the municipality to use all those powers provided by the Legislature for use in a redevelopment area, including the power of eminent domain (hereinafter referred to as a "Condemnation Redevelopment Area"). b.    (1)  Before proceeding to a public hearing on the matter, the planning board shall prepare a map showing the boundaries of the proposed redevelopment area and the location of the various parcels of property included therein.  There shall be appended to the map a statement setting forth the basis for the investigation. (2)   The planning board shall specify a date for and give notice of a hearing for the purpose of hearing persons who are interested in or would be affected by a determination that the delineated area is a redevelopment area. (3)   (a)  The hearing notice shall set forth the general boundaries of the area to be investigated and [state that] a map [has been prepared and can be inspected at the office of the municipal clerk] which clearly delineates the properties which are included in the redevelopment area.  In addition, the hearing notice shall include a Public Advisory Statement which shall be substantially in the form set forth in section 2 of P.L.    c. (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (b) If the governing body [resolution] ordinance assigning the investigation to the planning board, pursuant to subsection a. of this section, stated that the redevelopment determination shall establish a Non-Condemnation Redevelopment Area, the notice of the hearing shall specifically state that a redevelopment area determination shall not authorize the municipality to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire any property in the delineated area. (c) If the [resolution] ordinance assigning the investigation to the planning board, pursuant to subsection a. of this section, stated that the redevelopment determination shall establish a Condemnation Redevelopment Area, the notice of the hearing shall specifically state that a redevelopment area determination shall authorize the municipality to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire property in the delineated area. (d) A copy of the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality once each week for two consecutive weeks, and the last publication shall be not less than ten days prior to the date set for the hearing.  A copy of the notice shall be [mailed] sent by certified mail, at least [ten] 14 days prior to the date set for the hearing to the last owner [, if any,] of each parcel of property within the area according to the assessment records of the municipality.  A notice shall also be sent by certified mail to all persons at their last known address, [if any,] whose names are noted on the assessment records as claimants of an interest in any such parcel.  The assessor of the municipality shall make a notation upon the records when requested to do so by any person claiming to have an interest in any parcel of property in the municipality.  The notice shall be published and mailed by certified mail by the municipal clerk, or by such clerk or official as the planning board shall otherwise designate.  Failure to mail any such notice shall [not] invalidate the investigation or determination thereon. (4) At the hearing, which may be adjourned from time to time, the planning board shall hear all persons who are interested in or would be affected by a determination that the delineated area is a redevelopment area. All objections to such a determination and evidence in support of those objections, given orally or in writing, shall be received and considered and made part of the public record. (5) (a)  After completing its hearing on this matter, the planning board shall recommend that the delineated area, or any part thereof, be determined, or not be determined, by the municipal governing body to be a redevelopment area.  In the event that the planning board does not recommend that the entire delineated area be designated as a redevelopment area, the planning board shall state its reasons, in writing, for not designating any property or properties, as proposed by the governing body. (b)   After receiving the recommendation of the planning board, the municipal governing body may adopt [a resolution] an ordinance determining that the delineated area, or any part thereof, is a redevelopment area. (c)   Upon the adoption of [a resolution] an ordinance, the clerk of the municipality shall, forthwith, transmit a copy of the [resolution] ordinance to the Commissioner of Community Affairs for review, along with the recommendations of the planning board.  If the area in need of redevelopment is not situated in an area in which development or redevelopment is to be encouraged pursuant to any State law or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, the determination shall not take effect without first receiving the review and the approval of the commissioner.  If the commissioner does not issue an approval or disapproval within 30 calendar days of transmittal by the clerk, the determination shall be deemed to be approved.  If the area in need of redevelopment is situated in an area in which development or redevelopment is to be encouraged pursuant to any State law or regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, then the determination shall take effect after the clerk has transmitted a copy of the [resolution] ordinance to the commissioner.  The determination, if supported by substantial evidence and, if required, approved by the commissioner, shall be binding and conclusive upon all persons affected by the determination. (d)   Notice of the determination shall be served, within 10 days after the determination, upon all record owners of property located within the delineated area, those whose names are listed on the tax assessor's records, and upon each person who filed a written objection thereto and stated, in or upon the written submission, an address to which notice of determination may be sent. (e)   If the governing body [resolution] ordinance assigning the investigation to the planning board, pursuant to subsection a. of this section, stated that the redevelopment determination shall establish a Condemnation Redevelopment Area, the notice of the determination required pursuant to subparagraph (d) of this paragraph shall indicate that: (i)    the determination operates as a finding of public purpose and authorizes the municipality to exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire property in the redevelopment area, and (ii)   legal action to challenge the determination must be commenced within 45 days of receipt of notice and that failure to do so shall preclude an owner from later raising such challenge. (f)   No municipality or redevelopment entity shall exercise the power of eminent domain to acquire property for redevelopment purposes within a Non-Condemnation Redevelopment Area. (g)   If a municipal governing body has determined an area to be a Non-Condemnation Redevelopment Area and is unable to acquire property that is necessary for the redevelopment project, the municipality may initiate and follow the process set forth in this section to determine whether the area or property is a Condemnation Redevelopment Area. Such determination shall be based upon the then-existing conditions and not based upon the condition of the area or property at the time of the prior Non-Condemnation Redevelopment Area determination. (h)   A property owner who has received notice pursuant to this section who does not file a legal challenge to the redevelopment determination affecting his or her property within 45 days of receipt of such notice shall thereafter be barred from filing such a challenge and, in the case of a Condemnation Redevelopment Area and upon compliance with the notice provisions of subparagraph (e) of this paragraph, shall further be barred from asserting a challenge to the redevelopment determination as a defense in any condemnation proceeding to acquire the property unless the municipality and the property owner agree otherwise. (6)   [The municipality shall, for 45 days next following its determination, take no further action to acquire any property by condemnation within the redevelopment area.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (7)   If any person shall, within 45 days after the adoption by the municipality of the determination, apply to the Superior Court, the court may grant further review of the determination by procedure in lieu of prerogative writ; and in any such action the court may make any incidental order that it deems proper. c.     An area determined to be in need of redevelopment pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be a "blighted area" for the purposes of Article VIII, Section III, paragraph 1 of the Constitution.  If an area is determined to be a redevelopment area and a redevelopment plan is adopted for that area in accordance with the provisions of this act, the municipality is authorized to utilize all those powers provided in section 8 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-8), except that a municipality may not acquire any land or building by condemnation pursuant to subsection c. of that section unless the land or building is located within (1) an area that was determined to be in need of redevelopment prior to the effective date of P.L.2013, c.159, or (2) a Condemnation Redevelopment Area for which the municipality has complied with the provisions of subparagraph (e) of paragraph (5) of subsection b. of this section. (cf: P.L.2013, c.159, s.2) 2.    (New section)  Each hearing notice circulated as required pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-6) shall include notice which shall be in substantially the following form: "PUBLIC ADVISORY STATEMENT The governing body of ...................... (insert name of municipality) in which you reside has authorized the planning board to undertake a study to determine whether your neighborhood fulfills the definition of a redevelopment area under New Jersey State law.  Your property has been included by your governing body in the proposed redevelopment area. State law requires those property owners whose properties are included within the redevelopment area to receive notice prior to the holding of a hearing by your municipal planning board.  The first hearing by the planning board will be held at ........ (insert time) on  ........... (insert date) at ................... (insert place). Municipalities are granted broad powers to facilitate economic development in a redevelopment area, including the acquisition of properties using eminent domain.  In other words, by being located in the redevelopment area, your property could be subject to condemnation. All interested persons are entitled to testify before the planning board under State law, either verbally or through written objection. All objections shall be made part of the public record.  Any determination by the governing body that an area is a redevelopment area is considered binding on all property owners included within the redevelopment area.  Any person who files a written objection to this determination is entitled to a copy of the determination within 10 days of municipal action. A property owner who filed a written objection to municipal declaration of a redevelopment area and who remains opposed to the declaration has 45 days following the declaration by the municipality to apply to the Superior Court for review of the municipal action. Any person seeking further clarification of your rights under the redevelopment law may contact the municipal clerk at ................. (insert telephone number) or the Commissioner of Community Affairs in Trenton at (609) 292-6420." 3.    Section 7 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-7) is amended to read as follows: 7.    a.  No redevelopment project shall be undertaken or carried out except in accordance with a redevelopment plan adopted by [ordinance of] the municipal governing body, [upon its finding] as provided in this section and section 4 of P.L.    , c.     (C.           ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The redevelopment plan shall be adopted by ordinance only after the municipal governing body has conducted at least one public hearing thereon following the receipt of the report of the planning board as required pursuant to section 4 of P.L.    , c. (C.           ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  In addition, the municipal governing body shall include within the ordinance detailed findings that the specifically delineated project area is located in an area in need of redevelopment or in an area in need of rehabilitation, or in both, according to criteria set forth in section 5 or section 14 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-5 or 40A:12A-14), as appropriate and that the plan fulfills all of the criteria set forth in this section. The redevelopment plan shall include an outline for the planning, development, redevelopment, or rehabilitation of the project area sufficient to indicate: (1)   Its relationship to definite local objectives as to appropriate land uses, density of population, and improved traffic and public transportation, public utilities, recreational and community facilities and other public improvements. (2)   Proposed land uses and building requirements in the project area. (3)   Adequate provision for the temporary and permanent relocation, as necessary, of residents in the project area, including an estimate of the extent to which decent, safe and sanitary dwelling units affordable to displaced residents will be available to them in the existing local housing market. (4)   An identification of any property within the redevelopment area which is proposed to be acquired in accordance with the redevelopment plan. (5)   Any significant relationship of the redevelopment plan to (a) the master plans of contiguous municipalities, (b) the master plan of the county in which the municipality is located, and (c) the State Development and Redevelopment Plan adopted pursuant to the "State Planning Act," P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.). (6)   As of the date of the adoption of the resolution finding the area to be in need of redevelopment, an inventory of all housing units affordable to low and moderate income households, as defined pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304), that are to be removed as a result of implementation of the redevelopment plan, whether as a result of subsidies or market conditions, listed by affordability level, number of bedrooms, and tenure. (7)   A plan for the provision, through new construction or substantial rehabilitation of one comparable, affordable replacement housing unit for each affordable housing unit that has been occupied at any time within the last 18 months, that is subject to affordability controls and that is identified as to be removed as a result of implementation of the redevelopment plan.  Displaced residents of housing units provided under any State or federal housing subsidy program, or pursuant to the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), provided they are deemed to be eligible, shall have first priority for those replacement units provided under the plan; provided that any such replacement unit shall not be credited against a prospective municipal obligation under the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), if the housing unit which is removed had previously been credited toward satisfying the municipal fair share obligation.  To the extent reasonably feasible, replacement housing shall be provided within or in close proximity to the redevelopment area.  A municipality shall report annually to the Department of Community Affairs on its progress in implementing the plan for provision of comparable, affordable replacement housing required pursuant to this section. (8)   Proposed locations for public electric vehicle charging infrastructure within the project area in a manner that appropriately connects with an essential public charging network. b.    A redevelopment plan may include the provision of affordable housing in accordance with the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) and the housing element of the municipal master plan. c.     The redevelopment plan shall describe its relationship to pertinent municipal development regulations as defined in the "Municipal Land Use Law," P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.).  The redevelopment plan shall supersede applicable provisions of the development regulations of the municipality or constitute an overlay zoning district within the redevelopment area.  When the redevelopment plan supersedes any provision of the development regulations, the ordinance adopting the redevelopment plan shall contain an explicit amendment to the zoning district map included in the zoning ordinance.  The zoning district map as amended shall indicate the redevelopment area to which the redevelopment plan applies.  [Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Municipal Land Use Law," P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) or of other law, no notice beyond that required for adoption of ordinances by the municipality shall be required for the hearing on or adoption of the redevelopment plan or subsequent amendments thereof.] d.    All provisions of the redevelopment plan shall be either substantially consistent with the municipal master plan or designed to effectuate the master plan; but the municipal governing body may adopt a redevelopment plan which is inconsistent with or not designed to effectuate the master plan by affirmative vote of a majority of its full authorized membership with the reasons for so acting set forth in the redevelopment plan. e.     Prior to the adoption of a redevelopment plan, or revision or amendment thereto, the governing body shall refer the plan, revision, or amendment, as appropriate, to the planning board [shall transmit to the governing body, within 45 days after referral, a report containing its recommendation concerning the redevelopment plan], which shall report back to the governing body within 90 days of referral, following a public hearing held by the planning board according to the procedure followed by the municipality in adopting the master plan, as required pursuant to subsection a. of section 19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28).  [This] The planning board report shall include an identification of any provisions in the proposed redevelopment plan which are inconsistent with the master plan and recommendations concerning these inconsistencies and any other matters as the board deems appropriate.  The governing body, when considering the adoption of a redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof, shall review the report of the planning board and may approve or disapprove or change any recommendation by a vote of a majority of its full authorized membership and shall record in its minutes the reasons for not following the recommendations. Failure of the planning board to transmit its report within the required [45] 90 days shall relieve the governing body from the requirements of this subsection with regard to the pertinent proposed redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof.  Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the applicability of the provisions of subsection d. of this section with respect to any redevelopment plan or revision or amendment thereof. f.     The governing body of a municipality may direct the planning board to prepare a redevelopment plan or an amendment or revision to a redevelopment plan for a designated redevelopment area.  After completing the redevelopment plan, the planning board shall transmit the proposed plan to the governing body for its adoption.  The governing body, when considering the proposed plan, may amend or revise any portion of the proposed redevelopment plan by an affirmative vote of the majority of its full authorized membership and shall record in its minutes the reasons for each amendment or revision.  When a redevelopment plan or amendment to a redevelopment plan is referred to the governing body by the planning board under this subsection, the governing body shall be relieved of the referral requirements of subsection e. of this section. Regardless of whether the redevelopment plan is prepared by the governing body or the planning board as provided in this subsection, the governing body shall not consider the proposed redevelopment plan or any amendment or revision thereto for a vote until it has complied with the notification and public hearing requirements set forth in section 4 of P.L.     , c.       (C.             ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2021, c.168, s.2) 4.    (New section)  a.  Prior to adopting the redevelopment plan, the governing body shall hold at least one public hearing on the redevelopment plan.  If the boundaries of the redevelopment area have been amended since the designation by the governing body of that area pursuant to paragraph (5) of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-6), the governing body shall prepare and include within the notice to be provided a revised map showing the boundaries of the redevelopment area and the location of the various parcels of property included therein. b.    Not less than 10 days prior to the public hearing, the governing body shall provide notice, specifying a date for and giving notice of a hearing for the purpose of hearing persons who are interested in or would be affected by the implementation of the redevelopment plan.  The hearing notice shall set forth the boundaries of the redevelopment area, including a map of the redevelopment area if the boundaries have changed, as required in subsection a. of this section, and state how interested members of the public can gain access to the proposed redevelopment plan, including the specific hours and location at which the plan may be inspected. c.     A copy of the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality once each week for two consecutive weeks, and the last publication shall be not less than 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing.  A copy of the notice shall be sent by certified mail, at least 14 days prior to the date set for the hearing to the last owner of each parcel of property within the area according to the assessment records of the municipality.  In the event that the boundaries of the redevelopment area have changed since the previous notice, notice also shall be provided to those owners previously situated within the redevelopment area.  A notice shall also be sent by certified mail to all persons at their last known address, whose names are noted on the assessment records as claimants of an interest in any such parcel.  The assessor of the municipality shall make a notation upon the records when requested to do so by any person claiming to have an interest in any parcel of property in the municipality.  The notice shall be published and mailed by the municipal clerk by certified mail, or by such clerk or official as the governing body shall otherwise designate. d.    At the hearing, which may be adjourned from time to time, the governing body shall hear all persons who are interested in or would be affected by the implementation of the redevelopment plan.  All objections to the plan and evidence in support of those objections, given orally or in writing, shall be received and considered and made part of the public record. 5.    Section 8 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-8) is amended to read as follows: 8.    Upon the adoption of a redevelopment plan pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-7), the municipality or redevelopment entity designated by the governing body may proceed with the clearance, replanning, development and redevelopment of the area designated in that plan.  In order to carry out and effectuate the purposes of this act and the terms of the redevelopment plan, the municipality or designated redevelopment entity may: a.     Undertake redevelopment projects, and for this purpose issue bonds in accordance with the provisions of section 29 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-29). b.    Acquire property pursuant to subsection i. of section 22 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-22). c.     Acquire, by condemnation, any land or building which is necessary for the redevelopment project, pursuant to the provisions of the "Eminent Domain Act of 1971," P.L.1971, c.361 (C.20:3-1 et seq.), provided that the land or building is located within (1) an area that was determined to be in need of redevelopment prior to the effective date of P.L.2013, c.159, or (2) a Condemnation Redevelopment Area. d.    Clear any area owned or acquired and install, construct or reconstruct streets, facilities, utilities, and site improvements essential to the preparation of sites for use in accordance with the redevelopment plan. e.     Prepare or arrange by contract for the provision of professional services and the preparation of plans by registered architects, licensed professional engineers or planners, or other consultants for the carrying out of redevelopment projects. f.     Arrange or contract with public agencies or redevelopers for the planning, replanning, construction, or undertaking of any project or redevelopment work, or any part thereof; negotiate and collect revenue from a redeveloper to defray the costs of the redevelopment entity, including where applicable the costs incurred in conjunction with bonds, notes or other obligations issued by the redevelopment entity, and to secure payment of such revenue; as part of any such arrangement or contract, provide for extension of credit, or making of loans, to redevelopers to finance any project or redevelopment work, or upon a finding that the project or redevelopment work would not be undertaken but for the provision of financial assistance, or would not be undertaken in its intended scope without the provision of financial assistance, provide as part of an arrangement or contract for capital grants to redevelopers; and arrange or contract with public agencies or redevelopers for the opening, grading or closing of streets, roads, roadways, alleys, or other places or for the furnishing of facilities or for the acquisition by such agency of property options or property rights or for the furnishing of property or services in connection with a redevelopment area. g.    Except with regard to property subject to the requirements of P.L.2008, c.65 (C.40A:5-14.2 et al.), lease or convey property or improvements to any other party pursuant to this section [, without public bidding and at such prices and upon such terms as it deems reasonable], provided that the lease or conveyance is made in conjunction with a redevelopment plan [, notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary]. h.    Enter upon any building or property in any redevelopment area in order to conduct investigations or make surveys, sounding or test borings necessary to carry out the purposes of this act. i.     Arrange or contract with a public agency for the relocation, pursuant to the "Relocation Assistance Law of 1967," P.L.1967, c.79 (C.52:31B-1 et seq.) and the "Relocation Assistance Act," P.L.1971, c.362 (C.20:4-1 et seq.), of residents, industry or commerce displaced from a redevelopment area. j.     Make, consistent with the redevelopment plan: (1) plans for carrying out a program of voluntary repair and rehabilitation of buildings and improvements;

(cf: P.L.2013, c.159, s.3) 6.    Section 14 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-14) is amended to read as follows: 14.  a.  A delineated area may be determined to be in need of rehabilitation if the governing body of the municipality determines by [resolution] ordinance that a program of rehabilitation, as defined in section 3 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-3), may be expected to prevent further deterioration and promote the overall development of the community; and that there exist in that area any of the following conditions such that (1) a significant portion of structures therein are in a deteriorated or substandard condition; (2) more than half of the housing stock in the delineated area is at least 50 years old; (3) there is a pattern of vacancy, abandonment or underutilization of properties in the area; (4) there is a persistent arrearage of property tax payments on properties in the area; (5) environmental contamination is discouraging improvements and investment in properties in the area; or (6) a majority of the water and sewer infrastructure in the delineated area is at least 50 years old and is in need of repair or substantial maintenance.  Where warranted by consideration of the overall conditions and requirements of the community, a finding of need for rehabilitation may extend to the entire area of a municipality.  Prior to adoption of the [resolution] ordinance, the governing body shall submit it to the municipal planning board for its review.  Within [45] 90 days of its receipt of the proposed [resolution] ordinance, the municipal planning board shall submit its recommendations regarding the proposed [resolution] ordinance, including any modifications which it may recommend, to the governing body for its consideration.  Thereafter, or after the expiration of the [45] 90 days if the municipal planning board does not submit recommendations, the governing body may adopt the [resolution] ordinance, with or without modification.  The [resolution] ordinance shall not become effective without the approval of the commissioner pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-6), if otherwise required pursuant to that section. b.    A delineated area shall be deemed to have been determined to be an area in need of rehabilitation in accordance with the provisions of this act if it has heretofore been determined to be an area in need of rehabilitation pursuant to P.L.1975, c.104 (C.54:4-3.72 et seq.), P.L.1977, c.12 (C.54:4-3.95 et seq.) or P.L.1979, c.233 (C.54:4-3.121 et al.). c.     (1)  A municipality may adopt an ordinance declaring a renovation housing project to be an area in need of rehabilitation for the purposes of Article VIII, Section I, paragraph 6 of the New Jersey Constitution if the need for renovation resulted from conflagration. (2)   For the purposes of this subsection, "renovation housing project" means any work or undertaking to provide a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling, to exclusively benefit a specific household, by the renovation, reconstruction, or replacement of the household's home on the same lot by either a charitable entity organized to perform home renovations or by a for-profit builder using [75%] 75 percent or more volunteer labor-hours to accomplish the construction for the project. The undertaking may include any buildings; demolition, clearance, or removal of buildings from land; equipment; facilities; or other personal properties or interests therein which are necessary, convenient, or desirable appurtenances of the undertaking. d.    (1)  A municipality may adopt an ordinance declaring a renovation housing project to be an area in need of rehabilitation for the purposes of Article VIII, Section I, paragraph 6 of the New Jersey Constitution if at least half of the number of people occupying the dwelling as their primary residence qualify for a federal income tax credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C. s.22 as a result of being permanently and totally disabled and the improvements to be made to the dwelling are made substantially to accommodate those disabilities. (2)   For the purposes of this subsection, "renovation housing project" means any work or undertaking to provide a decent, safe, and sanitary single-family dwelling, to exclusively benefit at least half of the number of people occupying a dwelling as their primary residence, by the renovation, reconstruction, or replacement of that dwelling on the same lot by either a charitable entity organized to perform home renovations or by a for-profit builder using [75%] 75 percent or more volunteer labor-hours to accomplish the construction for the project. The undertaking may include any buildings; demolition, clearance, or removal of buildings from land; equipment; facilities; or other personal properties or interests therein which are necessary, convenient, or desirable appurtenances of the undertaking. (cf: P.L.2013, c.159, s.4) 7.    Section 13 of P.L.1971, c.199 (C.40A:12-13) is amended to read as follows: 13.  [Sales of real property, capital improvements or personal property; exceptions; procedure.] Any county or municipality may sell any real property, capital improvement or personal property, or interests therein, not needed for public use, as set forth in the resolution or ordinance authorizing the sale, other than county or municipal lands, real property otherwise dedicated or restricted pursuant to law, and, except as otherwise provided by law, all such sales shall be made by one of the following methods: (a)   By open public sale at auction to the highest bidder after advertisement thereof in a newspaper circulating in the municipality or municipalities in which the lands are situated, by two insertions at least once a week during two consecutive weeks, the last publication to be not earlier than seven days prior to such sale.  In the case of public sales, the governing body may by resolution fix a minimum price or prices, with or without the reservation of the right to reject all bids where the highest bid is not accepted.  Notice of such reservation shall be included in the advertisement of the sale and public notice thereof shall be given at the time of sale. Such resolution may provide, without fixing a minimum price, that upon the completion of the bidding, the highest bid may be accepted or all the bids may be rejected.  The invitation to bid may also impose restrictions on the use to be made of such real property, capital improvement or personal property, and any conditions of sale as to buildings or structures, or as to the type, size, or other specifications of buildings or structures to be constructed thereon, or as to demolition, repair, or reconstruction of buildings or structures, and the time within which such conditions shall be operative, or any other conditions of sale, in like manner and to the same extent as by any other vendor.  Such conditions shall be included in the advertisement, as well as the nature of the interest retained by the county or municipality.  Such restrictions or conditions shall be related to a lawful public purpose and encourage and promote fair and competitive bidding of the county or municipality and shall not, in the case of a municipality, be inconsistent with or impose a special or higher standard than any zoning ordinance or building, plumbing, electrical, or similar code or ordinance then in effect in the municipality. In any case in which a county or municipality intends to retain an estate or interest in any real property, capital improvement or personal property, in the nature of an easement, contingent or reversionary, the invitation to bid and the advertisement required herein shall require each bidder to submit one bid under each Option A and Option B below. (1)   Option A shall be for the real property, capital improvement or personal property subject to the conditions or restrictions imposed, or interest or estate retained, which the county or municipality proposes to retain or impose. (2)   Option B shall be for the real property, capital improvement or personal property to be sold free of all such restrictions, conditions, interests or estates on the part of the county or municipality. The county or the municipality may elect or reject either or both options and the highest bid for each.  Such acceptance or rejection shall be made not later than at the second regular meeting of the governing body following the sale, and, if the governing body shall not so accept such highest bid, or reject all bids, said bids shall be deemed to have been rejected.  Any such sale may be adjourned at the time advertised for not more than one week without readvertising. (b)   At private sale, when authorized by resolution, in the case of a county, or by ordinance, in the case of a municipality, in the following cases: (1)   A sale to any political subdivision, agency, department, commission, board or body corporate and politic of the State of New Jersey or to an interstate agency or body of which the State of New Jersey is a member or to the United States of America or any department or agency thereof. (2)   A sale to a person submitting a bid pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, where all bids have been rejected, provided that the terms and price agreed to shall in no event be less than the highest bid rejected, and provided further that the terms and conditions of sale shall remain identical. (3)   A sale by any county or municipality, when it has or shall have conveyed its right, title and interest in any real property, capital improvement or personal property not needed for public use, and it was assumed and intended that there should be conveyed a good and sufficient title in fee simple to said real property, capital improvement or personal property, free of all encumbrances and the full consideration has been paid therefor, and it shall thereafter appear that the title conveyed was insufficient or that said county or municipality at the time of said conveyance was not the owner of some estate or interest in said real property, capital improvement or personal property or of some encumbrances thereon, and the county or municipality shall thereafter acquire a good and sufficient title in fee simple, free of all encumbrances of said real property, capital improvement or personal property or shall acquire such outstanding estate or interest therein or outstanding encumbrance thereon and said county or municipality, by resolution of the governing body and without the payment of any additional consideration, has deemed to convey or otherwise transfer to said purchaser, his heirs or assigns, such after-acquired title, or estate or interest in, or encumbrance upon, such real property, capital improvement or personal property to perfect the title or interest previously conveyed. (4)   A sale of an easement upon any real property previously conveyed by any county or municipality may be made when the governing body of any county, by resolution, or any municipality, by ordinance, has elected to release the public rights in the nature of easements, in, on, over or under any real property within the county or the municipality, as the case may be, upon such terms as shall be agreed upon with the owner of such lands, if the use of such rights is no longer desirable, necessary or required for public purposes. (5)   A sale to the owner of the real property contiguous to the real property being sold; provided that the property being sold is less than the minimum size required for development under the municipal zoning ordinance and is without any capital improvement thereon; except that when there is more than one owner with real property contiguous thereto, said property shall be sold to the highest bidder from among all such owners.  Any such sale shall be for not less than the fair market value of said real property. When there is only one owner with real property contiguous to the property being sold, and the property is less than an eighth of the minimum size required for development under the municipal zoning ordinance and is without any capital improvement thereon, the fair market value of that property may be determined by negotiation between the local unit and the owner of the contiguous real property.  The negotiated sum shall be subject to approval by resolution of the governing body, but in no case shall that sum be less than one dollar. In the case of any sale of real property hereafter made pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, in no event shall the price agreed upon with the owner be less than the difference between the highest bid accepted for the real property subject to easements (Option A) and the highest bid rejected for the real property not subject to easements (Option B).  After the adoption of the resolution or ordinance, and compliance by the owner of said real property with the terms thereof, said real property shall be free, and entirely discharged of and from such rights of the public and of the county or municipality, as the case may be, but no such release shall affect the right of lawful occupancy or use of any such real property by any municipal or private utility to occupy or use any such real property lawfully occupied or used by it.  A list of the property so authorized to be sold, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, together with the minimum prices, respectively, as determined by the governing body, shall be included in the resolution or ordinance authorizing the sale, and said list shall be posted on the bulletin board or other conspicuous space in the building which the governing body usually holds its regular meetings, and advertisement thereof made in a newspaper circulating in the municipality or municipalities in which the real property, capital improvement or personal property is situated, within five days following enactment of said resolution or ordinance.  Offers for any or all properties so listed may thereafter be made to the governing body or its designee for a period of 20 days following the advertisement herein required, at not less than said minimum prices, by any prospective purchaser, real estate broker, or other authorized representative. In any such case, the governing body may reconsider its resolution or ordinance, not later than 30 days after its enactment, and advertise the real property, capital improvement, or personal property in question for public sale pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. Any county or municipality selling any real property, capital improvement or personal property pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall file with the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs, sworn affidavits verifying the publication of advertisements as required by this subsection. (c)   [By private sale of a municipality in the following case:  A sale to a private developer by a municipality, when acting in accordance with the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.).] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (d)   A county or municipality is also authorized to use electronic procurement practices in accordance with the provisions of P.L.2018, c.156 (C.40A:11-4.7 et al.) for the sale or lease of real property pursuant to the "Local Lands and Buildings Law," P.L.1971, c.199 (C.40A:12-1 et seq.). All sales, either public or private, may be made for cash or upon credit.  A deposit not exceeding [10%] 10 percent of the minimum price or value of the property to be sold may be required of all bidders.  When made upon credit, the county or municipality may accept a purchase-money mortgage, upon terms and conditions which shall be fixed by the resolution of the governing body; provided, however, that such mortgage shall be fully payable within five years from the date of the sale and shall bear interest at a rate equal to that authorized under Title 31 of the Revised Statutes, as amended and supplemented, and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, or the rate last paid by the county or municipality upon any issue of notes pursuant to the "Local Bond Law" (N.J.S.40A:2-1 et seq.), whichever is higher.  The governing body may, by resolution, fix the time for closing of title and payment of the consideration. In all sales made pursuant to this section, the governing body of any county or municipality may provide for the payment of a commission to any real estate broker, or authorized representative other than the purchaser actually consummating such sale; provided, however, that no commission shall be paid unless notice of the governing body's intention to pay such a commission shall have been included in the advertisement of sale and the recipient thereof shall have filed an affidavit with the governing body stating that said recipient is not the purchaser.  Said commissions shall not exceed, in the aggregate, [5%] 5 percent of the sale price, and be paid, where there has been a public sale, only in the event that the sum of the commission and the highest bid price does not exceed the next highest bid price (exclusive of any real estate broker's commission). As used in this section, "purchaser" shall mean and include any person, corporation, company, association, society, firm, partnership, or other business entity owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, more than [10%] 10 percent of the purchasing entity. (cf: P.L.2018, c.156, s.7) 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would make procedural modifications to the process through which municipalities exercise redevelopment power. First, the bill would require that municipalities act by ordinance rather than resolution in acting under the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.).  This would require a more elaborate publication and hearing process than that which is required when a municipality acts by resolution. The bill enhances notification requirements under this law. Under current law, when a municipal governing body designates properties within a redevelopment area, it is required to authorize the planning board to undertake a preliminary investigation to determine whether the proposed area fulfills those criteria which the law establishes in order to be so designated. Although the current law does provide for notification when an area is to be designated, the hearing notice is only required to set forth the general boundaries of the area to be investigated and notice that the map shall be made available at the office of the municipal clerk.  Property owners in the proposed redevelopment area are to be notified by regular mail, under the current law, with no information to be provided as to what a redevelopment designation means. This bill would require that the hearing notice clearly delineate the properties which are to be included in the redevelopment area and that notice to property owners be provided by certified mail.  In addition, the bill requires that a Public Advisory Statement be sent to every property owner within the redevelopment area as part of the required notification and prescribes the content of this statement.  The purpose of this Public Advisory Statement is to explain to property owners within the redevelopment area that municipalities are granted broad powers to facilitate economic development within redevelopment areas, which includes the power to exercise eminent domain.  Additionally, the notification is designed to inform property owners of their recourse in this situation and who to contact for further information. The bill requires both the planning board and municipal governing body to hold public hearings on the redevelopment plan, which is required to be prepared before a municipality is authorized to undertake a redevelopment project under existing law.  In addition, the bill requires that property owners within the designated redevelopment area be provided with certified mail notice in advance of the public hearing held by the municipal governing body.  Under current law, the redevelopment plan is to be adopted by ordinance and the municipality is only required to provide that notice associated with the adoption of an ordinance under general law. Under current law, when the governing body originates the redevelopment plan, it is required to transmit a copy of the proposed redevelopment plan to the planning board for recommendations and an analysis of the consistency of that plan with the municipal master plan.  The law gives the planning board 45 days within which to report back to the governing body.  Given the addition of a mandatory public hearing process by this bill, this 45 day review period is extended to 90 days. Current law authorizes municipalities to lease or convey property or improvements "without public bidding and at such prices and upon such terms as it deems reasonable." By removing this exception from public bidding and vague language deferring to the municipality as to the establishment of a price for such property or improvements, this bill would require open public bidding and, thereby, the establishment of a market price through a transparent transaction process.
