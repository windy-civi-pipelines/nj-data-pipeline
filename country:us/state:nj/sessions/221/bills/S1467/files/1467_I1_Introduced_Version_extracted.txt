School psychologists assist educators in implementing safe, healthy classroom and school environments by providing students with a wide range of emotional and academic services. This bill ensures that students who are unable to attend in-person sessions, for whatever reason, will continue to have access to their school psychologist by offering virtual or remote counseling sessions.
