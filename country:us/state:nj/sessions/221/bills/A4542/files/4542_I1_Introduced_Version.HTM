(3)   [under circumstances that caused any victim of the underlying offense to be intimidated and the victim, considering the manner in which the offense was committed, reasonably believed either that (a) the offense was committed with a purpose to intimidate the victim or any person or entity in whose welfare the victim is interested because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity, or (b) the victim or the victim's property was selected to be the target of the offense because of the victim's race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity.] Deleted by amendment, P.L.     , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) b.    Permissive inference concerning selection of targeted person or property.  Proof that the target of the underlying offense was selected by the defendant, or by another acting in concert with the defendant, because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity shall give rise to a permissive inference by the trier of fact that the defendant acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity. c.     Grading.  Bias intimidation is a crime of the fourth degree if the underlying offense referred to in subsection a. is a disorderly persons offense or petty disorderly persons offense.  Otherwise, bias intimidation is a crime one degree higher than the most serious underlying crime referred to in subsection a., except that where the underlying crime is a crime of the first degree, bias intimidation is a first-degree crime and the defendant upon conviction thereof may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, be sentenced to an ordinary term of imprisonment between 15 years and 30 years, with a presumptive term of 20 years. d.    Gender exemption in sexual offense prosecutions.  It shall not be a violation of subsection a. if the underlying criminal offense is a violation of chapter 14 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes and the circumstance specified in paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of subsection a. of this section is based solely upon the gender of the victim. e.     Merger.

(cf: P.L.2020, c.73, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill expands the list of crimes that are a form of bias intimidation to include the crime of creating a false public alarm under N.J.S.2C:33-3. Under current law, a person is guilty of the crime of bias intimidation if he commits, attempts to commit, conspires with another to commit, or threatens the immediate commission of certain offenses, which include terroristic threats, assault, murder, arson, harassment, and certain weapons offenses, with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity. The bill also removes paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:16-1 from the statute.  In State v. Pomianek, 221 N.J. 66 (2015), the New Jersey Supreme Court held that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and violates due process because, rather than focusing on the defendants state of mind, the law focuses on the victims perception of the defendants state of mind. Depending upon the circumstances, the crime of creating a false public alarm can range from a fourth degree to a first degree crime. Bias intimidation is a crime of the fourth degree if the underlying offense is a disorderly persons offense or petty disorderly persons offense.  Otherwise, bias intimidation is a crime graded one degree higher than the most serious underlying crime, except in cases in which the underlying crime is of the first degree.  A crime of the fourth degree is typically punishable by a term of up to 18 months imprisonment, a fine up to $10,000, or both.  A crime of the first degree is typically punishable by a term of 10 to 20 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.  A conviction for bias intimidation as a first-degree crime may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, be an ordinary term of imprisonment between 15 years and 30 years, with a presumptive term of 20 years.
