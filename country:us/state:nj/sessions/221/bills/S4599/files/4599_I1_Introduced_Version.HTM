Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited
as the New Jersey Workforce Housing Partnership Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Housing affordability
remains a major challenge for middle-class workers, including teachers, first
responders, healthcare workers, and young professionals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Employers in high-cost
areas within the State continue to struggle to attract and retain skilled
workers due to unaffordable housing options.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Public-private
partnerships can bridge the gap between wages and home ownership by
incentivizing employer-sponsored housing assistance through the implementation
of workforce housing programs that prioritize long-term affordability while
preventing displacement of existing residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Municipal governments
can benefit from a <a name="KVWin_undoend"></a>broader tax base through the
development of workforce housing and the revitalization of underutilized
commercial spaces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Municipalities in which
there are underutilized commercial spaces that may be developed into workforce
housing pursuant to P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill) are hereby declared areas in need
of rehabilitation, provided, however, that this declaration alone shall not be
used to allow any property to be taken or acquired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     To address the State
housing affordability issues, it is necessary to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   establish a Workforce
Housing Assistance Program to provide State grants to match employer-provided
down payment assistance and low-interest mortgage options;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   offer tax incentives to
businesses that contribute to their employees homeownership;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   encourage the
development of workforce housing by employers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   incentivize municipal
participation through zoning flexibility;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   ensure affordability
protections for low- and middle-income residents; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   encourage private sector
involvement through developer incentives and banking partnerships.</p>

Jersey Economic Development Authority established by section 4 of P.L.1974, c.80
(C.34:1B-4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Eligibility period means the
period, as specified in an incentive award agreement, during which a qualified
employer may claim tax credits, as such credits and period shall be determined
by the authority pursuant to section 9 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, designated as the
New Jersey Workforce Housing Partnership Act, incentivizes employers to
provide financial assistance to certain employees buying homes, provides tax
credits for the development of certain workforce housing projects, and provides
certain assistance and affordability protections for low- and moderate-income
residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>The Workforce Housing Assistance
Program</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the New
Jersey Economic Development Authority (authority) to establish a Workforce
Housing Assistance Program (program) to provide incentives to qualified
employers related to the provision of workforce housing assistance to qualified
employees.  The program consists of two components:  (1) the provision of
matching contribution grants for down-payment assistance provided by a
qualified employer to one or more qualified employees; and (2) the provision of
low-interest mortgage loans and loan guarantees to the qualified employees of a
qualified employer for the purchase of workforce housing in this State.  Under
the bill, qualified employers are required to apply to the authority to
participate in the program before the qualified employees of the employer may
receive benefits under either component of the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As defined in the bill, qualified
employee means a full-time employee of a qualified employer who has worked for
the qualified employer for a minimum of one calendar year prior to the
employers date of application for the program, which employee is middle-income
or a member of a middle-income household.  Qualified employer means a person
or business entity doing business in the State, which person or business entity
employs one or more qualified employees residing within this State.  Workforce
housing means housing that is affordable, according to federal Department of
Housing and Urban Development or other recognized standards, for home ownership
and rental costs and that is occupied or reserved for occupancy by households
with a gross household income not more than 120 percent of the median gross
household income for households of the same size within the housing region in
which the housing is located.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes the
provision of matching contribution grants for distribution to qualified
employees who receive a financial contribution of at least $5,000 from a
qualified employer toward a down payment for the purchase of a workforce
housing unit.  However, to qualify for the matching contribution grant, the
purchase of the workforce housing unit is required to occur within 12 months
following the qualified employers approval for the program, and the property
is required to be occupied as the qualified employees principal residence. 
Under the bill, the amount of the matching contribution grant is to equal:  (1)
for a qualified employer that employs 50 or more employees, an amount equal to
the financial contribution paid by the qualified employer to the qualified
employee, but not to exceed $10,000 per employee; or (2) for a qualified
employer that employs fewer than 50 employees, in an amount equal to 200
percent of the financial contribution paid by the employer to the qualified
employer, but not to exceed $15,000 per employee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to receiving
grants under the program, this bill authorizes qualified employees of a
qualified employer that is approved to participate in the program to apply to the
authority for a low-interest mortgage loan or loan guarantee for the purchase
of a workforce housing unit, which purchase occurs within 12 months of the date
of approval of the qualified employers application for the program, and which
housing is to be occupied as the qualified employees primary residence in this
State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides corporation
business tax and gross income tax credits for qualified employers that provide
financial contributions for down payment assistance to qualified employees, in
accordance with the requirements of the program.  Under the bill, the tax
credits are to be issued in an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount of the
taxpayers financial contributions, not to exceed $500,000 during a tax period.
 However, for a taxpayer that employs fewer than 50 employees, an additional amount
of tax credits is available equal to 10 percent of the amount of the taxpayers
financial contributions paid in excess of $5,000 to each qualified employee
during a tax period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Periodic Program Review and
Funding of the Program</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill appropriates $50 million
to the Workforce Housing Assistance Program Fund, which is established under
the bill for the purposes of providing grants, low-interest loans, and loan
guarantees under the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the authority,
in coordination with the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (agency),
is required to review on the effectiveness of the program every three years,
which review is to include:  (1) the impact of the program on employee
retention in the State; (2) the rates of participation in the program by
qualified employers; (3) the rates of participation in the program by qualified
employers with fewer than 50 employees; (4) the rates of homeownership by
qualified employees in the State; and (5) any other measure by which the
authority determines the success of the program may best be studied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The authority, in coordination
with the agency, is required to report its findings and recommend the
continuation, modification, or termination of the Workforce Housing Assistance
Program, including any recommended changes to funding for the program, to the
Governor and the Legislature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Workforce Housing Development
Incentive</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides for
incentive awards in the form of tax credits, and potentially tax abatements,
for qualified employers that convert underutilized commercial property into a workforce
housing project.  The bill defines workforce housing project as a residential
housing project developed or financed by a qualified employer that primarily
includes workforce housing and includes a minimum set-aside of 20 percent of
units for households earning not more than 80 percent of the area median income
determined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To receive an incentive award
for the development of a workforce housing project, a qualified employer is
required to demonstrate the following in an application to the authority:  (1) the
applicant is a qualified employer that seeks to convert underutilized
commercial property into a workforce housing project; (2) evidence satisfactory
to the authority that the development of the workforce housing project is in
compliance with applicable State and federal laws and safety standards; (3) the
anticipated project costs to be incurred by the qualified employer in
developing the workforce housing project; (4) assurances deemed satisfactory to
the authority that a minimum of 20 percent of units in the project will be set
aside for low- and moderate-income households; and (5) any other information
required by the authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a developer
that executes an incentive award agreement with the authority may receive tax
credits as authorized under the agreement, subject to the approval of annual
compliance reports submitted to the authority.  After issuance of the
certificate of compliance by the authority, the taxpayer is permitted to claim
tax credits in an amount not to exceed 15 percent of approved project costs, as
defined in the bill, for the development of a workforce housing project, which
credits may be claimed over the course of an eligibility period, as determined
by the authority.  The bill also allows a taxpayer to apply for a tax credit
transfer certificate so that all or part of the credit awarded may be sold or
assigned to a third-party purchaser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
authorizes a municipality to adopt an ordinance granting an abatement or
exemption from taxation, or both, for property in development for the purpose
of workforce housing a developer that converts underutilized commercial
property into workforce housing or develops on-site workforce housing for
qualified employees.  If such ordinance is adopted, a developer may be eligible
for a five-year tax abatement as described in the bill, subject to the
requirement to make payments in lieu of taxes to the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Zoning and Permitting
Requirements</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes the
adoption of certain municipal ordinances and requires that the adoption of such
ordinances be a priority consideration for the Commissioner of Transportation (commissioner)
when determining allocations of certain transportation funding for municipal
projects within each county.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
provides that under the local aid program, the commissioner is required to
determine priority for the funding, after the amount of aid has been allocated
based primarily on the statutory formula, based upon whether a municipality has
adopted an ordinance that permits the development of certain accessory dwelling
units, development of duplexes and triplexes in an area zoned for single-family
residential use, or mixed-use development.  The commissioner remains required,
as under current law, to consider criteria relating to volume of traffic,
safety considerations, growth potential, readiness to obligate funds, and local
taxing capacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, this bill
accelerates the processing timelines for certain permits necessary to the
development of workforce housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Workforce Housing Impact Relief
Program</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes a
Workforce Housing Impact Relief Program (relief program) in the authority for
the purpose of providing grants, in such amounts as may be determined by the
authority, to certain long-term homeowners that reside in municipalities
impacted by the development of one or more workforce housing projects.  An
individual is eligible for the relief program, provided that only one
application may be approved in any household in any calendar year, if:  (1) the
individuals household earns not more than 80 percent of the area median income
determined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development; and (2)
the individuals primary residence is located in a municipality impacted by the
development of workforce housing under the bill, and the individual has owned
the principal residence for not less than 10 years prior to the date of
application for the relief program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To fund these grants, the bill
appropriates $5 million to the Workforce Housing Impact Relief Fund, which the
authority is to establish pursuant to the bill.</p>
