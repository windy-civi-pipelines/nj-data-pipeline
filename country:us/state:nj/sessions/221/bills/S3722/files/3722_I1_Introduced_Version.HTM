<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Financier&quot; means a
person who, with the intent to derive a profit, provides money or credit or
other thing of value in order to purchase a controlled dangerous substance or
an immediate precursor, or otherwise to finance the operations of a drug
trafficking network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person is a leader of a
narcotics trafficking network if he conspires with two or more other persons in
a scheme or course of conduct to unlawfully manufacture, distribute, dispense,
bring into or transport in this State methamphetamine, lysergic acid
diethylamide, phencyclidine, gamma hydroxybutyrate, flunitrazepam or any
controlled dangerous substance classified in Schedule I or II, or any
controlled substance analog thereof as a financier, or as an organizer,

before being eligible for parole<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-3, the court may
also impose a fine not to exceed $750,000.00 or five times the street value of
the controlled dangerous substance, controlled substance analog, gamma
hydroxybutyrate or flunitrazepam involved, whichever is greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding the provisions
of N.J.S.2C:1-8, a conviction of leader of narcotics trafficking network shall
not merge with the conviction for any offense which is the object of the
conspiracy. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the court from
imposing an extended term pursuant to N.J.S.2C:43-7; nor shall this section be
construed in any way to preclude or limit the prosecution or conviction of any
person for conspiracy under N.J.S.2C:5-2, or any prosecution or conviction
under N.J.S.2C:35-4 (maintaining or operating a CDS production facility),
N.J.S.2C:35-5 (manufacturing, distributing or dispensing), N.J.S.2C:35-6

any prosecution under this section for the State to prove that any intended
profit was actually realized. The trier of fact may infer that a particular
scheme or course of conduct was undertaken for profit from all of the attendant
circumstances, including but not limited to the number of persons involved in
the scheme or course of conduct, the actor's net worth and his expenditures in
relation to his legitimate sources of income, the amount or purity of the
specified controlled dangerous substance, controlled substance analog, gamma
hydroxybutyrate or flunitrazepam involved, or the amount of cash or currency
involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It shall not be a defense to a
prosecution under this section that such controlled dangerous substance,
controlled substance analog, gamma hydroxybutyrate or flunitrazepam was brought
into or transported in this State solely for ultimate distribution or
dispensing in another jurisdiction; nor shall it be a defense that any profit
was intended to be made in another jurisdiction.</p>

the defendant was subject to the supervision or management of another, nor that
another person or persons were also leaders of the narcotics trafficking network.</p>
