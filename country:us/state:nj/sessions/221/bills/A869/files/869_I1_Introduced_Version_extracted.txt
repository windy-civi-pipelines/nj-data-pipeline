(cf: P.L.1954, c.48, s.4) 2.    (New section)  a.  Any contract for services to be performed by a contractor personally which are of a technical and professional nature, other than a contract for architectural, engineering and land surveying services awarded pursuant to P.L.1997, c.399 (C.52:34-9.1 et seq.), that is to be awarded by a State agency shall be publicly announced prior to being awarded and contracts for these services shall be negotiated on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of technical and professional service required and at fair and reasonable compensation and awarded pursuant to a competitive contracting process in the manner provided by this section. b.    A professional firm that wishes to be qualified to provide technical and professional services to a State agency seeking to negotiate a contract or agreement for the performance of those services shall file with the agency a current statement of qualifications and supporting data. The statement may be filed at any time during a calendar year, and a $100 fee shall be remitted to the State Treasurer each time a statement is filed. The content of any such statement shall conform to such regulations with respect thereto as the State Treasurer, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c. 410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall promulgate.  No statement that shall have been filed more than two years prior to the publication of an advertisement pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be a current statement with respect to qualifications of the firm. c.     Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a contract or agreement with an agency for the procurement of technical and professional services shall be publicly advertised prior to the solicitation of proposals or expressions of interest from interested firms.  To the extent consistent with the purposes and provisions of this section, the advertisement shall conform to the requirements applicable under subsections (a) and (b) of section 7 of P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-12) or may be publicly advertised through electronic means.  The advertisement shall include a statement of the criteria by which the agency seeking to procure those services shall evaluate the qualifications of professional firms and determine the order of preference to be used in designating the firms most highly qualified to perform the services.  In addition, the advertisement shall include notice that professional firms wishing to be considered for selection as a potential provider of such services in connection with a proposed project must have submitted to the agency a current statement of qualifications and supporting data as provided in this section. d.    For each proposed contract, an agency shall evaluate current statements of qualifications and supporting data on file with the agency.  The agency may solicit proposals or expressions of interest unique to the specific contract that would in narrative form outline concepts and methods of approach to the contract.  The agency shall select, in order of preference, based upon the criteria included in the advertisement required by this section, at least three professional firms deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required, except that the agency may select fewer professional firms if fewer such firms responded to the solicitation or meet the qualifications required for the project. e.     An agency which intends or expects to make, negotiate or award a contract or agreement for the procurement of technical and professional services shall, before publishing an advertisement of notice with respect  to any such contract or agreement, have adopted by regulation and have promulgated, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the criteria by which it shall make, with respect to any such contract or agreement, the selection of qualified firms as prescribed by this section. f.     Once the top three or more ranked firms have been identified, each firm, at the request of the agency, shall submit a fee proposal.  The firms shall not be told of their ranking position at that time.  Using the three fee proposals to provide a general guideline, an agency shall negotiate a contract with the most qualified professional firm at compensation which the agency determines to be fair and reasonable to the State of New Jersey.  In making this determination, the agency shall take into account the estimated value of the services to be rendered and the scope, complexity, and professional nature thereof.  Should the agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the professional firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee the agency determines to be fair and reasonable, negotiations with that professional firm shall be formally terminated.  The agency shall then undertake negotiations with the second most qualified professional firm.  Failing accord with the second most qualified professional firm, the agency shall formally terminate negotiations.  The agency shall then undertake negotiations with the third most qualified professional firm.  Should the agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected professional firms, it shall select additional professional firms in order of their competence and qualifications and it shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached. g.    Nothing in this section shall preclude a State agency from using procurement processes other than those prescribed herein if those processes are required by the federal government or if an emergency has been declared by the chief executive officer of the agency . h.    As used in this section, "State agency" or agency means any of the

Any purpose included herein shall not be considered by a board of education as an extraordinary unspecifiable service pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of N.J.S.18A:18A-5. (cf: P.L.2009, c.4, s.2) 8.    (New section)  a.  It is the policy of this State that contracts to be awarded by a board of education, as defined in N.J.S.18A:18A-2, for architectural, engineering and land surveying services shall be publicly announced prior to being awarded and that contracts for these services shall be negotiated on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services required and at fair and reasonable compensation. b.    As used in this section: "Compensation" means the basis of payment by a board of education for professional architectural, engineering or land surveying services; "Professional firm" means any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association or other legal entity permitted by law to provide professional architectural, engineering, or land surveying services in this State; and "Professional architectural, engineering and land surveying services" means those services, including planning, environmental, and  construction inspection services required for the development and construction of projects, within the scope of the practice of architecture, professional engineering or professional land surveying as defined by the laws of this State or those performed by an architect, professional engineer or professional land surveyor in connection with his professional employment practice. c.     A professional firm which wishes to be considered qualified to provide professional architectural, engineering, or land surveying services to a board of education seeking to negotiate a contract or agreement for the performance of such services shall file or shall have filed with the board of education a current statement of qualifications and supporting data. Such a statement may be filed at any time during a calendar year, and a $100 fee shall be remitted to the board of education by the professional firm at the time each statement is filed. No statement which shall have been filed more than two years prior to the publication of an advertisement pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be a current statement with respect to qualification of the firm which shall have filed the statement to provide professional architectural, engineering, or land surveying services under any contract or agreement of which notice is given through that advertisement. A statement of qualifications and supporting data filed with a board of education under this subsection shall be a public record for all purposes of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.). d.    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Public School Contracts Law, N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq.) to the contrary, a contract or agreement with an board of education for the procurement of professional architectural, engineering, or land surveying services shall be publicly advertised prior to the solicitation of proposals or expressions of interest from interested firms.  To the extent consistent with the purposes and provisions of this section, the advertisement shall conform to the requirements applicable to publicly bid contracts or may be publicly advertised through electronic means.  The advertisement shall include a statement of the criteria by which the board of education seeking to procure those professional services shall evaluate the technical qualifications of professional firms and determine the order of preference to be used in designating the firms most highly qualified to perform the services; this statement shall either set forth explicitly and in full the terms of those criteria or identify them by reference to the regulation or regulations in which those criteria shall have been promulgated as required by this section. In addition, the advertisement shall include notice that professional firms wishing to be considered for selection as a potential provider of such services in connection with a proposed project must have submitted to the board of education a current statement of qualifications and supporting data as prescribed in this section. e.     In the procurement of architectural, engineering and land surveying services, no board of education shall make, negotiate, or award a contract or agreement for the performance of such services with or to any professional firm which has not filed with the board of education a current statement of qualifications and supporting data as prescribed by this section. f.     For each proposed project, a board of education shall evaluate current statements of qualifications and supporting data on file with the board of education.  The board of education may solicit proposals or expressions of interest unique to the specific project which would in narrative form outline design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment.  The board of education shall select, in order of preference, based upon the criteria included in the advertisement required by this section, at least three professional firms deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required, except that the board of education may select fewer professional firms if fewer such firms responded to the solicitation or meet the qualifications required for the project. g.    A board of education which intends or expects to make, negotiate or award a contract or agreement for the procurement of professional architectural, engineering, or land surveying services shall, before publishing an advertisement of notice with respect to any such contract or agreement, have adopted the criteria by which it shall with respect to any such contract or agreement make the selection of qualified firms as prescribed by this section. h.    Once the top three or more ranked firms have been identified, each firm, at the request of the board of education, shall submit a fee proposal.  The firms shall not be told of their ranking position at that time.  Using the three fee proposals to provide a general guideline, a board of education shall negotiate a contract with the most technically qualified professional firm for architectural, engineering or land surveying services at compensation which the board of education determines to be fair and reasonable to the board of education.  In making this determination, the board of education shall take into account the estimated value of the services to be rendered and the scope, complexity, and professional nature thereof.  Should the board of education be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the professional firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee the board of education determines to be fair and reasonable, negotiations with that professional firm shall be formally terminated.  The board of education shall then undertake negotiations with the second most qualified professional firm.  Failing accord with the second most qualified professional firm, the board of education shall formally terminate negotiations.  The board of education shall then undertake negotiations with the third most qualified professional firm.  Should the board of education be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected professional firms, it shall select additional professional firms in order of their competence and qualifications and it shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached. i.     Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, the provisions of this section shall only apply to contracts for architectural, engineering and land surveying services in excess of the bid threshold established by law. j.     Nothing in this section shall preclude a board of education from using procurement processes other than those prescribed herein if those processes have been approved by the federal government or other State statute or if an emergency has been declared by the chief executive officer of the board. k.    The Commissioner of Education shall adopt, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), such rules and regulations as be necessary to implement the provisions of this section. 9.    (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a State agency shall have discretion to continue a professional services contract for legal services beyond its date of expiration without following a competitive contracting process to enter into a new contract when the expertise of that particular provider of legal services is essential for the completion of pending litigation, the completion of any construction contract, or the need to properly complete other legal services, and any potential change in the provider would be detrimental to the public interest. 10.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a unit of local government shall have discretion to continue a professional services contract for legal services beyond its date of expiration without following a competitive contracting process to enter into a new contract when the expertise of that particular provider of legal services is essential for the completion of pending litigation, the completion of any construction contract, or the need to properly complete other legal services, and any potential change in the provider would be detrimental to the public interest. 11.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a board of education shall have discretion to continue a professional services contract for legal services beyond its date of expiration without following a competitive contracting process to enter into a new contract when the expertise of that particular provider of legal services is essential for the completion of pending litigation, the completion of any construction contract, or the need to properly complete other legal services, and any potential change in the provider would be detrimental to the public interest. 12.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Under existing law, contracts for professional and technical services to be awarded by State agencies, including independent authorities, or by counties, municipalities, and school districts may be negotiated and awarded without being publicly advertising for bids.  This bill would provide, instead, that these contracts would be subject to a competitive bidding process. Contracts for architectural, engineering, and land surveying services of local governments and school boards will be awarded pursuant to a competitive contracting process on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications that is similar to the process for awarding of such contracts by State agencies. The bill allows the continuation of a professional services contract for legal services beyond the contracts expiration date when the expertise of that particular provider of legal services is essential for the completion of pending litigation, any construction contract, or other legal services, and any potential change in the provider would be detrimental to the public interest. The bill also provides that school board contracts for school photographs or portraits, like similar items that are paid with funds raised by or collected from students such as yearbooks and class rings, will not be required to be publicly advertised for bids.

Such a statement may be filed at any time during a calendar year, and a $100 fee shall be remitted to the contracting unit by the professional firm at the time each statement is filed.

surveying services, no board of education shall make, negotiate, or award a contract or agreement for the performance of such services with or to any professional firm which has not filed with the board of education a current statement of qualifications and supporting data as prescribed by this section. f.     For each proposed project, a board of education shall evaluate current statements of qualifications and supporting data on file with the board of education.  The board of education may solicit proposals or expressions of interest unique to the specific project which would in narrative form outline design concepts and proposed methods of approach to the assignment.  The board of education shall select, in order of preference, based upon the criteria included in the advertisement required by this section, at least three professional firms deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required, except that the board of education may select fewer professional firms if fewer such firms responded to the solicitation or meet the qualifications required for the project. g.    A board of education which intends or expects to make, negotiate or award a contract or agreement for the procurement of professional architectural, engineering, or land surveying services shall, before publishing an advertisement of notice with respect to any such contract or agreement, have adopted the criteria by which it shall with respect to any such contract or agreement make the selection of qualified firms as prescribed by this section. h.    Once the top three or more ranked firms have been identified, each firm, at the request of the board of education, shall submit a fee proposal.  The firms shall not be told of their ranking position at that time.  Using the three fee proposals to provide a general guideline, a board of education shall negotiate a contract with the most technically qualified professional firm for architectural, engineering or land surveying services at compensation which the board of education determines to be fair and reasonable to the board of education.  In making this determination, the board of education shall take into account the estimated value of the services to be rendered and the scope, complexity, and professional nature thereof.  Should the board of education be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the professional firm considered to be the most qualified at a fee the board of education determines to be fair and reasonable, negotiations with that professional firm shall be formally terminated.  The board of education shall then undertake negotiations with the second most qualified professional firm.  Failing accord with the second most qualified professional firm, the board of education shall formally terminate negotiations.  The board of education shall then undertake negotiations with the third most qualified professional firm.  Should the board of education be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with any of the selected professional firms, it shall select additional professional firms in order of their competence and qualifications and it shall continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached. i.     Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, the provisions of this section shall only apply to contracts for architectural, engineering and land surveying services in excess of the bid threshold established by law. j.     Nothing in this section shall preclude a board of education from using procurement processes other than those prescribed herein if those processes have been approved by the federal government or other State statute or if an emergency has been declared by the chief executive officer of the board. k.    The Commissioner of Education shall adopt, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), such rules and regulations as be necessary to implement the provisions of this section. 9.    (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a State agency shall have discretion to continue a professional services contract for legal services beyond its date of expiration without following a competitive contracting process to enter into a new contract when the expertise of that particular provider of legal services is essential for the completion of pending litigation, the completion of any construction contract, or the need to properly complete other legal services, and any potential change in the provider would be detrimental to the public interest. 10.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a unit of local government shall have discretion to continue a professional services contract for legal services beyond its date of expiration without following a competitive contracting process to enter into a new contract when the expertise of that particular provider of legal services is essential for the completion of pending litigation, the completion of any construction contract, or the need to properly complete other legal services, and any potential change in the provider would be detrimental to the public interest. 11.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a board of education shall have discretion to continue a professional services contract for legal services beyond its date of expiration without following a competitive contracting process to enter into a new contract when the expertise of that particular provider of legal services is essential for the completion of pending litigation, the completion of any construction contract, or the need to properly complete other legal services, and any potential change in the provider would be detrimental to the public interest. 12.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Under existing law, contracts for professional and technical services to be awarded by State agencies, including independent authorities, or by counties, municipalities, and school districts may be negotiated and awarded without being publicly advertising for bids.  This bill would provide, instead, that these contracts would be subject to a competitive bidding process. Contracts for architectural, engineering, and land surveying services of local governments and school boards will be awarded pursuant to a competitive contracting process on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications that is similar to the process for awarding of such contracts by State agencies. The bill allows the continuation of a professional services contract for legal services beyond the contracts expiration date when the expertise of that particular provider of legal services is essential for the completion of pending litigation, any construction contract, or other legal services, and any potential change in the provider would be detrimental to the public interest. The bill also provides that school board contracts for school photographs or portraits, like similar items that are paid with funds raised by or collected from students such as yearbooks and class rings, will not be required to be publicly advertised for bids.
