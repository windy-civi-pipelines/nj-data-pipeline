<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  a.  Any
contract for services to be performed by a contractor personally which are of a
technical and professional nature, other than a contract for architectural,
engineering and land surveying services awarded pursuant to P.L.1997, c.399 <br>
(C.52:34-9.1 et seq.), that is to be awarded by a State agency shall be

shall be negotiated on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications
for the type of technical and professional service required and at fair and
reasonable compensation and awarded pursuant to a competitive contracting
process in the manner provided by this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A professional firm that
wishes to be qualified to provide technical and professional services to a
State agency seeking to negotiate a contract or agreement for the performance
of those services shall file with the agency a current statement of
qualifications and supporting data. The statement may be filed at any time
during a calendar year, and a $100 fee shall be remitted to the State Treasurer
each time a statement is filed. The content of any such statement shall conform
to such regulations with respect thereto as the State Treasurer, in accordance
with the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c. 410 (C.52:14B-1
et seq.), shall promulgate.  No statement that shall have been filed more than
two years prior to the publication of an advertisement pursuant to this section
shall be deemed to be a current statement with respect to qualifications of the
firm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Notwithstanding the
provisions of any other law to the contrary, a contract or agreement with an
agency for the procurement of technical and professional services shall be
publicly advertised prior to the solicitation of proposals or expressions of
interest from interested firms.  To the extent consistent with the purposes and
provisions of this section, the advertisement shall conform to the requirements
applicable under subsections (a) and (b) of section 7 of P.L.1954, c.48
(C.52:34-12) or may be publicly advertised through electronic means.  The
advertisement shall include a statement of the criteria by which the agency
seeking to procure those services shall evaluate the qualifications of
professional firms and determine the order of preference to be used in
designating the firms most highly qualified to perform the services.  In
addition, the advertisement shall include notice that professional firms
wishing to be considered for selection as a potential provider of such services
in connection with a proposed project must have submitted to the agency a
current statement of qualifications and supporting data as provided in this
section.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    For each proposed
contract, an agency shall evaluate current statements of qualifications and
supporting data on file with the agency.  The agency may solicit proposals or
expressions of interest unique to the specific contract that would in narrative
form outline concepts and methods of approach to the contract.  The agency
shall select, in order of preference, based upon the criteria included in the
advertisement required by this section, at least three professional firms
deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required, except
that the agency may select fewer professional firms if fewer such firms
responded to the solicitation or meet the qualifications required for the
project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     An agency which intends
or expects to make, negotiate or award a contract or agreement for the
procurement of technical and professional services shall, before publishing an
advertisement of notice with respect  to any such contract or agreement, have
adopted by regulation and have promulgated, in accordance with the
&quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.),
the criteria by which it shall make, with respect to any such contract or
agreement, the selection of qualified firms as prescribed by this section.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Once the top three or
more ranked firms have been identified, each firm, at the request of the
agency, shall submit a fee proposal.  The firms shall not be told of their
ranking position at that time.  Using the three fee proposals to provide a
general guideline, an agency shall negotiate a contract with the most qualified
professional firm at compensation which the agency determines to be fair and
reasonable to the State of New Jersey.  In making this determination, the
agency shall take into account the estimated value of the services to be
rendered and the scope, complexity, and professional nature thereof.  Should
the agency be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the professional

for professional and technical services to be awarded by State agencies,
including independent authorities, or by counties, municipalities, and school
districts may be negotiated and awarded without being publicly advertising for
bids.  This bill would provide, instead, that these contracts would be subject
to a competitive bidding process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Contracts for architectural,
engineering, and land surveying services of local governments and school boards
will be awarded pursuant to a competitive contracting process on the basis of
demonstrated competence and qualifications that is similar to the process for
awarding of such contracts by State agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows the
continuation of a professional services contract for legal services beyond the
contracts expiration date when the expertise of that particular provider of
legal services is essential for the completion of pending litigation, any
construction contract, or other legal services, and any potential change in the
provider would be detrimental to the public interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that school
board contracts for school photographs or portraits, like similar items that
are paid with funds raised by or collected from students such as yearbooks and
class rings, will not be required to be publicly advertised for bids.</p>
