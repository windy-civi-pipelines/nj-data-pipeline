paragraph 2, to read as follows:</p>

is inherent in the people.  Government is instituted for the protection,
security, and benefit of the people, and they have the right at all times to
alter or reform the same, whenever the public good may require it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The people reserve unto
themselves the power to recall, after at least one year of service, any elected
official in this State or representing this State in the United States
Congress. The Legislature shall enact laws to provide for such recall
elections. Any such laws shall include a provision that a recall election shall
be held upon petition of at least 25% of the registered voters in the electoral
district of the official sought to be recalled.  If legislation to implement
this constitutional amendment is not enacted within one year of the adoption of
the amendment, the Secretary of State shall, by regulation, implement the
constitutional amendment, except that regulations adopted by the Secretary of
State shall be superseded by any subsequent legislation consistent with this
constitutional amendment governing recall elections. The sufficiency of any
statement of reasons or grounds procedurally required shall be a political rather
than a judicial question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>c.     The people reserve
unto themselves the power of initiative and referendum to direct the fiscal
policy and decisions of the State by enacting and repealing laws governing
certain forms of State spending, appropriations, and taxation as well as the
issuance of long-term public debt by approving the same at the polls in a
general election.</u></p>
