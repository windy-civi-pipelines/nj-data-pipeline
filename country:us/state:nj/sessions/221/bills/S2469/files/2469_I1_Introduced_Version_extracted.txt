P.L.2023, c.265 also requires the Commissioner of Community Affairs to adopt rules and regulations incorporating International Residential Code guidance pertaining to such installations by June 1, 2024, the first day of the fifth month following the date of that statutes enactment.  The bill would modify this requirement to allow the commissioner until the first day of the 13th month following the enactment of this bill, instead of the enactment of P.L.2023, c.265, to adopt these rules and regulations.
