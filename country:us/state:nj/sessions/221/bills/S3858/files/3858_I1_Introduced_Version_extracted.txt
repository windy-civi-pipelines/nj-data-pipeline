The bill also requires a school bus that transports one or more students with disabilities to be equipped with: 1) a video camera on the interior of the school bus to monitor student safety while the students are being transported; 2) a global positioning system that provides information about the location and speed of each school bus in real time; and 3) two-way communications equipment, which may include, but not be limited to, a cellular or other wireless telephone.  Under the bill, any video footage collected from a video camera and any data collected from a global positioning system is to be retained for not less than 180 days from the date it was recorded. Finally, the bill requires that each in-terminal school bus inspection conducted by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission is to provide for the inspection of the equipment required to be installed on school buses pursuant to the bill.

A board of education, or a school bus contractor as applicable, is required to ensure that certain training related to school bus safety and interacting with students with disabilities are provided to each school bus personnel member who works on a school bus transporting students with disabilities.  Pursuant to current law, these training programs are required to be administered to school bus drivers and school bus aides.  The bill expands these programs to cover all other school bus personnel members who work, and are responsible for the safety of students, on a school bus transporting one or more students with disabilities.  A board of education or school bus contractor that does not properly administer these training programs is to be subject to applicable penalties established under current law.

The bill also requires a school bus that transports one or more students with disabilities to be equipped with: 1) a video camera on the interior of the school bus to monitor student safety while the students are being transported; 2) a global positioning system that provides information about the location and speed of each school bus in real time; and 3) two-way communications equipment, which may include, but not be limited to, a cellular or other wireless telephone.  Under the bill, any video footage collected from a video camera and any data collected from a global positioning system is to be retained for not less than 180 days from the date it was recorded. Finally, the bill requires that each in-terminal school bus inspection conducted by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission is to provide for the inspection of the equipment required to be installed on school buses pursuant to the bill.
