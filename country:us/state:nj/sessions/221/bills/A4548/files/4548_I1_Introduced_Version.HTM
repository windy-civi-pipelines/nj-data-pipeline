gross income tax for employing persons with disabilities, and supplementing
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) and Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A taxpayer shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945,
c.162 (C.54:10A-5) in an amount equal to 15 percent of the wages paid by the
taxpayer during a privilege period to a qualified employee with a disability. 
The credit provided pursuant to this section during a privilege period shall
not exceed $2,000 per qualified employee with a disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  To claim the credit
provided pursuant to this section, a taxpayer shall submit an application to
the director for certification that one or more employees meet the criteria of
a qualified employee with a disability for purposes of qualifying for the
credit.  The director shall establish an application process and prescribe the
form and manner through which a taxpayer may submit an application for a
certification.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The director shall
review each application for certification submitted by a taxpayer in accordance
with this section and make a determination regarding the approval of an
application for certification within 90 calendar days of the date a complete
application is received.  The director shall issue a written certification to each
taxpayer whose application has been reviewed and approved by the director in
accordance with this section within five calendar days of the date the
directors determination is made.  A copy of the certification shall be
included in the filing of a return that includes a claim for the credit.  The
contents of the certification shall state the fact of the certification and not
disclose any private or confidential health information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If the director fails to
make a determination regarding an application submitted pursuant to this
subsection within 90 calendar days of the date the application is received, or
if the director fails to issue a written certification within five calendar days
of the date a determination is made, the application shall be deemed to have
been approved and the written certification shall be deemed to have been issued
by the director.  Each taxpayer that submitted an application in accordance
with this subsection but fails to receive a determination from the director
within 90 calendar days of the date the application is submitted, or fails to
receive a written certification from the director within five calendar days of
the date of the directors determination is made, shall include a copy of the
taxpayers application when filing a return that includes a claim for the
credit allowed in accordance with subsection a. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  All information regarding
a qualified employee with a disability which is obtained or compiled in
connection with the certification and which may be identified with the
qualified employee with a disability shall not be released to a person other
than the qualified employee with a disability, except as provided by subsection
d. of this section, unless the qualified employee with a disability provides
written permission to the division for the release of the information, provided
however that the division may release program statistics so classified as to
prevent the identification of a particular qualified employee with a disability
or that persons disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d. The director may confirm to
the employer of a qualified employee with a disability, upon application of the
employer, the fact that a qualified employee with a disability has been so
certified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The order of priority
of the application of the credit allowed under this section and any other
credits allowed by law shall be as prescribed by the Director of the Division
of Taxation.  The amount of credits applied under this section against the tax
imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege
period, together with any other payments, credits, deductions, and adjustments
allowed by law, shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax liability otherwise due
and shall not reduce the tax liability for a privilege period to an amount less
than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945,
c.162.  The amount of the credit otherwise allowable under this section which
cannot be applied for the privilege period due to the limitations of this
subsection or under other provisions of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.)
may be carried forward, if necessary, to the seven privilege periods following
the privilege period for which the credit is allowed.</p>

application is received.  The director shall issue a written certification to
each taxpayer whose application has been reviewed and approved by the director
in accordance with this section within five calendar days of the date the
directors determination is made.  A copy of the certification shall be
included in the filing of a return that includes a claim for the credit.  The

have been approved and the written certification shall be deemed to have been
issued by the director.  Each taxpayer that submitted an application in

received, or fails to receive a written certification from the director within
five calendar days of the date of the directors determination is made, shall

in connection with the certification and which may be identified with the
qualified employee with a disability shall not be released to a person other
than the qualified employee with a disability, except as provided by subsection
d. of this section, unless the qualified employee with a disability provides
written permission to the division for the release of the information, provided
however that the division may release program statistics so classified as to
prevent the identification of a particular qualified employee with a disability
or that persons disability.</p>

the employer of a qualified employee with a disability, upon application of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     (1)  A business entity
that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes shall not
be allowed the credit directly under the gross income tax, but the amount of
credit of the taxpayer in respect of a distributive share of partnership income

acquired by the partnership that is equal to the taxpayer's share, whether or
not distributed, of the total distributive income or gain of the partnership
for its taxable year ending within or with the taxpayer's taxable year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The order of priority

forward, if necessary, to the seven taxable years following the taxable year
for which the credit is allowed.</p>
