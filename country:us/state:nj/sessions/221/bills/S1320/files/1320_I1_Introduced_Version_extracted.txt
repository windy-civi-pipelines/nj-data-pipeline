The bill does not require a particular form of statement for the descriptions of services rendered or of the right to cancel, but does provide sample statements.  The bill requires a notice of right to cancel be part of the contract between the insured and the public adjuster. Lastly, the bill amends current law providing that no individual, firm, association, or corporation licensed under the Public Adjusters Licensing Act is permitted to receive, accept or hold any moneys toward the settlement of a claim for loss or damage on behalf of an insured unless the public adjuster deposits the moneys in a permitted escrow account to remove language stipulating that the escrow account be interest bearing.
