<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill concerns the
penalties for possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage
persons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, any person
under the legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages or cannabis items who
possesses or consumes alcoholic beverages or cannabis items, marijuana, or
hashish in any school, public conveyance, public place, place of public assembly,
or motor vehicle is subject to certain consequences, including a written
warning by a law enforcement officer to the underage person and if the person
is under 18 years of age, a written notification to the persons parent,
guardian, or other person having legal custody of the underage person.  For
certain violations, the law enforcement officer is also to provide
informational materials about how to access community services that will assist
the person with opportunities to access further social services.  Finally,
current law provides that the officer is also to take possession of any
alcoholic beverage, marijuana, hashish, or cannabis item and any drug or
cannabis paraphernalia. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill reinstates the
penalties for possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage
persons that were in place prior to the enactment of P.L.2021, c.25 and
P.L.2021, c.38 . Under this bill, any person under the legal age to purchase
alcoholic beverages who possesses or consumes any alcoholic beverage in any school,
public conveyance, public place, place of public assembly, or motor vehicle is
guilty of a disorderly persons offense and is to be fined not less than $500. 
In addition, when the offense is committed in a motor vehicle, the court is
required to suspend or postpone the driving privileges of the defendant for six
months. The court may also require the defendant to participate in an alcohol
education or treatment program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, current law prohibits
certain actions by law enforcement officers with respect to violations for the
consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages and marijuana, hashish, or
cannabis item by underage persons, including: 1)  providing that a person under
the legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages or cannabis items is not capable
of giving lawful consent to a search to determine a violation of current law
and prohibiting an officer from requesting that a person consent to such a
search; 2) providing that the odor of an alcoholic beverage, marijuana,
hashish, or cannabis, or burnt marijuana, hashish, cannabis or cannabis item
does not constitute reasonable articulable suspicion to initiate an
investigatory stop of a person or probable cause to initiate a search of a
person or the persons property to determine a violation of current law and
that the unconcealed possession of these items observed in plain sight by an
officer does not constitute probable cause to initiate a search of the person
or the persons property to determine a further violation of law; 3) providing
that an underage person who possesses or consumes alcoholic beverages,
marijuana, hashish, or a cannabis item in violation of current law is not to be
subject to arrest, transported to a police station, police headquarters, or
other place of law enforcement operations and shall not be subject to detention
or taken into custody, with certain limited exceptions; 4) prohibiting a law
enforcement officer from deactivating a body worn camera at the request of the
person who is the subject of a responsive call for service or law enforcement
or investigative encounter related to a violation for underage possession or
consumption of an alcoholic beverage, cannabis items, marijuana, or hashish;
and 5) providing that an underage person who violates current law regarding the
possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages, cannabis items, marijuana, or
hashish is not to be photographed or fingerprinted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, the
prohibitions set forth above would not apply to actions taken by law
enforcement with respect to the consumption or possession of alcoholic
beverages by underage persons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, current law
provides that a law enforcement officer is guilty of the crime of official
deprivation of civil rights for violating any provisions of current law that
address law enforcement actions involving persons who are under the legal age
to purchase alcoholic beverages or cannabis items.  Under this bill, law
enforcement actions involving persons who are under the legal age to purchase
alcoholic beverages would not be included in this provision. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, under current law,
the Attorney General is to biannually issue a report detailing the number of
occurrences and other statistics concerning first, second, third, and
subsequent violations involving the possession or consumption of alcoholic
beverages, marijuana, hashish, or cannabis items by underage persons, the
municipal, county, or other geographic areas within which first, second, third,
and subsequent violations occur, and the law enforcement agencies involved in
first, second, third, and subsequent violation, covering the previous six month
period.  This bill removes the requirement for the report to contain this
information regarding the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by
underage persons as these persons would no longer be issued first, second,
third and subsequent violations under the bill. </p>
