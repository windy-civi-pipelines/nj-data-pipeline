If the reason for the leave is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to give notice of the intention as soon as practicable, if the employer has notified the employee of this requirement.  Employers may prohibit employees from using foreseeable earned sick leave on certain dates, and require reasonable documentation if sick leave that is not foreseeable is used during those dates.  For earned sick leave of three or more consecutive days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the leave is being taken for the purpose permitted under subsection a. of this section. If the leave is permitted under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection a. of this section, documentation signed by a health care professional who is treating the employee or the family member of the employee indicating the need for the leave and, if possible, number of days of leave, shall be considered reasonable documentation.  If the leave is permitted under paragraph (3) of subsection a. of this section because of domestic or sexual violence, any of the following shall be considered reasonable documentation of the domestic or sexual violence: medical documentation; a law enforcement agency record or report; a court order; documentation that the perpetrator of the domestic or sexual violence has been convicted of a domestic or sexual violence offense; certification from a certified Domestic Violence Specialist or a representative of a designated domestic violence agency or other victim services organization; or other documentation or certification provided by a social worker, counselor, member of the clergy, shelter worker, health care professional, attorney, or other professional who has assisted the employee or family member in dealing with the domestic or sexual violence.  If the leave is permitted under paragraph (4) of subsection a. of this section, a copy of the order of the public official or the determination by the health authority shall be considered reasonable documentation. c.     Nothing in this act shall be deemed to require an employer to provide earned sick leave for an employee's leave for purposes other than those identified in this section, or prohibit the employer from taking disciplinary action against an employee who uses earned sick leave for purposes other than those identified in this section. An employer may provide an offer to an employee for a payment of unused earned sick leave in the final month of the employer's benefit year. The employee shall choose, no later than 10 calendar days from the date of the employer's offer, whether to accept a payment or decline a payment.  If the employee agrees to receive a payment, the employee shall choose a payment for the full amount of unused earned sick leave or for 50 percent of the amount of unused earned sick leave. The payment amount shall be based on the same rate of pay that the employee earns at the time of the payment.  If the employee declines a payment for unused earned sick leave, or agrees to a payment for 50 percent of the amount of unused sick leave, the employee shall be entitled to carry forward any unused or unpaid earned sick leave to the proceeding benefit year as provided pursuant to subsection a. of section 2 of this act.  If the employee agrees to a payment for the full amount of unused earned sick leave, the employee shall not be entitled to carry forward any earned sick leave to the proceeding benefit year pursuant to subsection a. of section 2 of this act. d.    If an employer foregoes the accrual process for earned sick leave hours pursuant to subsection a. of section 2 of this act and provides an employee with the full complement of earned sick leave for a benefit year on the first day of each benefit year, then the employer shall either provide to the employee a payment for the full amount of unused earned sick leave in the final month of the employer's benefit year or carry forward any unused sick leave to the next benefit year.  The employer may pay the employee the full amount of unused earned sick leave in the final month of a benefit year pursuant to this subsection only if the employer forgoes, with respect to that employee, the accrual process for earned sick leave during the next benefit year.  Unless an employer policy or collective bargaining agreement provides for the payment of accrued earned sick leave upon termination, resignation, retirement or other separation from employment, an employee shall not be entitled under this section to payment of unused earned sick leave upon the separation from employment. e.     Any information an employer possesses regarding the health of an employee or any family member of the employee or domestic or sexual violence affecting an employee or employee's family member shall be treated as confidential and not disclosed except to the affected employee or with the written permission of the affected employee. f.     An employee who is eligible for both earned sick leave pursuant to P.L.2018, c.10 (C.34:11D-1 et seq.). and either temporary disability benefits pursuant to P.L.1948, c. 110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), or family temporary disability leave benefits pursuant to P.L.2008, c. 17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) shall have the option of using either the earned sick leave or whichever is applicable of temporary disability benefits or family temporary disability leave benefits, or both earned sick leave and disability or family leave benefits, and may select the order in which the different kinds of leave are taken, but shall not receive more than one kind of leave simultaneously, and shall not be entitled to a total of more than three days of leave for any one instance of the events indicated in paragraph (9) of subsection a. of this section. (cf: P.L.2020, c.17, s.1) 3.    Section 2 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-26) is amended to read as follows: 2.    This act shall be liberally construed as remedial legislation enacted upon the following declarations of public policy and legislative findings of fact: The public policy of this State, already established, is to protect employees against the suffering and hardship generally caused by involuntary unemployment.  But the "unemployment compensation law" provides benefit payments to replace wage loss caused by involuntary unemployment only so long as an individual is "able to work, and is available for work," and fails to provide any protection against wage loss suffered because of inability to perform the duties of a job interrupted by non-occupational illness, injury, or other disability of the individual or of members of the individual's family.  Nor is there any other comprehensive and systematic provision for the protection of working people against loss of earnings due to a non-occupational sickness, accident, or other disability. The prevalence and incidence of non-occupational sickness, accident, and other disability among employed people is greatest among the lower income groups, who either cannot or will not voluntarily provide out of their own resources against the hazard of an earnings loss caused by non-occupational sickness, accident, or other disability.  Disabling sickness or accident occurs throughout the working population at one time or another, and approximately fifteen per centum (15%) of the number of people at work may be expected to suffer disabling illness of more than one week each year. It was found, prior to the enactment of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), that then existing voluntary plans for the payment of cash sickness benefits covered less than one-half of the number of working people of this State who were covered by the "unemployment compensation law," and that even that degree of voluntary protection afforded uneven, unequal and sometimes uncertain protection among the various voluntary benefit programs. While the enactment of that law has provided stable protection for New Jersey's disabled workers, very few workers are protected from income losses caused by the need to take time off from work to care for family members who are incapable of self-care, including newborn and newly-adopted children.  The growing portion of middle-income families in which all adult family members work, largely due to economic necessity, points to the desperate need for replacement income when a working family member must take time to care for family members who are unable to take care of themselves.  Moreover, the United States is the only industrialized nation in the world which does not have a mandatory workplace-based program for such income support.  It is therefore desirable and necessary to fill the gap in existing provisions for protection against the loss of earnings caused by involuntary unemployment, by extending such protection to meet the hazard of earnings loss due to inability to work caused by non-occupational sickness, accidents, or other disabilities of workers and members of their families. Developing systems that help families adapt to the competing interests of work and home not only benefits workers, but also benefits employers by reducing employee turnover and increasing worker productivity. The foregoing facts and considerations require that there be a uniform minimum program providing in a systematic manner for the payment of reasonable benefits to replace partially such earnings loss and to meet the continuing need for benefits where an individual becomes disabled during unemployment or needs to care for family members incapable of self-care.  In order to maintain consumer purchasing power, relieve the serious menace to health, morals and welfare of the people caused by insecurity and the loss of earnings, to reduce the necessity for public relief of needy persons, to increase workplace productivity and alleviate the enormous and growing stress on working families of balancing the demands of work and family needs, and in the interest of the health, welfare and security of the people of this State, such a system, enacted under the police power, is hereby established, requiring the payment of reasonable cash benefits to eligible individuals who are subject to accident or illness which is not compensable under the worker's compensation law or who need to care for family members incapable of self-care. [While the Legislature recognizes the pressing need for benefits for workers taking leave to care for family members incapable of self-care, it also finds that the need of workers for leave during their own disability continues to be especially acute, as a disabled worker has less discretion about taking time off from work than a worker caring for a family member.  Notwithstanding any interpretation of law which may be construed as providing a worker with rights to take action against an employer who fails or refuses to restore the worker to employment after the worker's own disability, the Legislature does not intend that the policy established by P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) of providing benefits for workers during periods of family temporary disability leave to care for family members incapable of self-care be construed as granting any worker an entitlement to be restored by the employer to employment held by the worker prior to taking family temporary disability leave or any right to take action, in tort, or for breach of an implied provision of the employment agreement, or under common law, against an employer who fails or refuses to restore the worker to employment after the family temporary disability leave, and the Legislature does not intend that the policy of providing benefits during family temporary disability leave be construed as increasing, reducing or otherwise modifying any entitlement of a worker to return to employment or right of the worker to take action under the provisions of the "Family Leave Act," P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.).] Since the enactment of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), the State government-operated State temporary disability benefits plan, or "State plan," has proven to be highly efficient and cost effective in providing temporary disability benefits to New Jersey workers.  The State plan guarantees the availability of coverage for all employers, regardless of experience, with low overhead costs and a rapid processing of claims and appeals by knowledgeable, impartial public employees. Consequently, the percentage of all employers using the State plan increased from 64% in 1952 to 98% in 2006, while the percentage of employees covered by the State plan increased from 28% to 83%. A publicly-operated, nonprofit State plan is therefore indispensable to achieving the goals of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.) (cf: P.L.2019, c.37, s.7) 4.    Section 3 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in this act, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a)   (1) "Covered employer" means, with respect to whether an employer is required to provide benefits during an employee's own disability pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), any individual or type of organization, including any partnership, association, trust, estate, joint-stock company, insurance company or corporation, whether domestic or foreign, or the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, trustee or successor thereof, or the legal representative of a deceased person, who is an employer subject to the "unemployment compensation law" (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), except the State, its political subdivisions, and any instrumentality of the State unless such governmental entity elects to become a covered employer pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (a); provided, however, that commencing with the effective date of this act, the State of New Jersey, including Rutgers, The State University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology, shall be deemed a covered employer, as defined herein. "Covered employer" means, after June 30, 2009, with respect to whether the employer is an employer whose employees are eligible for benefits during periods of family temporary disability leave pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), and, after December 31, 2008, whether employees of the employer are required to make contributions pursuant to R.S.43:21-7(d)(1)(G)(ii), any individual or type of organization, including any partnership, association, trust, estate, joint-stock company, insurance company or domestic or foreign corporation, or the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, trustee or successor thereof, or the legal representative of a deceased person, who is an employer subject to the "unemployment compensation law" (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), including any governmental entity or instrumentality which is an employer under R.S.43:21-19(h)(5), notwithstanding that the governmental entity or instrumentality has not elected to be a covered employer pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (a). (2)   Any governmental entity or instrumentality which is an employer under R.S.43:21-19(h)(5) may, with respect to the provision of benefits during an employee's own disability pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), elect to become a "covered employer" under this subsection beginning with the date on which its coverage under R.S.43:21-19(h)(5) begins or as of January 1 of any year thereafter by filing written notice of such election with the division within at least 30 days of the effective date.

(j) (1) "Average weekly wage" means, with respect to the payment of benefits commencing before the effective date of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2 et al.), the amount derived by dividing a covered individual's total wages earned from the individual's most recent covered employer during the base weeks in the eight calendar weeks immediately preceding the calendar week in which a period of disability commenced, by the number of such base weeks, and, with respect to the payment of benefits commencing on or after the effective date of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2 et al.), the amount derived by dividing a covered individual's total wages earned from the individual's most recent covered employer during the base weeks in the base year immediately preceding the calendar week in which a period of disability commenced, or in which the individual submits a claim for the benefits pursuant to subsection h. of section 10 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1) or paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of section 25 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-49), by the number of base weeks. (2)   With respect to the payment of benefits commencing before the effective date of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2 et al.), if the computation in paragraph (1) of this subsection (j) yields a result which is less than the individual's average weekly earnings in employment with all covered employers during the base weeks in such eight calendar weeks, then the average weekly wage shall be computed on the basis of earnings from all covered employers during the base weeks in the eight calendar weeks immediately preceding the week in which the period of disability commenced, and, with respect to the payment of benefits commencing on or after the effective date of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2 et al.), if the computation in paragraph (1) of this subsection (j) yields a result which is less than the individual's average weekly earnings in employment with all covered employers during the base weeks in the base year, then the average weekly wage shall be computed on the basis of earnings from all covered employers during the base weeks in the base year immediately preceding the week in which the period of disability commences, or in which the individual submits a claim for the benefits pursuant to subsection h. of section 10 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1) or paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of section 25 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-49). (3)   For periods of disability commencing on or after July 1, 2009 and before the effective date of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2 et al.), if the computations in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (j) both yield a result which is less than the individual's average weekly earnings in employment with all covered employers during the base weeks in the 26 calendar weeks immediately preceding the week in which the period of disability commenced, then the average weekly wage shall, upon a written request to the department by the individual on a form provided by the department, be computed by the department on the basis of earnings from all covered employers of the individual during the base weeks in those 26 calendar weeks, and, in the case of a claim for benefits from a private plan, that computation of the average weekly wage shall be provided by the department to the individual and the individual's employer. When determining the "average weekly wage" with respect to a period of family temporary disability leave for an individual who has a period of family temporary disability immediately after the individual has a period of disability for the individual's own disability, the period of disability is deemed to have commenced at the beginning of the period of disability for the individual's own disability, not the period of family temporary disability.

(cf: P.L.2019, c.37, s.21) 9.    Section 22 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-46) is amended to read as follows: 22.  State disability benefits fund. (a) The State disability benefits fund, hereinafter referred to as the fund, is hereby established. The fund shall remain in the custody of the State Treasurer, and to the extent of its cash requirements shall be deposited in authorized public depositories in the State of New Jersey.  There shall be deposited in and credited to the fund the amount of worker and employer contributions provided under subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of R.S.43:21-7 and subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-7, less refunds authorized by the chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.) to which this act is a supplement, and the entire amount of interest and earnings from investments of the fund, and all assessments, fines and penalties collected under this act. The fund shall be held in trust for the payment of disability benefits pursuant to this act, for the payment of benefits pursuant to subsection (f) of R.S.43:21-4, and for the payment of any authorized refunds of contributions.  All warrants for the payment of benefits shall be issued by and bear only the signature of the Director of the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance or his duly authorized agent for that purpose.  All other moneys withdrawn from the fund shall be upon warrant signed by the State Treasurer and countersigned by the Director of the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of the Department of Labor of the State of New Jersey. The Treasurer shall maintain books, records and accounts for the fund, appoint personnel and fix their compensation within the limits of available appropriations.  The expenses of the Treasurer in administering the fund and its accounts shall be charged against the administration account, as hereinafter established.  A separate account, to be known as the administration account, shall be maintained in the fund, and there shall be credited to such account an amount determined to be sufficient for proper administration, not to exceed, however, 1/10 of 1% of the wages with respect to which current contributions are payable into the fund pursuant to [paragraph (3), but not] paragraph (4)[,] of subsection [(a)] (b) of R.S.43:21-7, and the entire amount of any assessments against covered employers, as hereinafter provided, for costs of administration prorated among approved private plans.  The costs of administration of this act, including R.S.43:21-4(f), shall be charged to the administration account. (b)   A further separate account, to be known as the unemployment disability account, shall be maintained in the fund. Such account shall be charged with all benefit payments under R.S.43:21-4(f). Prior to July 1 of each calendar year, the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of the Department of Labor of the State of New Jersey shall determine the average rate of interest and other earnings on all investments of the State disability benefits fund for the preceding calendar year. An amount equal to the sum of the amounts withdrawn from the unemployment trust fund pursuant to section 23 hereof multiplied by such average rate shall be determined by the division and credited to the unemployment disability account as of the end of the preceding calendar year. If the unemployment disability account shall show an accumulated deficit in excess of $200,000.00 at the end of any calendar year after interest and other earnings have been credited as provided hereinabove, the division shall determine the ratio of such deficit to the total of all taxable wages paid during the preceding calendar year, and shall make an assessment against all employers in an amount equal to the taxable wages paid by them during such preceding calendar year to employees, multiplied by such ratio, but in no event shall any such assessment exceed 1/10 or 1% of such wages; provided, however, that the assessment made against the State (including Rutgers, The State University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology) shall not exceed the sum of all benefits paid under the provisions of R.S.43:21-4(f) as the result of employment with the State. Such amounts shall be collectible by the division in the same manner as provided for the collection of employee contributions under this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.). In making this assessment, the division shall furnish to each affected employer a brief summary of the determination thereof. The amount of such assessments collected by the division shall be credited to the unemployment disability account. As used in this section, "taxable wages" shall mean wages with respect to which employer contributions have been paid or are payable pursuant to subsections (a), (b) and (c) of R.S.43:21-7. (c)   A board of trustees, consisting of the State Treasurer, the Secretary of State, the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, the director of the division, and the State Comptroller, is hereby created. The board shall invest and reinvest all moneys in the fund in excess of its cash requirements, and such investments shall be made in obligations legal for savings banks; provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection shall in all respects be subject to the provisions of P.L.1950, c.270 (C.52:18A-79 et seq.). (d)   There is hereby appropriated, to be paid out of the fund, such amounts as may from time to time be required for the payment of disability benefits, and such amounts as may be required each year, as contained in the annual appropriation act, for the administration of this act, including R.S.43:21-4(f). (cf: P.L.2019, c.37, s.19) 10.  Section 24 of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-55.2) is amended to read as follows: 24.  a. An employer shall not discharge, harass, threaten, or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against an employee with respect to the compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment on the basis that the employee requested or took any temporary disability benefits pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), or family temporary disability leave benefits pursuant to P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.), including retaliation by refusing to [restore] reinstate to equivalent employment the employee following a period of leave[, except that, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-26), nothing in this section or any other section of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.) or P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) shall be construed as increasing, reducing or otherwise modifying any entitlement provided to a worker by the provisions of the "Family Leave Act," P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) to be restored to employment by the employer after a period of family temporary disability leave]. b.    Upon a violation of subsection a. of this section, as an alternative to any enforcement action that the employee is permitted to take pursuant to the provisions of the "Family Leave Act," P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.), an employee or former employee may institute a civil action in the Superior Court for relief.  All remedies available in common law tort actions shall be available to a prevailing plaintiff.  The court may also order any or all of the following relief: (1)   an assessment of a civil fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $2,000 for the first violation of any of the provisions of this section and not more than $5,000 for each subsequent violation; (2)   an injunction to restrain the continued violation of any of the provisions of this section; (3)   reinstatement of the employee to the same position or to a position equivalent to that which the employee held prior to unlawful discharge or retaliatory action, or other failure to reinstate the employee in violation of this section; (4)   reinstatement of full fringe benefits and seniority rights; (5)   compensation for any lost wages, benefits and other remuneration; and (6)   payment of reasonable costs and attorney's fees. c.     An employee who is eligible for both earned sick leave pursuant to P.L.2018, c.10 (C.34:11D-1 et seq.). and either temporary disability benefits pursuant to P.L.1948, c. 110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), or family temporary disability leave benefits pursuant to P.L.2008, c. 17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) shall have the option of using either the earned sick leave or whichever is applicable of temporary disability benefits or family temporary disability leave benefits, or both earned sick leave and disability or family leave benefits, and may select the order in which the different kinds of leave are taken, but shall not receive more than one kind of leave simultaneously. (cf: P.L.2019, c.37, s.24) 11.  This act shall take effect of the 90th day after enactment. STATEMENT This bill amends the States family leave, earned sick leave, temporary disability insurance, and family leave insurance laws to provide paid, protected, leave for each covered employees for: 1.    time needed by the employee for an intrauterine insemination or other assisted reproductive technology procedure, or related diagnosis, for the employee or the spouse, domestic partner or civil union partner, whether or not the procedure is successful; 2.    time needed to place a child with the employee by adoption or foster care, even if the placement is not finalized because it is contested by another party; 3.    time needed by the employee, in connection with a pregnancy loss, unsuccessful intrauterine insemination or other assisted reproductive technology procedure, a failed adoption or surrogacy arrangement, or other event impacting pregnancy or fertility, to receive any needed procedures, medications, mental health supports, or culturally responsive supports; 4.    time needed, up to three working days, for any instance of bereavement for the death of a family member, or for pregnancy loss; 5.    time needed to provide care for a spouse, domestic or civil union partner, or gestational carrier during pregnancy and recovery from childbirth, whether or not the childbirth is successful; or 6.    time needed for an employee to provide care for a spouse or domestic or civil union partner experiencing pregnancy loss, an unsuccessful assisted reproductive technology procedure, a failed adoption match or surrogacy arrangement, or other event impacting pregnancy or fertility; The bill permits an employee who is eligible for both earned sick leave and either temporary disability benefits or family leave benefits to have the options of using either the earned sick leave or whichever is applicable of temporary disability benefits or family leave benefits, or both earned sick leave and disability or family leave benefits, and of selecting the order in which the different kinds of leave are taken.  The bill eliminates the current seven-day waiting period for temporary disability benefits, to make those benefits more accessible to employees, including for the purposes to which benefits are extended under the bill.  It also facilitates greater access to use of the benefits by eliminating the provisions of the Family Leave Act which exclude employees of companies employing less than 30 employees from that laws provision of the right to be reinstated after leave. The bill also directs the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, in collaboration with the Department of Health, to: 1.    develop and disseminate to the public, directly or in collaboration with governmental or non-governmental entities, information regarding pregnancy loss, medically appropriate treatment options, and benefits made available pursuant to the bill; 2.    develop and disseminate to perinatal health care workers, current information regarding pregnancy loss and treatment, including both physical and mental health care; and 3.    expand and coordinate programs to research causes of, and treatment for, pregnancy loss, and collect and assess data regarding pregnancy loss, including demographic information. The bill provides that all costs of the publicity and studies are regarded as a cost of administration of temporary disability and family leave insurance and charged to the administration account of the State disability benefit fund, and modifies the formula for determining the maximum assessment for those costs by updating the wage data on which they are assessed to reflect recent changes in the determining benefit amounts under those programs.

If the leave is permitted under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection a. of this section, documentation signed by a health care professional who is treating the employee or the family member of the employee indicating the need for the leave and, if possible, number of days of leave, shall be considered reasonable documentation.  If the leave is permitted under paragraph (3) of subsection a. of this section because of domestic or sexual violence, any of the following shall be considered reasonable documentation of the domestic or sexual violence: medical documentation; a law enforcement agency record or report; a court order; documentation that the perpetrator of the domestic or sexual violence has been convicted of a domestic or sexual violence offense; certification from a certified Domestic Violence Specialist or a representative of a designated domestic violence agency or other victim services organization; or other documentation or certification provided by a social worker, counselor, member of the clergy, shelter worker, health care professional, attorney, or other professional who has assisted the employee or family member in dealing with the domestic or sexual violence.  If the leave is permitted under paragraph (4) of subsection a. of this section, a copy of the order of the public official or the determination by the health authority shall be considered reasonable documentation. c.     Nothing in this act shall be deemed to require an employer to provide earned sick leave for an employee's leave for purposes other than those identified in this section, or prohibit the employer from taking disciplinary action against an employee who uses earned sick leave for purposes other than those identified in this section. An employer may provide an offer to an employee for a payment of unused earned sick leave in the final month of the employer's benefit year. The employee shall choose, no later than 10 calendar days from the date of the employer's offer, whether to accept a payment or decline a payment.  If the employee agrees to receive a payment, the employee shall choose a payment for the full amount of unused earned sick leave or for 50 percent of the amount of unused earned sick leave. The payment amount shall be based on the same rate of pay that the employee earns at the time of the payment.  If the employee declines a payment for unused earned sick leave, or agrees to a payment for 50 percent of the amount of unused sick leave, the employee shall be entitled to carry forward any unused or unpaid earned sick leave to the proceeding benefit year as provided pursuant to subsection a. of section 2 of this act.  If the employee agrees to a payment for the full amount of unused earned sick leave, the employee shall not be entitled to carry forward any earned sick leave to the proceeding benefit year pursuant to subsection a. of section 2 of this act. d.    If an employer foregoes the accrual process for earned sick leave hours pursuant to subsection a. of section 2 of this act and provides an employee with the full complement of earned sick leave for a benefit year on the first day of each benefit year, then the employer shall either provide to the employee a payment for the full amount of unused earned sick leave in the final month of the employer's benefit year or carry forward any unused sick leave to the next benefit year.  The employer may pay the employee the full amount of unused earned sick leave in the final month of a benefit year pursuant to this subsection only if the employer forgoes, with respect to that employee, the accrual process for earned sick leave during the next benefit year.  Unless an employer policy or collective bargaining agreement provides for the payment of accrued earned sick leave upon termination, resignation, retirement or other separation from employment, an employee shall not be entitled under this section to payment of unused earned sick leave upon the separation from employment. e.     Any information an employer possesses regarding the health of an employee or any family member of the employee or domestic or sexual violence affecting an employee or employee's family member shall be treated as confidential and not disclosed except to the affected employee or with the written permission of the affected employee. f.     An employee who is eligible for both earned sick leave pursuant to P.L.2018, c.10 (C.34:11D-1 et seq.). and either temporary disability benefits pursuant to P.L.1948, c. 110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), or family temporary disability leave benefits pursuant to P.L.2008, c. 17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) shall have the option of using either the earned sick leave or whichever is applicable of temporary disability benefits or family temporary disability leave benefits, or both earned sick leave and disability or family leave benefits, and may select the order in which the different kinds of leave are taken, but shall not receive more than one kind of leave simultaneously, and shall not be entitled to a total of more than three days of leave for any one instance of the events indicated in paragraph (9) of subsection a. of this section. (cf: P.L.2020, c.17, s.1) 3.    Section 2 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-26) is amended to read as follows: 2.    This act shall be liberally construed as remedial legislation enacted upon the following declarations of public policy and legislative findings of fact: The public policy of this State, already established, is to protect employees against the suffering and hardship generally caused by involuntary unemployment.  But the "unemployment compensation law" provides benefit payments to replace wage loss caused by involuntary unemployment only so long as an individual is "able to work, and is available for work," and fails to provide any protection against wage loss suffered because of inability to perform the duties of a job interrupted by non-occupational illness, injury, or other disability of the individual or of members of the individual's family.  Nor is there any other comprehensive and systematic provision for the protection of working people against loss of earnings due to a non-occupational sickness, accident, or other disability. The prevalence and incidence of non-occupational sickness, accident, and other disability among employed people is greatest among the lower income groups, who either cannot or will not voluntarily provide out of their own resources against the hazard of an earnings loss caused by non-occupational sickness, accident, or other disability.  Disabling sickness or accident occurs throughout the working population at one time or another, and approximately fifteen per centum (15%) of the number of people at work may be expected to suffer disabling illness of more than one week each year. It was found, prior to the enactment of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), that then existing voluntary plans for the payment of cash sickness benefits covered less than one-half of the number of working people of this State who were covered by the "unemployment compensation law," and that even that degree of voluntary protection afforded uneven, unequal and sometimes uncertain protection among the various voluntary benefit programs. While the enactment of that law has provided stable protection for New Jersey's disabled workers, very few workers are protected from income losses caused by the need to take time off from work to care for family members who are incapable of self-care, including newborn and newly-adopted children.  The growing portion of middle-income families in which all adult family members work, largely due to economic necessity, points to the desperate need for replacement income when a working family member must take time to care for family members who are unable to take care of themselves.  Moreover, the United States is the only industrialized nation in the world which does not have a mandatory workplace-based program for such income support.  It is therefore desirable and necessary to fill the gap in existing provisions for protection against the loss of earnings caused by involuntary unemployment, by extending such protection to meet the hazard of earnings loss due to inability to work caused by non-occupational sickness, accidents, or other disabilities of workers and members of their families. Developing systems that help families adapt to the competing interests of work and home not only benefits workers, but also benefits employers by reducing employee turnover and increasing worker productivity. The foregoing facts and considerations require that there be a uniform minimum program providing in a systematic manner for the payment of reasonable benefits to replace partially such earnings loss and to meet the continuing need for benefits where an individual becomes disabled during unemployment or needs to care for family members incapable of self-care.  In order to maintain consumer purchasing power, relieve the serious menace to health, morals and welfare of the people caused by insecurity and the loss of earnings, to reduce the necessity for public relief of needy persons, to increase workplace productivity and alleviate the enormous and growing stress on working families of balancing the demands of work and family needs, and in the interest of the health, welfare and security of the people of this State, such a system, enacted under the police power, is hereby established, requiring the payment of reasonable cash benefits to eligible individuals who are subject to accident or illness which is not compensable under the worker's compensation law or who need to care for family members incapable of self-care. [While the Legislature recognizes the pressing need for benefits for workers taking leave to care for family members incapable of self-care, it also finds that the need of workers for leave during their own disability continues to be especially acute, as a disabled worker has less discretion about taking time off from work than a worker caring for a family member.  Notwithstanding any interpretation of law which may be construed as providing a worker with rights to take action against an employer who fails or refuses to restore the worker to employment after the worker's own disability, the Legislature does not intend that the policy established by P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) of providing benefits for workers during periods of family temporary disability leave to care for family members incapable of self-care be construed as granting any worker an entitlement to be restored by the employer to employment held by the worker prior to taking family temporary disability leave or any right to take action, in tort, or for breach of an implied provision of the employment agreement, or under common law, against an employer who fails or refuses to restore the worker to employment after the family temporary disability leave, and the Legislature does not intend that the policy of providing benefits during family temporary disability leave be construed as increasing, reducing or otherwise modifying any entitlement of a worker to return to employment or right of the worker to take action under the provisions of the "Family Leave Act," P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.).] Since the enactment of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), the State government-operated State temporary disability benefits plan, or "State plan," has proven to be highly efficient and cost effective in providing temporary disability benefits to New Jersey workers.  The State plan guarantees the availability of coverage for all employers, regardless of experience, with low overhead costs and a rapid processing of claims and appeals by knowledgeable, impartial public employees. Consequently, the percentage of all employers using the State plan increased from 64% in 1952 to 98% in 2006, while the percentage of employees covered by the State plan increased from 28% to 83%. A publicly-operated, nonprofit State plan is therefore indispensable to achieving the goals of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.) (cf: P.L.2019, c.37, s.7) 4.    Section 3 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in this act, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a)   (1) "Covered employer" means, with respect to whether an employer is required to provide benefits during an employee's own disability pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), any individual or type of organization, including any partnership, association, trust, estate, joint-stock company, insurance company or corporation, whether domestic or foreign, or the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, trustee or successor thereof, or the legal representative of a deceased person, who is an employer subject to the "unemployment compensation law" (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), except the State, its political subdivisions, and any instrumentality of the State unless such governmental entity elects to become a covered employer pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (a); provided, however, that commencing with the effective date of this act, the State of New Jersey, including Rutgers, The State University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology, shall be deemed a covered employer, as defined herein. "Covered employer" means, after June 30, 2009, with respect to whether the employer is an employer whose employees are eligible for benefits during periods of family temporary disability leave pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), and, after December 31, 2008, whether employees of the employer are required to make contributions pursuant to R.S.43:21-7(d)(1)(G)(ii), any individual or type of organization, including any partnership, association, trust, estate, joint-stock company, insurance company or domestic or foreign corporation, or the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, trustee or successor thereof, or the legal representative of a deceased person, who is an employer subject to the "unemployment compensation law" (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), including any governmental entity or instrumentality which is an employer under R.S.43:21-19(h)(5), notwithstanding that the governmental entity or instrumentality has not elected to be a covered employer pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (a).

"Covered individual" shall not mean, with respect to whether an individual is eligible for benefits during an individual's own disability pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), any member of the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety. (2)   "Covered individual" means, with respect to whether an individual is eligible for benefits during the individual's period of family temporary disability leave pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), any individual who is in employment, as defined in the "unemployment compensation law" (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), for which the individual is entitled to remuneration from a covered employer, or who has been out of that employment for less than two weeks.

(5)   In the case of an individual who is laid off or furloughed by an employer curtailing operations because of a state of emergency declared after October 22, 2012, any week in which the individual is separated from employment due to that layoff or furlough, up to a maximum of 13 weeks, shall be regarded as a week which is a "base week" for the purpose of determining whether the individual becomes eligible for benefits pursuant to subsection (d) or (e) of section 17 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-41), but shall not be regarded as a base week when calculating the "average weekly wage" pursuant to subsection (j) of this section. (j) (1) "Average weekly wage" means, with respect to the payment of benefits commencing before the effective date of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2 et al.), the amount derived by dividing a covered individual's total wages earned from the individual's most recent covered employer during the base weeks in the eight calendar weeks immediately preceding the calendar week in which a period of disability commenced, by the number of such base weeks, and, with respect to the payment of benefits commencing on or after the effective date of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2 et al.), the amount derived by dividing a covered individual's total wages earned from the individual's most recent covered employer during the base weeks in the base year immediately preceding the calendar week in which a period of disability commenced, or in which the individual submits a claim for the benefits pursuant to subsection h. of section 10 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1) or paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of section 25 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-49), by the number of base weeks. (2)   With respect to the payment of benefits commencing before the effective date of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2 et al.), if the computation in paragraph (1) of this subsection (j) yields a result which is less than the individual's average weekly earnings in employment with all covered employers during the base weeks in such eight calendar weeks, then the average weekly wage shall be computed on the basis of earnings from all covered employers during the base weeks in the eight calendar weeks immediately preceding the week in which the period of disability commenced, and, with respect to the payment of benefits commencing on or after the effective date of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2 et al.), if the computation in paragraph (1) of this subsection (j) yields a result which is less than the individual's average weekly earnings in employment with all covered employers during the base weeks in the base year, then the average weekly wage shall be computed on the basis of earnings from all covered employers during the base weeks in the base year immediately preceding the week in which the period of disability commences, or in which the individual submits a claim for the benefits pursuant to subsection h. of section 10 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1) or paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of section 25 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-49). (3)   For periods of disability commencing on or after July 1, 2009 and before the effective date of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-45.2 et al.), if the computations in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (j) both yield a result which is less than the individual's average weekly earnings in employment with all covered employers during the base weeks in the 26 calendar weeks immediately preceding the week in which the period of disability commenced, then the average weekly wage shall, upon a written request to the department by the individual on a form provided by the department, be computed by the department on the basis of earnings from all covered employers of the individual during the base weeks in those 26 calendar weeks, and, in the case of a claim for benefits from a private plan, that computation of the average weekly wage shall be provided by the department to the individual and the individual's employer. When determining the "average weekly wage" with respect to a period of family temporary disability leave for an individual who has a period of family temporary disability immediately after the individual has a period of disability for the individual's own disability, the period of disability is deemed to have commenced at the beginning of the period of disability for the individual's own disability, not the period of family temporary disability. (k)   "Child" means a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild or legal ward of a covered individual, child of a domestic partner of the covered individual, or child of a civil union partner of the covered individual, including a child who becomes the child of a parent pursuant to a valid written agreement between the parent and a gestational carrier.

"Family temporary disability leave" does not include any period of time in which a covered individual is paid benefits pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.) because the individual is unable to perform the duties of the individual's employment due to the individual's own disability. (p)   "Health care provider" means a health care provider as defined in the "Family Leave Act," P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.), and any regulations adopted pursuant to that act.

The Treasurer shall maintain books, records and accounts for the fund, appoint personnel and fix their compensation within the limits of available appropriations.  The expenses of the Treasurer in administering the fund and its accounts shall be charged against the administration account, as hereinafter established.  A separate account, to be known as the administration account, shall be maintained in the fund, and there shall be credited to such account an amount determined to be sufficient for proper administration, not to exceed, however, 1/10 of 1% of the wages with respect to which current contributions are payable into the fund pursuant to [paragraph (3), but not] paragraph (4)[,] of subsection [(a)] (b) of R.S.43:21-7, and the entire amount of any assessments against covered employers, as hereinafter provided, for costs of administration prorated among approved private plans.  The costs of administration of this act, including R.S.43:21-4(f), shall be charged to the administration account. (b)   A further separate account, to be known as the unemployment disability account, shall be maintained in the fund. Such account shall be charged with all benefit payments under R.S.43:21-4(f). Prior to July 1 of each calendar year, the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of the Department of Labor of the State of New Jersey shall determine the average rate of interest and other earnings on all investments of the State disability benefits fund for the preceding calendar year. An amount equal to the sum of the amounts withdrawn from the unemployment trust fund pursuant to section 23 hereof multiplied by such average rate shall be determined by the division and credited to the unemployment disability account as of the end of the preceding calendar year. If the unemployment disability account shall show an accumulated deficit in excess of $200,000.00 at the end of any calendar year after interest and other earnings have been credited as provided hereinabove, the division shall determine the ratio of such deficit to the total of all taxable wages paid during the preceding calendar year, and shall make an assessment against all employers in an amount equal to the taxable wages paid by them during such preceding calendar year to employees, multiplied by such ratio, but in no event shall any such assessment exceed 1/10 or 1% of such wages; provided, however, that the assessment made against the State (including Rutgers, The State University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology) shall not exceed the sum of all benefits paid under the provisions of R.S.43:21-4(f) as the result of employment with the State. Such amounts shall be collectible by the division in the same manner as provided for the collection of employee contributions under this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.). In making this assessment, the division shall furnish to each affected employer a brief summary of the determination thereof. The amount of such assessments collected by the division shall be credited to the unemployment disability account. As used in this section, "taxable wages" shall mean wages with respect to which employer contributions have been paid or are payable pursuant to subsections (a), (b) and (c) of R.S.43:21-7. (c)   A board of trustees, consisting of the State Treasurer, the Secretary of State, the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, the director of the division, and the State Comptroller, is hereby created. The board shall invest and reinvest all moneys in the fund in excess of its cash requirements, and such investments shall be made in obligations legal for savings banks; provided, however, that the provisions of this subsection shall in all respects be subject to the provisions of P.L.1950, c.270 (C.52:18A-79 et seq.). (d)   There is hereby appropriated, to be paid out of the fund, such amounts as may from time to time be required for the payment of disability benefits, and such amounts as may be required each year, as contained in the annual appropriation act, for the administration of this act, including R.S.43:21-4(f). (cf: P.L.2019, c.37, s.19) 10.  Section 24 of P.L.2019, c.37 (C.43:21-55.2) is amended to read as follows: 24.  a. An employer shall not discharge, harass, threaten, or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against an employee with respect to the compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment on the basis that the employee requested or took any temporary disability benefits pursuant to P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), or family temporary disability leave benefits pursuant to P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.), including retaliation by refusing to [restore] reinstate to equivalent employment the employee following a period of leave[, except that, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-26), nothing in this section or any other section of P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.) or P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) shall be construed as increasing, reducing or otherwise modifying any entitlement provided to a worker by the provisions of the "Family Leave Act," P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.) to be restored to employment by the employer after a period of family temporary disability leave]. b.    Upon a violation of subsection a. of this section, as an alternative to any enforcement action that the employee is permitted to take pursuant to the provisions of the "Family Leave Act," P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.), an employee or former employee may institute a civil action in the Superior Court for relief.  All remedies available in common law tort actions shall be available to a prevailing plaintiff.  The court may also order any or all of the following relief: (1)   an assessment of a civil fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $2,000 for the first violation of any of the provisions of this section and not more than $5,000 for each subsequent violation; (2)   an injunction to restrain the continued violation of any of the provisions of this section; (3)   reinstatement of the employee to the same position or to a position equivalent to that which the employee held prior to unlawful discharge or retaliatory action, or other failure to reinstate the employee in violation of this section; (4)   reinstatement of full fringe benefits and seniority rights; (5)   compensation for any lost wages, benefits and other remuneration; and (6)   payment of reasonable costs and attorney's fees. c.     An employee who is eligible for both earned sick leave pursuant to P.L.2018, c.10 (C.34:11D-1 et seq.). and either temporary disability benefits pursuant to P.L.1948, c. 110 (C.43:21-25 et al.), or family temporary disability leave benefits pursuant to P.L.2008, c. 17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) shall have the option of using either the earned sick leave or whichever is applicable of temporary disability benefits or family temporary disability leave benefits, or both earned sick leave and disability or family leave benefits, and may select the order in which the different kinds of leave are taken, but shall not receive more than one kind of leave simultaneously. (cf: P.L.2019, c.37, s.24) 11.  This act shall take effect of the 90th day after enactment. STATEMENT This bill amends the States family leave, earned sick leave, temporary disability insurance, and family leave insurance laws to provide paid, protected, leave for each covered employees for: 1.    time needed by the employee for an intrauterine insemination or other assisted reproductive technology procedure, or related diagnosis, for the employee or the spouse, domestic partner or civil union partner, whether or not the procedure is successful; 2.    time needed to place a child with the employee by adoption or foster care, even if the placement is not finalized because it is contested by another party; 3.    time needed by the employee, in connection with a pregnancy loss, unsuccessful intrauterine insemination or other assisted reproductive technology procedure, a failed adoption or surrogacy arrangement, or other event impacting pregnancy or fertility, to receive any needed procedures, medications, mental health supports, or culturally responsive supports; 4.    time needed, up to three working days, for any instance of bereavement for the death of a family member, or for pregnancy loss; 5.    time needed to provide care for a spouse, domestic or civil union partner, or gestational carrier during pregnancy and recovery from childbirth, whether or not the childbirth is successful; or 6.    time needed for an employee to provide care for a spouse or domestic or civil union partner experiencing pregnancy loss, an unsuccessful assisted reproductive technology procedure, a failed adoption match or surrogacy arrangement, or other event impacting pregnancy or fertility; The bill permits an employee who is eligible for both earned sick leave and either temporary disability benefits or family leave benefits to have the options of using either the earned sick leave or whichever is applicable of temporary disability benefits or family leave benefits, or both earned sick leave and disability or family leave benefits, and of selecting the order in which the different kinds of leave are taken.  The bill eliminates the current seven-day waiting period for temporary disability benefits, to make those benefits more accessible to employees, including for the purposes to which benefits are extended under the bill.  It also facilitates greater access to use of the benefits by eliminating the provisions of the Family Leave Act which exclude employees of companies employing less than 30 employees from that laws provision of the right to be reinstated after leave. The bill also directs the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, in collaboration with the Department of Health, to: 1.    develop and disseminate to the public, directly or in collaboration with governmental or non-governmental entities, information regarding pregnancy loss, medically appropriate treatment options, and benefits made available pursuant to the bill; 2.    develop and disseminate to perinatal health care workers, current information regarding pregnancy loss and treatment, including both physical and mental health care; and 3.    expand and coordinate programs to research causes of, and treatment for, pregnancy loss, and collect and assess data regarding pregnancy loss, including demographic information. The bill provides that all costs of the publicity and studies are regarded as a cost of administration of temporary disability and family leave insurance and charged to the administration account of the State disability benefit fund, and modifies the formula for determining the maximum assessment for those costs by updating the wage data on which they are assessed to reflect recent changes in the determining benefit amounts under those programs.
