of this requirement.  Employers may prohibit employees from using foreseeable

year or carry forward any unused sick leave to the next benefit year.  The
employer may pay the employee the full amount of unused earned sick leave in
the final month of a benefit year pursuant to this subsection only if the employer
forgoes, with respect to that employee, the accrual process for earned sick

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Section 2 of P.L.1948,
c.110 (C.43:21-26) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    This act shall be
liberally construed as remedial legislation enacted upon the following
declarations of public policy and legislative findings of fact:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The public policy of this
State, already established, is to protect employees against the suffering and
hardship generally caused by involuntary unemployment.  But the &quot;unemployment
compensation law&quot; provides benefit payments to replace wage loss caused by
involuntary unemployment only so long as an individual is &quot;able to work,
and is available for work,&quot; and fails to provide any protection against
wage loss suffered because of inability to perform the duties of a job
interrupted by non-occupational illness, injury, or other disability of the
individual or of members of the individual's family.  Nor is there any other
comprehensive and systematic provision for the protection of working people
against loss of earnings due to a non-occupational sickness, accident, or other
disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The prevalence and incidence
of non-occupational sickness, accident, and other disability among employed
people is greatest among the lower income groups, who either cannot or will not
voluntarily provide out of their own resources against the hazard of an
earnings loss caused by non-occupational sickness, accident, or other
disability.  Disabling sickness or accident occurs throughout the working
population at one time or another, and approximately fifteen per centum (15%)
of the number of people at work may be expected to suffer disabling illness of
more than one week each year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It was found, prior to the
enactment of the &quot;Temporary Disability Benefits Law,&quot; P.L.1948, c.110
(C.43:21-25 et al.), that then existing voluntary plans for the payment of cash
sickness benefits covered less than one-half of the number of working people of
this State who were covered by the &quot;unemployment compensation law,&quot;
and that even that degree of voluntary protection afforded uneven, unequal and
sometimes uncertain protection among the various voluntary benefit programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     While the enactment of that
law has provided stable protection for New Jersey's disabled workers, very few
workers are protected from income losses caused by the need to take time off
from work to care for family members who are incapable of self-care, including
newborn and newly-adopted children.  The growing portion of middle-income
families in which all adult family members work, largely due to economic
necessity, points to the desperate need for replacement income when a working
family member must take time to care for family members who are unable to take
care of themselves.  Moreover, the United States is the only industrialized
nation in the world which does not have a mandatory workplace-based program for
such income support.  It is therefore desirable and necessary to fill the gap
in existing provisions for protection against the loss of earnings caused by
involuntary unemployment, by extending such protection to meet the hazard of
earnings loss due to inability to work caused by non-occupational sickness,
accidents, or other disabilities of workers and members of their families. 
Developing systems that help families adapt to the competing interests of work
and home not only benefits workers, but also benefits employers by reducing
employee turnover and increasing worker productivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The foregoing facts and
considerations require that there be a uniform minimum program providing in a
systematic manner for the payment of reasonable benefits to replace partially
such earnings loss and to meet the continuing need for benefits where an
individual becomes disabled during unemployment or needs to care for family
members incapable of self-care.  In order to maintain consumer purchasing
power, relieve the serious menace to health, morals and welfare of the people
caused by insecurity and the loss of earnings, to reduce the necessity for
public relief of needy persons, to increase workplace productivity and
alleviate the enormous and growing stress on working families of balancing the
demands of work and family needs, and in the interest of the health, welfare
and security of the people of this State, such a system, enacted under the
police power, is hereby established, requiring the payment of reasonable cash
benefits to eligible individuals who are subject to accident or illness which
is not compensable under the worker's compensation law or who need to care for
family members incapable of self-care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>While the Legislature recognizes
the pressing need for benefits for workers taking leave to care for family
members incapable of self-care, it also finds that the need of workers for
leave during their own disability continues to be especially acute, as a
disabled worker has less discretion about taking time off from work than a
worker caring for a family member.  Notwithstanding any interpretation of law
which may be construed as providing a worker with rights to take action against
an employer who fails or refuses to restore the worker to employment after the
worker's own disability, the Legislature does not intend that the policy
established by P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.1 et al.) of providing benefits for
workers during periods of family temporary disability leave to care for family
members incapable of self-care be construed as granting any worker an
entitlement to be restored by the employer to employment held by the worker
prior to taking family temporary disability leave or any right to take action,
in tort, or for breach of an implied provision of the employment agreement, or
under common law, against an employer who fails or refuses to restore the
worker to employment after the family temporary disability leave, and the
Legislature does not intend that the policy of providing benefits during family
temporary disability leave be construed as increasing, reducing or otherwise
modifying any entitlement of a worker to return to employment or right of the worker
to take action under the provisions of the &quot;Family Leave Act,&quot;
P.L.1989, c.261 (C.34:11B-1 et seq.).<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Since the enactment of the
&quot;Temporary Disability Benefits Law,&quot; P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et
al.), the State government-operated State temporary disability benefits plan,
or &quot;State plan,&quot; has proven to be highly efficient and cost effective
in providing temporary disability benefits to New Jersey workers.  The State
plan guarantees the availability of coverage for all employers, regardless of
experience, with low overhead costs and a rapid processing of claims and
appeals by knowledgeable, impartial public employees. Consequently, the
percentage of all employers using the State plan increased from 64% in 1952 to
98% in 2006, while the percentage of employees covered by the State plan
increased from 28% to 83%. A publicly-operated, nonprofit State plan is
therefore indispensable to achieving the goals of the &quot;Temporary
Disability Benefits Law,&quot; P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et al.)</p>

fund. (a) The State disability benefits fund, hereinafter referred to as the
fund, is hereby established. The fund shall remain in the custody of the State
Treasurer, and to the extent of its cash requirements shall be deposited in
authorized public depositories in the State of New Jersey.  There shall be
deposited in and credited to the fund the amount of worker and employer
contributions provided under subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d)
of R.S.43:21-7 and subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-7, less refunds authorized by
the chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.) to which this act is a supplement, and the
entire amount of interest and earnings from investments of the fund, and all
assessments, fines and penalties collected under this act. The fund shall be
held in trust for the payment of disability benefits pursuant to this act, for
the payment of benefits pursuant to subsection (f) of R.S.43:21-4, and for the
payment of any authorized refunds of contributions.  All warrants for the
payment of benefits shall be issued by and bear only the signature of the
Director of the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance or
his duly authorized agent for that purpose.  All other moneys withdrawn from
the fund shall be upon warrant signed by the State Treasurer and countersigned
by the Director of the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability
Insurance of the Department of Labor of the State of New Jersey. The Treasurer
shall maintain books, records and accounts for the fund, appoint personnel and
fix their compensation within the limits of available appropriations.  The
expenses of the Treasurer in administering the fund and its accounts shall be
charged against the administration account, as hereinafter established.  A
separate account, to be known as the administration account, shall be
maintained in the fund, and there shall be credited to such account an amount
determined to be sufficient for proper administration, not to exceed, however, 1/10
of 1% of the wages with respect to which current contributions are payable into
the fund pursuant to <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>paragraph

average rate of interest and other earnings on all investments of the State
disability benefits fund for the preceding calendar year. An amount equal to
the sum of the amounts withdrawn from the unemployment trust fund pursuant to
section 23 hereof multiplied by such average rate shall be determined by the
division and credited to the unemployment disability account as of the end of
the preceding calendar year. </p>

account shall show an accumulated deficit in excess of $200,000.00 at the end

provided hereinabove, the division shall determine the ratio of such deficit to
the total of all taxable wages paid during the preceding calendar year, and
shall make an assessment against all employers in an amount equal to the
taxable wages paid by them during such preceding calendar year to employees,
multiplied by such ratio, but in no event shall any such assessment exceed 1/10
or 1% of such wages; provided, however, that the assessment made against the
State (including Rutgers, The State University and the New Jersey Institute of
Technology) shall not exceed the sum of all benefits paid under the provisions
of R.S.43:21-4(f) as the result of employment with the State. Such amounts
shall be collectible by the division in the same manner as provided for the
collection of employee contributions under this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.).
In making this assessment, the division shall furnish to each affected employer
a brief summary of the determination thereof. The amount of such assessments
collected by the division shall be credited to the unemployment disability

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the States
family leave, earned sick leave, temporary disability insurance, and family
leave insurance laws to provide paid, protected, leave for each covered
employees for:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    time needed by the
employee for an intrauterine insemination or other assisted reproductive
technology procedure, or related diagnosis, for the employee or the spouse,
domestic partner or civil union partner, whether or not the procedure is
successful;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    time needed to place a
child with the employee by adoption or foster care, even if the placement is
not finalized because it is contested by another party;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    time needed by the
employee, in connection with a pregnancy loss, unsuccessful intrauterine
insemination or other assisted reproductive technology procedure, a failed
adoption or surrogacy arrangement, or other event impacting pregnancy or
fertility, to receive any needed procedures, medications, mental health
supports, or culturally responsive supports;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    time needed, up to three
working days, for any instance of bereavement for the death of a family member,
or for pregnancy loss;</p>

experiencing pregnancy loss, an unsuccessful assisted reproductive technology
procedure, a failed adoption match or surrogacy arrangement, or other event impacting
pregnancy or fertility;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill permits an employee
who is eligible for both earned sick leave and either temporary disability
benefits or family leave benefits to have the options of using either the
earned sick leave or whichever is applicable of temporary disability benefits
or family leave benefits, or both earned sick leave and disability or family
leave benefits, and of selecting the order in which the different kinds of
leave are taken.  The bill eliminates the current seven-day waiting period for
temporary disability benefits, to make those benefits more accessible to
employees, including for the purposes to which benefits are extended under the
bill.  It also facilitates greater access to use of the benefits by eliminating
the provisions of the Family Leave Act which exclude employees of companies
employing less than 30 employees from that laws provision of the right to be
reinstated after leave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also directs the Department

to the public, directly or in collaboration with governmental or
non-governmental entities, information regarding pregnancy loss, medically
appropriate treatment options, and benefits made available pursuant to the

to perinatal health care workers, current information regarding pregnancy loss
and treatment, including both physical and mental health care; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    expand and coordinate
programs to research causes of, and treatment for, pregnancy loss, and collect
and assess data regarding pregnancy loss, including demographic information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that all
costs of the publicity and studies are regarded as a cost of administration of
temporary disability and family leave insurance and charged to the
administration account of the State disability benefit fund, and modifies the
formula for determining the maximum assessment for those costs by updating the
wage data on which they are assessed to reflect recent changes in the determining
benefit amounts under those programs.</p>
