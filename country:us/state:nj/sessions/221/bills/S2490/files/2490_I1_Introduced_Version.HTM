<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require counties
and municipalities, and their agencies and authorities, and boards of education
to use the established competitive contracting process, and to follow new
supplemental requirements, for procuring any insurance products and insurance
consulting services.  Under current law, such contracts are exempt from public
bidding requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would require
boards of education and local contracting units seeking to procure any
insurance products and insurance consulting services to do so by the award of a
contract through the competitive contracting process set forth in sections 45
through 49 of P.L.1999, c.440 (C.18A:18A-4.1 et seq.) and sections 1 through 5
of P.L.1999, c.440 (C.40A:11-4.1 et seq.), as applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would supplement
these provisions with respect to insurance product and insurance consulting
service contracts as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     First, an insurance consultant
providing any insurance consultant services to a board of education or local
contracting unit would be required to be compensated directly and exclusively
by the board of education or local contracting unit at a fixed amount, an
hourly rate, or on another common and readily comparable basis, provided that
the compensation shall not be determined as a percentage of any insurance
product costs, and would not be permitted to accept any commission or other
form of compensation from an insurer for any insurance consultant services
provided to the board of education or local contracting unit.  Compensating
insurance consultants in this manner is intended to help ensure that their
interests are solely aligned with those of the board of education or local
contracting unit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Second, insurance consultants
and insurers would both be subject to several certification and disclosure
requirements related to the restrictions on insurance consultant compensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Third, the request for
proposal documentation would be required to include additional items including
the terms of compensation; the certification and disclosure requirements; the
penalties for violations; and certain details with respect to current insurance
use and anticipated insurance needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Fourth, the competitive
contracting proposal solicitation process would be supplemented in several
respects.  The notice of the availability of request for proposal documentation
would be required to be published through more outlets and in a new timeframe,
at least 60, but no more than 120, days prior to the date anticipated for the
commencement of the contract.  The request for proposal documentation would
also have to be submitted to at least one joint insurance fund, established
pursuant to N.J.S.40A:10-36 et seq., and with respect to health insurance, to
the State Health Benefits Plan, at the same time it is published.  Each
interested insurer or insurance consultant would be required to submit a
proposal at least 30 days prior to the date anticipated for the commencement of
the contract.  At least three proposals would be required to be obtained.  The
report evaluating and recommending the award of a contract or contracts would
be required to include an analysis and discussion of the availability, terms,
and price of comparable coverage from at least one joint insurance fund and,
with respect to health insurance, the State Health Benefits Plan, ensuring that
alternative insurance products available to the board of education or
contracting unit, which may be more cost-effective options, are considered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, this bill would
subject insurers and insurance consultants to civil liability for violations of
its provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Insurance is one of the major
expenses of boards of education and local contracting units.  Requiring boards
of education and local contracting units to use an open, transparent, and
competitive process for the award of insurance contracts would help ensure that
the lowest possible cost is realized and help protect against waste, abuse, and
insider deals, ultimately saving taxpayer money.  </p>
