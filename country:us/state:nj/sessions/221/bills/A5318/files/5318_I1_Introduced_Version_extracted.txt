STATEMENT This bill reduces the term of affordability required for affordable housing created through the construction or conversion of middle housing. Specifically, the bill requires that, in order to count towards a municipalitys affordable housing obligation, a unit of low- or moderate-income housing must have a term of affordability of not less than 10 years if the unit is created, and initially marketed as such, following the effective date of the bill as a newly constructed middle housing project, or as a part of a middle housing conversion.  In order to count towards a municipalitys affordable housing obligation under current law, a term of affordability is generally required to run for 30 or 40 years, depending on whether the unit is a for-sale or a rental unit.  The bill reduces this requirement for middle housing construction and conversion in order to encourage density, and discourage urban sprawl. The bill defines "middle housing" as a building which consists of no less than two and no more than four housing units.  The bill defines a "middle housing conversion" as the renovation, construction, or reconstruction of a building, which consists of no more than four housing units before the conversion, to increase the number of low- or moderate-income housing units in the building or in the land appurtenant. This bill takes effect immediately.

STATEMENT This bill reduces the term of affordability required for affordable housing created through the construction or conversion of middle housing. Specifically, the bill requires that, in order to count towards a municipalitys affordable housing obligation, a unit of low- or moderate-income housing must have a term of affordability of not less than 10 years if the unit is created, and initially marketed as such, following the effective date of the bill as a newly constructed middle housing project, or as a part of a middle housing conversion.  In order to count towards a municipalitys affordable housing obligation under current law, a term of affordability is generally required to run for 30 or 40 years, depending on whether the unit is a for-sale or a rental unit.  The bill reduces this requirement for middle housing construction and conversion in order to encourage density, and discourage urban sprawl. The bill defines "middle housing" as a building which consists of no less than two and no more than four housing units.  The bill defines a "middle housing conversion" as the renovation, construction, or reconstruction of a building, which consists of no more than four housing units before the conversion, to increase the number of low- or moderate-income housing units in the building or in the land appurtenant. This bill takes effect immediately.
