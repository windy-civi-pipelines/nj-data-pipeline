<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the New
Jersey Talent Retention Loan and Loan Redemption Program within the Higher
Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA).  The goal of the program is to
keep the most talented students in New Jersey from leaving the State during
college or at the beginning of their working career.  The program is a
financial aid program that offers certain New Jersey high school students who
attend college in New Jersey, loans of up to $10,000 per year and up to a
$40,000 maximum, and then forgiveness of those loans in exchange for employment
with certain New Jersey companies.  The companies that are eligible under this
program to employ students are the companies that provide the funding for the
loan program through donations to the New Jersey Talent Retention Loan Fund
which is also established in HESAA.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Employers that contribute to
the loan fund are eligible to take a tax credit equal to 50% of the amount
contributed in the taxable year of the contribution.  Contributions to the loan
fund will be used to fund loans for eligible students.  The employer is
eligible to take an additional tax credit equal to 50% of the contribution by
employing students who have received loans under the program upon their
graduation.  For every $40,000 contributed to the loan fund, an employer may
select a student who receives a loan under the program and that student is then
contractually obligated to apply to and accept an offer of employment with that
company before he is eligible to accept employment with any other company that
has made a contribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A student who wants to
participate in the program must submit an application to HESAA.  HESAA will
accept students in accordance with standards of academic merit that it is
directed to establish under the bill.  The accepted students will be placed on
a qualified applicants list.  Employers and HESAA will then select from among
the qualified applicants list to decide which students will be admitted into
the program.  Companies that contribute the greatest amount to the loan fund
will select first and then other companies will make selections in descending
order of contribution amount until all monies in the loan fund for that year
have been disbursed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A student admitted to the
program will then be eligible for a loan from HESAA of up to $10,000 per year
with a maximum amount of $40,000 for a baccalaureate degree program and $20,000
for an associate degree program.  After graduation, the student must obtain
employment with one of the employers that contributed to the loan fund.  If the
participant does not obtain employment with a qualified employer within 18
months of graduation, the participant will have to begin paying back the
loans.  If the participant does find employment with a qualified employer, the
student will have 25% of the loan amount redeemed for every 12 months of full
time employment, until the loan is completely forgiven.</p>
