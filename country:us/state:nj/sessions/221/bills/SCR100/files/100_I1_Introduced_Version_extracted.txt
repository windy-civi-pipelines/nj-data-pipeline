If you are opposed thereto make a cross (X), plus (+) or check (a) in the square opposite the word "No." b.  In every municipality the following question: CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT REQUIRING PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION FOR SURVIVING SPOUSE OF CERTAIN FIRST RESPONDERS YES Do you approve amending the State Constitution to provide a property tax exemption for a primary residence owned and occupied by the surviving spouse of a first responder who dies as a direct result of performing regular or assigned duties? The property is required to have been the primary residence of the first responder at the time of their death. A surviving spouse who remarries would no longer receive the exemption. INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This proposed constitutional amendment would provide a property tax exemption for the primary residence of the surviving spouse of a first responder who dies as a direct result of performing regular or assigned duties. The surviving spouse of a law enforcement officer, paid or volunteer firefighter, or paid or volunteer first aid, ambulance, or rescue squad member would receive the exemption. The property must be owned and occupied by the surviving spouse.  The property must also have been the primary residence of the first responder at the time of the first responders death. A death occurring due to the first responders willful negligence would not allow a surviving spouse to qualify for the property tax exemption. A surviving spouse would lose the property tax exemption if the spouse remarries. STATEMENT If approved by the voters, this proposed constitutional amendment would provide a property tax exemption for the primary residence owned and occupied by the surviving spouse of a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or first aid, ambulance, or rescue squad member who dies as a direct result of performing regular or assigned duties.  The exemption would include the surviving spouses of both paid and volunteer firefighters and first aid, ambulance, or rescue squad members.  The property tax exemption would not be provided to the surviving spouse of a first responder who dies as a direct result of the first responders own willful negligence. The property receiving the exemption is also required to have been the primary residence of the first responder at the time of the first responders death. A surviving spouse would qualify for the exemption, and continue to receive it, for as long as the spouse owns and occupies the home as a primary residence and does not remarry.
