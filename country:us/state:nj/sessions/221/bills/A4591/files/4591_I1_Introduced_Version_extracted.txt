A4591 ASSEMBLY, No. 4591 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 17, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  WAYNE P. DEANGELO District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) Assemblyman  CHRISTIAN E. BARRANCO District 25 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Establishes "Energy Infrastructure Public-Private Partnerships Program"; amends law concerning NJ Infrastructure Bank; and authorizes certain energy contracts under "Public School Contracts Law" and "Local Public Contracts Law" up to 25 years. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning energy infrastructure public-private partnerships, supplementing Titles 52 and 58 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.1985, c.334, N.J.S.18A:18A-42, and P.L.1971, c.198. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  (New section) Sections 1 through 20 of P.L.    , c.    (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the "Energy Infrastructure Public-Private Partnerships Act." 2.  (New section)  a.  The Legislature finds and declares that: (1) It is the public policy of this State to assure that the State's energy infrastructure is developed and maintained in a manner that assures, to the greatest extent possible, the availability of reliable and resilient state-of-the-art energy resources to the State and, in particular, to the critical facilities that provide necessary lifeline services to the State's citizens and businesses; (2) The recent occurrence of severe weather events, and the current condition of the State's aging energy systems underscore the vulnerability of the State's energy infrastructure and the substantial and immediate need for the State to improve the energy resources available to State, county, and municipal facilities that provide critical lifeline services, including hospitals, police and fire departments, water and wastewater treatment facilities, shelters, colleges, universities, schools, and prisons; (3)  The urgent need to decarbonize the energy sector will require a significant expansion of intermittent renewable energy sources.  In order to facilitate the expansion of solar photovoltaic and wind resources, the State's infrastructure must include dispatchable resources at the location of use in order to mitigate the significant economic and potential physical damage that could result from poor power quality issues.  Grid-edge, on-demand energy generation that is efficient and clean is necessary to support the continued development of renewable resources; (4) The reliability, resiliency, and efficiency of the State's energy infrastructure will be improved if the State encourages the development of the energy-related projects contemplated by P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which will reduce the vulnerability of critical facilities to threats posed by weather and other exogenous factors, minimize equipment failures caused by deterioration, disrepair, and obsolescence, enhance the production and delivery of energy, including clean energy resources, improve the energy efficiency of facilities, reduce peak demand, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions, and promote economic development and foster job creation; (5) The implementation of energy-related projects through public-private partnerships will enable the State to leverage the capital and expertise of the private sector, which will permit needed energy-related projects to be developed, in many instances on a self-funded basis, without taxpayer or ratepayer support; and (6) The use of energy infrastructure public-private partnerships will contribute to the attainment of the goals of the State's Energy Master Plan, which include aggressive initiatives to expand the implementation of renewable energy and building and transportation decarbonization initiatives, improve energy reliability and resiliency, and introduce state-of-the-art technologies that can make buildings more energy efficient and reduce energy usage, peak demand, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. b.    The Legislature therefore determines that: (1) It shall be the public policy of this State to foster energy public-private partnerships to develop state-of-the-art energy-related projects that obviate or minimize the need for capital investments in such projects by governmental entities, taxpayers, and utility ratepayers; (2) In order to foster the energy-related projects contemplated by P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), it is necessary and appropriate for the Legislature to authorize the use of public-private partnerships that leverage private sector financial resources and expertise and provide a platform for governmental and private entities to share the responsibilities and benefits of these projects; (3) Current economic conditions, combined with the critical and immediate need to improve the State's energy infrastructure and achieve the State's near and long-term energy goals, compel the State to pursue the energy-related public-private partnerships contemplated by P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which will enhance the reliability, resilience, and efficiency of the State's energy infrastructure. by introducing state-of-the-art energy technologies; and (4) The energy-related public-private partnerships contemplated by P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) will encourage private capital investment and leverage the technical, financial, and managerial expertise of the private sector to assist eligible public entities that otherwise lack the necessary capital, resources, or expertise to design, develop, own, manage, operate, and maintain needed energy infrastructure projects. 3.    (New section) As used in sections 1 through 20 of P.L.    , c.

The Legislature further finds that funding at the federal level for wastewater treatment, stormwater management and combined sewer system rehabilitation projects is insufficient; that State funds available for these projects are inadequate to meet current needs; that local revenues are insufficient to meet these expenses; and that additional funding at the State level is necessary to meet this financial obligation. c.     The Legislature finds that construction, rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of modern and efficient water supply facilities are essential to protecting and improving the State's water quality; that the citizens of this State, in recognition of the crucial role the construction of new and the upgrading of existing water supply facilities play in maintaining and augmenting the natural water resources of the State, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited financial resource capabilities of local governments and authorities and must be subsidized by the State and repaid through a system of water supply user charges, approved the enactment of the "Water Supply Bond Act of 1981" (P.L.1981, c.261); that the water supply needs of the State are so great that the funds allocated for this purpose from the "Water Supply Fund" established by that 1981 bond act should be augmented and maximized, to the extent practicable, through the use of alternative methods of State financing to offset the costs of water supply projects and for the construction of new or the rehabilitation of antiquated or inadequate existing water supply facilities; that the United States Congress in recognition of the essential role that safe drinking water plays in protecting the public health, and with an understanding that financing, constructing and maintaining water systems that meet the requirements of the "Safe Drinking Water Act," 42 U.S.C. s.300f et seq. exceed the financial and technical capacity of the operators of some water systems, has established in the "Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996," P.L.104-182, a program to provide public water systems with financial assistance to meet national primary drinking water regulations or to otherwise further the health protection objectives of the federal law and that the State must, in order to make use of the federal funds, provide State funds for the program; and therefore, State funding for the program is necessary to meet this financial obligation. d.    The Legislature finds that the transportation infrastructure of the State is among the most heavily used in the nation and has deteriorated in recent years, with parts of the highway system reaching the end of their useful lives. e.     The Legislature finds that capital projects for roadways and bridges are essential to protecting and improving the State's transportation system; that construction of new and the upgrading of existing roadways and bridges play a critical role in the transportation needs of the State, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited financial resource capabilities of local governments and authorities and must be subsidized by the State and Federal government; that the United States Congress has established "State Infrastructure Bank" programs to provide funding for transportation systems (23 U.S.C. s.610) and that the State must, in order to make use of the federal funds, provide State funds for the program; and therefore, State funding for the program is necessary to meet this financial obligation. f.  The Legislature finds that energy-related projects are essential to improve the reliability, resiliency, and efficiency of the energy infrastructure owned or utilized by local government units, water systems, and various other entities located within the State, and to reduce energy usage, peak demand, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. g.  The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the public interest to establish a State authority authorized to issue bonds, notes and other obligations and to establish any reserve funds necessary therefor, and to make loans to and guarantee debt incurred by local government units for environmental and transportation infrastructure projects , and to make loans and provide other assistance to certain public-private partnership eligible entities to finance the cost of energy-related projects .

(C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) to the contrary, all monies placed into the State Energy Infrastructure Bank Fund shall be held separate from other funds of the trust, and no funds used to finance energy-related projects shall be combined or comingled with any funds that finance (1) wastewater treatment system projects, (2) water supply projects, (3) other environmental infrastructure projects, or (4) transportation, transit, marine or aviation projects, which are not energy-related projects. c.  The trust may establish or direct the establishment of federal and State accounts or subaccounts as may be necessary to meet any applicable federal law requirements or desirable for the efficient administration of the trust. 31.  (New section) a.  The trust, through the Energy P3 Program, shall for each fiscal year, develop a priority system for energy-related projects that seek financing from the Energy Infrastructure Financing Program.  The trust shall maintain an Energy Infrastructure Financing Program Project Priority List, hereinafter referred to as the Energy Project Priority List, which shall identify the energy-related projects that the trust has selected for funding in each fiscal year and the aggregate amount of funds the trust has authorized for this purpose.  The Energy Project Priority List shall provide a description of each project and an explanation of how the projects are ranked. The Energy Project Priority List shall be submitted to the Legislature for the fiscal year on or before January 15 of each year.  The Secretary and the Clerk shall cause the date of submission to be entered upon the Senate Journal and the Minutes of the General Assembly, respectively.  Incremental revisions or supplements to the Energy Project Priority List may be submitted to the Legislature as provided in subsection g. of section 9 of P.L.1985, c.334 (C.58:11B-9).  An energy-related project shall be eligible for funding pursuant to this section if it is identified on an Energy Project Priority List. Energy-related projects that do not seek financing from the trust shall not be subject to prioritization in accordance with this section and shall be considered on their own merit in accordance with the general review criteria established pursuant to section 16 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  The trust shall prepare an Energy Financing Program Project Eligibility List for long-term funding by the trust and shall include the aggregate amount of funds to be authorized for these purposes.

(cf: P.L.2019, c.79, s.1) 45.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, entitled the "Energy Infrastructure Public-Private Partnership Act," would permit private entities to propose to public-private partnership eligible entities, as defined in the bill, certain energy-related projects through a public-private partnership (P3) agreement.  The bill would create an Energy Infrastructure Public-Private Partnership Program (Energy P3 Program) and an Energy Infrastructure Financing Program within the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (NJIB). The Energy P3 Program would be responsible for the formulation and execution of a comprehensive Statewide policy for P3 agreements that facilitate the development of energy-related projects and for the development, promotion, coordination, oversight, and approval of P3 agreements for energy-related projects.  The Energy Infrastructure Financing Program would provide loans and other forms of financial assistance to P3 eligible entities that are parties to public-private partnership agreements to develop and finance energy-related projects pursuant to the bill. The bill defines "public-private partnership eligible entity," or "P3 eligible entity," as the State, its subdivisions, and any department, agency, commission, authority, board, or instrumentality thereof, a county, a municipality, a board of education, a State college or university, a county college, a private not-for-profit higher education institution, a regional or municipal utility authority, a quasi-State agency, a State-created corporation, and a private not-for-profit hospital licensed by the Department of Health pursuant to the "Health Care Facilities Planning Act," P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). The Energy P3 Program would consult and coordinate with representatives of other State departments, agencies, boards, and authorities to accomplish the goals of the bill and facilitate P3 agreements for energy-related projects.  The bill directs the NJIB to develop criteria by which a P3 eligible entity would award an energy-related project to a private entity whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous.  The bill prescribes competitive contracting procedures to govern P3 agreements, including procurements and prevailing wage requirements for workers engaged in construction activities and other worker protections, and provides oversight authority to the Energy P3 Program to protect the interests of participating entities.  The bill permits the inclusion of a project labor agreement in all energy-related projects created pursuant to the provisions of the bill.  The bill also requires, beginning three years after the bill is enacted into law, an annual report concerning energy-related P3 projects to be submitted to the Governor and to the Legislature. The bill amends the "New Jersey Infrastructure Trust Act" to establish an Energy Infrastructure Financing Program in the NJIB to provide loans and other forms of financial assistance, as the NJIB deems appropriate, to P3 eligible entities and private entities that are parties to P3 agreements to develop and finance energy-related projects pursuant to the bill.  The bill would also add the President of the Board of Public Utilities as an ex-officio member to the board of directors for the NJIB. The bill makes various changes to existing statutes related to the NJIB in order to expand its mission from water, environmental infrastructure, and transportation projects, to include energy-related projects.  The bill requires that funds and accounts of the NJIB be segregated in such a way as to prevent the mixing of transportation monies and water or environmental infrastructure monies with energy-related monies. The bill creates an interim financing program for energy-related projects and establishes an Energy Loan Origination Fee Fund similar to the existing interim financing programs and fee funds for environmental and transportation projects. The bill would require the NJIB to submit to the Legislature, on or before May 15 of each year, a financial plan designed to implement the financing of the energy-related projects on the Energy Financing Program Project Priority List or the Energy Financing Program Project Eligibility List.  The bill provides that on or before June 30 of each year the Legislature may reject the financial plan through the adoption by both houses of a concurrent resolution.  If the Legislature rejects the financial plan, the project list would be removed from the annual appropriations act and the NJIB would not undertake any of the proposed activities contained in the plan.  If the Legislature takes no action on the financial plan on or before June 30, the financial plan would be deemed approved. Under the bill, the development of an energy-related project would be deemed to constitute the performance of an essential public function.  A component of an energy-related project predominantly used by, or developed in furtherance of the purposes of a P3 eligible entity that is owned by or leased to a P3 eligible entity, foreign or domestic nonprofit business entity, or business entity wholly owned by a nonprofit business entity, would be exempt from property taxation and special assessments of the State, a municipality, and any other political subdivision of the State, and, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, would not be required to make payments in lieu of taxes, and the land upon which an energy-related project is located would be exempt from property taxation for the useful life of the project. The bill provides that the provisions of P.L.2009, c.136 (the requirements for certain public contracts with private firms) do not apply to energy-related projects developed under the bill.  The bill also provides that nothing in the bill limits the powers of the Office of the State Comptroller or the authority of the Board of Public Utilities. Finally, the bill amends the "Public School Contracts Law" and the "Local Public Contracts Law" to provide that a contract may be for up to 25 years for the sale of electricity or thermal energy, or both, produced by a combined heat and power facility, cogeneration facility, on-site generation facility, a district energy system, or a distributed electric generation resource constructed and operated pursuant to a public-private partnership agreement under the bill.

A4591 ASSEMBLY, No. 4591 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 17, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  WAYNE P. DEANGELO District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) Assemblyman  CHRISTIAN E. BARRANCO District 25 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Establishes "Energy Infrastructure Public-Private Partnerships Program"; amends law concerning NJ Infrastructure Bank; and authorizes certain energy contracts under "Public School Contracts Law" and "Local Public Contracts Law" up to 25 years. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning energy infrastructure public-private partnerships, supplementing Titles 52 and 58 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.1985, c.334, N.J.S.18A:18A-42, and P.L.1971, c.198. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  (New section) Sections 1 through 20 of P.L.    , c.    (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the "Energy Infrastructure Public-Private Partnerships Act." 2.  (New section)  a.  The Legislature finds and declares that: (1) It is the public policy of this State to assure that the State's energy infrastructure is developed and maintained in a manner that assures, to the greatest extent possible, the availability of reliable and resilient state-of-the-art energy resources to the State and, in particular, to the critical facilities that provide necessary lifeline services to the State's citizens and businesses; (2) The recent occurrence of severe weather events, and the current condition of the State's aging energy systems underscore the vulnerability of the State's energy infrastructure and the substantial and immediate need for the State to improve the energy resources available to State, county, and municipal facilities that provide critical lifeline services, including hospitals, police and fire departments, water and wastewater treatment facilities, shelters, colleges, universities, schools, and prisons; (3)  The urgent need to decarbonize the energy sector will require a significant expansion of intermittent renewable energy sources.  In order to facilitate the expansion of solar photovoltaic and wind resources, the State's infrastructure must include dispatchable resources at the location of use in order to mitigate the significant economic and potential physical damage that could result from poor power quality issues.  Grid-edge, on-demand energy generation that is efficient and clean is necessary to support the continued development of renewable resources; (4) The reliability, resiliency, and efficiency of the State's energy infrastructure will be improved if the State encourages the development of the energy-related projects contemplated by P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which will reduce the vulnerability of critical facilities to threats posed by weather and other exogenous factors, minimize equipment failures caused by deterioration, disrepair, and obsolescence, enhance the production and delivery of energy, including clean energy resources, improve the energy efficiency of facilities, reduce peak demand, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions, and promote economic development and foster job creation; (5) The implementation of energy-related projects through public-private partnerships will enable the State to leverage the capital and expertise of the private sector, which will permit needed energy-related projects to be developed, in many instances on a self-funded basis, without taxpayer or ratepayer support; and (6) The use of energy infrastructure public-private partnerships will contribute to the attainment of the goals of the State's Energy Master Plan, which include aggressive initiatives to expand the implementation of renewable energy and building and transportation decarbonization initiatives, improve energy reliability and resiliency, and introduce state-of-the-art technologies that can make buildings more energy efficient and reduce energy usage, peak demand, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. b.    The Legislature therefore determines that: (1) It shall be the public policy of this State to foster energy public-private partnerships to develop state-of-the-art energy-related projects that obviate or minimize the need for capital investments in such projects by governmental entities, taxpayers, and utility ratepayers; (2) In order to foster the energy-related projects contemplated by P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), it is necessary and appropriate for the Legislature to authorize the use of public-private partnerships that leverage private sector financial resources and expertise and provide a platform for governmental and private entities to share the responsibilities and benefits of these projects; (3) Current economic conditions, combined with the critical and immediate need to improve the State's energy infrastructure and achieve the State's near and long-term energy goals, compel the State to pursue the energy-related public-private partnerships contemplated by P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which will enhance the reliability, resilience, and efficiency of the State's energy infrastructure. by introducing state-of-the-art energy technologies; and (4) The energy-related public-private partnerships contemplated by P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) will encourage private capital investment and leverage the technical, financial, and managerial expertise of the private sector to assist eligible public entities that otherwise lack the necessary capital, resources, or expertise to design, develop, own, manage, operate, and maintain needed energy infrastructure projects. 3.    (New section) As used in sections 1 through 20 of P.L.    , c.

The Legislature further finds that funding at the federal level for wastewater treatment, stormwater management and combined sewer system rehabilitation projects is insufficient; that State funds available for these projects are inadequate to meet current needs; that local revenues are insufficient to meet these expenses; and that additional funding at the State level is necessary to meet this financial obligation. c.     The Legislature finds that construction, rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of modern and efficient water supply facilities are essential to protecting and improving the State's water quality; that the citizens of this State, in recognition of the crucial role the construction of new and the upgrading of existing water supply facilities play in maintaining and augmenting the natural water resources of the State, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited financial resource capabilities of local governments and authorities and must be subsidized by the State and repaid through a system of water supply user charges, approved the enactment of the "Water Supply Bond Act of 1981" (P.L.1981, c.261); that the water supply needs of the State are so great that the funds allocated for this purpose from the "Water Supply Fund" established by that 1981 bond act should be augmented and maximized, to the extent practicable, through the use of alternative methods of State financing to offset the costs of water supply projects and for the construction of new or the rehabilitation of antiquated or inadequate existing water supply facilities; that the United States Congress in recognition of the essential role that safe drinking water plays in protecting the public health, and with an understanding that financing, constructing and maintaining water systems that meet the requirements of the "Safe Drinking Water Act," 42 U.S.C. s.300f et seq. exceed the financial and technical capacity of the operators of some water systems, has established in the "Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996," P.L.104-182, a program to provide public water systems with financial assistance to meet national primary drinking water regulations or to otherwise further the health protection objectives of the federal law and that the State must, in order to make use of the federal funds, provide State funds for the program; and therefore, State funding for the program is necessary to meet this financial obligation. d.    The Legislature finds that the transportation infrastructure of the State is among the most heavily used in the nation and has deteriorated in recent years, with parts of the highway system reaching the end of their useful lives. e.     The Legislature finds that capital projects for roadways and bridges are essential to protecting and improving the State's transportation system; that construction of new and the upgrading of existing roadways and bridges play a critical role in the transportation needs of the State, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited financial resource capabilities of local governments and authorities and must be subsidized by the State and Federal government; that the United States Congress has established "State Infrastructure Bank" programs to provide funding for transportation systems (23 U.S.C. s.610) and that the State must, in order to make use of the federal funds, provide State funds for the program; and therefore, State funding for the program is necessary to meet this financial obligation. f.  The Legislature finds that energy-related projects are essential to improve the reliability, resiliency, and efficiency of the energy infrastructure owned or utilized by local government units, water systems, and various other entities located within the State, and to reduce energy usage, peak demand, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. g.  The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the public interest to establish a State authority authorized to issue bonds, notes and other obligations and to establish any reserve funds necessary therefor, and to make loans to and guarantee debt incurred by local government units for environmental and transportation infrastructure projects , and to make loans and provide other assistance to certain public-private partnership eligible entities to finance the cost of energy-related projects .

(cf: P.L.2019, c.79, s.1) 45.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, entitled the "Energy Infrastructure Public-Private Partnership Act," would permit private entities to propose to public-private partnership eligible entities, as defined in the bill, certain energy-related projects through a public-private partnership (P3) agreement.  The bill would create an Energy Infrastructure Public-Private Partnership Program (Energy P3 Program) and an Energy Infrastructure Financing Program within the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (NJIB). The Energy P3 Program would be responsible for the formulation and execution of a comprehensive Statewide policy for P3 agreements that facilitate the development of energy-related projects and for the development, promotion, coordination, oversight, and approval of P3 agreements for energy-related projects.  The Energy Infrastructure Financing Program would provide loans and other forms of financial assistance to P3 eligible entities that are parties to public-private partnership agreements to develop and finance energy-related projects pursuant to the bill. The bill defines "public-private partnership eligible entity," or "P3 eligible entity," as the State, its subdivisions, and any department, agency, commission, authority, board, or instrumentality thereof, a county, a municipality, a board of education, a State college or university, a county college, a private not-for-profit higher education institution, a regional or municipal utility authority, a quasi-State agency, a State-created corporation, and a private not-for-profit hospital licensed by the Department of Health pursuant to the "Health Care Facilities Planning Act," P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). The Energy P3 Program would consult and coordinate with representatives of other State departments, agencies, boards, and authorities to accomplish the goals of the bill and facilitate P3 agreements for energy-related projects.  The bill directs the NJIB to develop criteria by which a P3 eligible entity would award an energy-related project to a private entity whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous.  The bill prescribes competitive contracting procedures to govern P3 agreements, including procurements and prevailing wage requirements for workers engaged in construction activities and other worker protections, and provides oversight authority to the Energy P3 Program to protect the interests of participating entities.  The bill permits the inclusion of a project labor agreement in all energy-related projects created pursuant to the provisions of the bill.  The bill also requires, beginning three years after the bill is enacted into law, an annual report concerning energy-related P3 projects to be submitted to the Governor and to the Legislature. The bill amends the "New Jersey Infrastructure Trust Act" to establish an Energy Infrastructure Financing Program in the NJIB to provide loans and other forms of financial assistance, as the NJIB deems appropriate, to P3 eligible entities and private entities that are parties to P3 agreements to develop and finance energy-related projects pursuant to the bill.  The bill would also add the President of the Board of Public Utilities as an ex-officio member to the board of directors for the NJIB. The bill makes various changes to existing statutes related to the NJIB in order to expand its mission from water, environmental infrastructure, and transportation projects, to include energy-related projects.  The bill requires that funds and accounts of the NJIB be segregated in such a way as to prevent the mixing of transportation monies and water or environmental infrastructure monies with energy-related monies. The bill creates an interim financing program for energy-related projects and establishes an Energy Loan Origination Fee Fund similar to the existing interim financing programs and fee funds for environmental and transportation projects. The bill would require the NJIB to submit to the Legislature, on or before May 15 of each year, a financial plan designed to implement the financing of the energy-related projects on the Energy Financing Program Project Priority List or the Energy Financing Program Project Eligibility List.  The bill provides that on or before June 30 of each year the Legislature may reject the financial plan through the adoption by both houses of a concurrent resolution.  If the Legislature rejects the financial plan, the project list would be removed from the annual appropriations act and the NJIB would not undertake any of the proposed activities contained in the plan.  If the Legislature takes no action on the financial plan on or before June 30, the financial plan would be deemed approved. Under the bill, the development of an energy-related project would be deemed to constitute the performance of an essential public function.  A component of an energy-related project predominantly used by, or developed in furtherance of the purposes of a P3 eligible entity that is owned by or leased to a P3 eligible entity, foreign or domestic nonprofit business entity, or business entity wholly owned by a nonprofit business entity, would be exempt from property taxation and special assessments of the State, a municipality, and any other political subdivision of the State, and, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, would not be required to make payments in lieu of taxes, and the land upon which an energy-related project is located would be exempt from property taxation for the useful life of the project. The bill provides that the provisions of P.L.2009, c.136 (the requirements for certain public contracts with private firms) do not apply to energy-related projects developed under the bill.  The bill also provides that nothing in the bill limits the powers of the Office of the State Comptroller or the authority of the Board of Public Utilities. Finally, the bill amends the "Public School Contracts Law" and the "Local Public Contracts Law" to provide that a contract may be for up to 25 years for the sale of electricity or thermal energy, or both, produced by a combined heat and power facility, cogeneration facility, on-site generation facility, a district energy system, or a distributed electric generation resource constructed and operated pursuant to a public-private partnership agreement under the bill.
