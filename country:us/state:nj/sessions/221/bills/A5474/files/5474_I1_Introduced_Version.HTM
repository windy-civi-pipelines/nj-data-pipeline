<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.19:8-2 is amended to
read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     19:8-2.  The clerk of every
municipality, on or before April 1 shall certify to the county board of every
county wherein such municipality is located a suggested list of places in the
municipality suitable for polling places.  The county board shall select the
polling places for the election districts in the municipalities of the county
for all elections in the municipalities thereof, including all commission
government elections in the county.  The county boards shall not be obliged to
select the polling places so suggested by the municipal clerks, but may choose
others where they may deem it expedient.  Preference in locations shall be
given to schools and public buildings where space shall be made available by
the authorities in charge, upon request, if same can be done without
detrimental interruption of school or the usual public services thereof, and
for which the authority in charge shall be reimbursed, by agreement, for
expenses of light, janitorial and other attending services arising from such
use.  Each polling place selected shall be accessible to individuals with
disabilities and the elderly.  A polling place shall be considered accessible
if it is in compliance with the federal &quot;Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990&quot; (42 U.S.C. s. 12101 et seq.).  <u>A polling place shall not be
selected unless it is accessible and conveniently located for all voters within
the election district.</u>  In no case shall the authorities in charge of a
public school or other public building deny the request of the county board for
the use, as a polling place, of any building they own or lease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Where the county board shall
fail to agree as to the selection of the polling place or places for any
election district, within five days of an election, the county clerk shall
select and designate the polling place or places in any such election district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The county board may select a
polling place other than a schoolhouse or public building outside of the
district but such polling place shall not be located more than 1,000 feet distant
from the boundary line of the district.  The Secretary of State may, however,
permit a polling place to be more than 1,000 feet distant from the boundary
line of the district if there is no suitable polling place accessible to
individuals with disabilities and the elderly within the district or 1,000 feet
distant from the boundary line of the district<u>, provided that the selection
of such polling place does not impose a severe burden on the voters in the
election district so as to disenfranchise such voters</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever possible, the county
board shall contact the managers or owners of commercial or private buildings
that the board deems suitable to use as polling places, and are in or near an
election district lacking an accessible polling place, to determine whether a
portion of such a building may be used as a polling place on the day of an
election.  Reimbursement for the use of a portion of such a building shall be
the same as provided by this section for schools and public buildings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Neither the owner nor operator
of a facility designated as a polling place by the county board is permitted or
authorized to relocate the polling place room in the building without the
express prior approval of the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill defines and
prohibits conduct which constitutes voter disenfranchisement in this State and
establishes a mechanism for enforcement.  In doing so, the bill intends to
safeguard the fundamental right to vote and deter bad actors that would seek to
undermine this right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, to
disenfranchise a voter means to deny or abridge the right of an individual to
vote in an election in this State or to register to vote in this State,
including by engaging in conduct prohibited by the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits public
entities and elections officials from requiring voters or prospective voters to
provide identification in order to vote or to register to vote, except when
otherwise required by law.  The bill also prohibits any person from knowingly
and willfully providing false information regarding the eligibility of a person
to register to vote, or how, when, or where a person may cast their vote which,
if believed, would result in the person being denied their right to vote.  Any
person who engages in this conduct is guilty of a crime of the second degree,
and any election official who engages in this conduct will additionally be barred
from serving as an elections official permanently.  A crime of the second
degree is punishable by imprisonment for five to 10 years, a fine of up to
$150,000, or both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a person is
also prohibited from knowingly and willfully intimidating, threatening, or
coercing any person for registering to vote, voting or attempting to register
to vote, and from knowingly and willfully depriving or defrauding the residents
of this State of a fair and impartially conducted election.  These are crimes
of the second degree as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, polling
places selected for the conduct of elections are required to be accessible to
the elderly and persons with disabilities.  This bill ensures that, in making
such selections, the polling places will be accessible to all voters in the
election district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law allows for
selecting polling places which are up to 1,000 feet outside of the election
district, with the permission of the Secretary of State.  The bill requires
that, if such a polling place is selected, it must not impose a severe burden
on voters in the election district that it could result in some voters being
disenfranchised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, any voter or
prospective voter who is disenfranchised is authorized to bring a civil action
in the Superior Court of the county in which the violation occurred and any
organization, entity, or person found to have disenfranchised a voter or
prospective voter will be liable for damages, including nominal and punitive
damages, in an amount that the court shall deem necessary and appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
establishes an Independent Election Oversight Committee to investigate and
pursue reports of voter disenfranchisement.  The committee will consist of
seven total members, six of whom will be appointed, and the seventh will be the
Secretary of State, or their designee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The appointed members of the
committee will serve three year terms and until a successor is appointed.  Any
vacancy in the membership of the committee will be filled for the unexpired
term in the manner in which the original appointment was made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The committee will solicit and
accept information from members of the public related to the conduct of
elections and reports of voter disenfranchisement occurring in this State, and
investigate such reports.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any employee who reports
incidents of voter disenfranchisement being conducted by their employer, or who
provides information to the committee in furtherance of an investigation into
their employer, will be subject to the protections of the &quot;Conscientious
Employee Protection Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the committee finds that a
voter has been disenfranchised, the committee may impose a reasonable fine on
the parties responsible in light of the totality of the circumstances.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All fines collected will be
used exclusively in furtherance of the committees work to prevent and remedy
instances of voter disenfranchisement in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to any fines
imposed, the committee may refer any identified violations of law to the
Attorney General, county prosecutor, or another appropriate law enforcement
agency for further investigation and prosecution.  </p>

any pertinent information discovered in the course of an investigation to State
or local agencies that oversee the issuance of a license or permit which was
used to further conduct that disenfranchised voters or prospective voters. 
Such agencies may suspend or revoke licenses or permits so used, and may
restrict the organization, entity, or person responsible from acquiring such
licenses or permits in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, all poll
workers in this State will be instructed in their poll worker training on the
kinds of conduct which may be considered voter disenfranchisement.  Poll
workers will be instructed on how to avoid this and how to report instances of
voter disenfranchisement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the
Secretary of State to commission an audit in every year in which there is a
general election for all members of the General Assembly in order to asses
elections policies and procedures and identify policies and procedures which
may result in the disenfranchisement of voters in this State.  The audit will
recommend changes which should be made to election policies and procedures, and
a final report of the audit will be published online.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill directs the
Division of Elections and the county clerks in each county to conduct a public
awareness campaign to inform all residents as to their right to vote in
elections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill appropriates $100,000
for purposes of the audit and public awareness campaign. </p>
