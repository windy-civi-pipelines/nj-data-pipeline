briefly describing the property for which exemption is claimed and having
annexed thereto a certificate of the claimant's honorable discharge or release
under honorable circumstances, from active service in any branch of the Armed
Forces of the United States and a certificate from the United States Department
of Veterans' Affairs or its successor, certifying to a service-connected
disability of such claimant of the character described in section 1 of

claimant's legal residence in this State; that the veteran shall have been
declared, either during the veteran's lifetime or after the veteran's death, by
the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs to have or to have had a
service-connected disability of a character described in this act, or, in the
case of a claim for an exemption under subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.1948,
c.259 (C.54:4-3.30), that the veteran shall have been declared to have died in
active service; that the veteran was entitled to an exemption provided for in
this act, except for an exemption under paragraph (2) of subsection b. and
subsection c. of section 1 hereof, at the time of death; and that the claimant
is a resident of this State and has not remarried.  Such exemptions shall be
allowed and prorated by the assessor for the remainder of any taxable year from
the date the claimant shall have acquired title to the real property intended
to be exempt by this act. Where a portion of a multiple-family building or
structure occupied by the claimant is the subject of such exemption, the assessor
shall aggregate the assessment on the lot or curtilage and building or
structure and allow an exemption of that percentage of the aggregate assessment
as the value of the portion of the building or structure occupied by the
claimant bears to the value of the entire building or structure.</p>
