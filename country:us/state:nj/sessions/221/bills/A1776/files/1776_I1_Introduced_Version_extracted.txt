(cf: P.L.2004, c.17, s.3) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to any action filed on or after the effective date, including but not limited to matters where the statute of limitations has expired and matters filed with a court have not yet been dismissed with prejudice or finally adjudicated as of the effective date. The provisions of this act shall also revive any action that was previously dismissed on grounds that the applicable statute of limitations had expired but shall not revive any action previously dismissed on any other grounds or revive any action that has been finally adjudicated.

There is an exception to this two-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions by or on behalf of minors for injuries sustained at the minors birth. This bill would provide that in the case of lawsuits for injuries sustained as a result of sexual assault or any other crime or offense of a sexual nature committed against a person 18 years of age or older, there would be no statute of limitations and the lawsuit may be commenced at any time. The bill would be retroactive, applying to matters where the statute of limitations has expired and matters filed with a court that have not yet been dismissed with prejudice or finally adjudicated as of the effective date. The provisions of the bill would also revive any action that was previously dismissed on grounds that the applicable statute of limitations had expired.  The bill would not revive any action previously dismissed on any other grounds or revive any action that has been finally adjudicated.
