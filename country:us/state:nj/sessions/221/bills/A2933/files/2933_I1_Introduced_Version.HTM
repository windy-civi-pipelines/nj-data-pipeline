This DSP Shore Municipality Monitoring Unit would be responsible for monitoring social media for notices of unpermitted mass gatherings on public beaches that are anticipated to attract a crowd of 500 or more people. Additionally, funds are to be utilized by the DSP Shore Municipality Monitoring Unit to assist local law enforcement agencies in ensuring those unpermitted gatherings remain orderly. On May 21, 2022 the municipality of Long Branch, New Jersey experienced one of these unpermitted mass gatherings after a social media posting drew large crowds that authorities said threatened public safety. First responders reportedly included the Long Branch Police Department, Monmouth County Prosecutors Office, Monmouth County Emergency Response Team (MOCERT), Monmouth and Middlesex Rapid Deployment Forces (RDF), Monmouth County Sheriffs Office, New Jersey State Police, Department of Corrections, and NJ Transit Police.  Last summer, there were several similar situations of large-scale pop-up parties in the same area of the State. These unpermitted mass gatherings affect not only public safety when not patrolled effectively, but also affect the economic wellbeing of businesses who rely on visitors to the New Jersey shore during the summer season.
