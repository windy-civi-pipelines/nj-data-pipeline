Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Adult in crisis means an eligible
adult who is experiencing a behavioral health crisis.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Behavioral health crisis
means an emergency or crisis situation in which an eligible adult experiences
mental, emotional, or behavioral health challenges that endanger the health,
safety, or wellbeing of the adult or other persons, and which cannot be
controlled or otherwise properly addressed or stabilized by the adult, or by
the adults family members, attendant caregivers, or direct care staff members,
without professional assistance.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Crisis management and
stabilization plan means an individualized, person-centered service plan,
which identifies target behaviors to be addressed in, desired outcomes to be
attained by, and necessary START services to be provided to, an eligible adult,
as may be necessary to enable the adult and his or her family members,
guardian, caregivers, and direct support staff to prevent future crisis
situations and, when a behavioral health crisis does occur, to effectively
stabilize the adult in a non-clinical, community-based therapeutic respite
home, without necessitating the use of emergency medical services or
institutional treatment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Crisis response services or
crisis response means face-to-face, non-medical emergency counseling and
therapeutic services, which are provided to an adult in crisis in order to
de-escalate and stabilize the behavioral health crisis being experienced
thereby.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Developmental disability
means the same as that term is defined by section 3 of P.L.1977, c.82
(C.30:6D-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Eligible adult means a
person who has both a developmental disability and a mental illness and is
eligible for services from the Department of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Home means a private
residence or a community-based residential facility, such as a group home or
halfway house, where an eligible adult is a resident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Mental illness means the
same as that term is defined by section 2 of P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Pilot START program or
pilot program means the pilot program established pursuant to section 2 of
this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Respite bed means an
available bed in a therapeutic respite home, which is dedicated for use by an
eligible adult who is not in crisis, but whose crisis management and
stabilization plan provides for the occasional use of therapeutic respite
services as a means by which to prevent the onset of a behavioral health
crisis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Stabilization or stabilize
means the stabilization of an adult in crisis, which is effectuated by a crisis
response team, by staff at a therapeutic respite home, or by the family
members, guardian, or caregivers of the adult in crisis, and which effectively
calms and stabilizes the behavior of the adult in crisis, and removes the
potential for danger arising out of the crisis situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Stabilization bed means an available
bed in a therapeutic respite home, which is dedicated for use by an adult in
crisis who actively requires stabilization.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     START services means the
systemic, therapeutic, assessment, resource, and treatment services, identified
in subsection c. of section 2 of this act, which are made available to eligible
adults through the pilot START program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Therapeutic respite home
means a community-based facility, or a part of a facility, which provides a
safe, non-clinical, non-punitive, and therapeutic inpatient space, and respite
and stabilization beds, for temporary use by eligible adults in crisis and by
eligible adults whose crisis management and stabilization plan provides for the
occasional use of therapeutic space as a proactive means to prevent the onset
of a behavioral health crisis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  Within 180 days
after the effective date of this act, the Commissioner of Human Services shall
establish and implement a five-year pilot program to facilitate the coordinated
provision of START services to eligible adults in the State.  The dual purposes
of the pilot START program shall be to:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   utilize appropriate
crisis planning methods and the cross-system coordination of services as a
means to promote and enhance the health, wellbeing, and ongoing mental
stability of eligible adults residing at home in the community, in order to
enable eligible adults to avoid institutionalization and maintain
community-based residence; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   provide eligible adults
with a therapeutic space, within the community, which can be used both for
their respite, as a means to stave-off potential crisis, and for their
stabilization in times of actual crisis.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In implementing the
pilot START program, the commissioner shall: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
Commissioner of Human Services, within 180 days after the bills effective
date, to establish a five-year pilot program to facilitate the coordinated
provision of systemic, therapeutic, assessment, resource, and treatment (START)
services to eligible adults in the State.  An eligible adult is defined by
the bill as a person who has both a developmental disability and a mental
illness and is eligible to receive services from the Department of Human
Services (DHS).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The dual purposes of the pilot
program will be to:  1) utilize appropriate crisis planning methods and the
cross-system coordination of services as a means to promote and enhance the
health, wellbeing, and ongoing mental stability of eligible adults residing at
home in the community, in order to enable eligible adults to avoid
institutionalization and maintain community-based residence; and 2) provide
eligible adults with a therapeutic space, within the community, which can be
used both for their respite, as a means to stave-off potential crisis, and for
their stabilization in times of actual crisis.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In implementing the pilot
START program, the Commissioner of Human Services will be required to: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    develop effective
community, regional, and Statewide partnerships and efficient cross-system
service linkages, as may be necessary to ensure the timely and coordinated
provision of START services to all eligible adults in the State; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    ensure that the pilot
program utilizes a person-centered and solutions-focused approach, employs
positive psychology and other evidence-based practices, and prioritizes and
optimizes the independence, therapeutic treatment, and community-based living
of eligible adults, consistent with the START program model established in 1988
and promoted by the Center for START Services at the University of New
Hampshire Institute on Disability; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)    designate at least one
facility in each of the northern, central, and southern regions of the State to
serve as a therapeutic respite home under the pilot program.  Each therapeutic
respite home designated under the bill is to contain at least two respite beds
and two stabilization beds for use by eligible adults in the region.  Respite
beds are to be reserved for use by an eligible adult who is not in crisis, but
whose crisis management and stabilization plan provides for the occasional use
of therapeutic respite services as a means by which to prevent the onset of a
behavioral health crisis.  Stabilization beds are to be reserved for use by
eligible adults who are actively experiencing a behavioral health crisis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The pilot START program will
be designed to coordinate the cross-system provision of relevant services to
eligible adults.  Relevant services are to include, but need not be limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    individualized,
cross-system assessment and diagnostic services to be used in identifying
eligible adults and assessing and meeting their service needs;</p>

eligible adults, immediately upon request or referral, 24 hours per day, seven
days per week;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)    therapeutic respite and
stabilization care, which is to be provided in a therapeutic respite home to
any adult in crisis and to any eligible adult whose crisis management and
stabilization plan provides for the occasional and temporary use of therapeutic
respite as a means by which to prevent the onset of a behavioral health crisis;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4)    ongoing and
individualized cross-system crisis prevention and response planning services,
which are to be made available, upon request or referral, to eligible adults
and the family members, guardians, and caregivers thereof, and which are to
include, at a minimum, the development of a personalized crisis management and
stabilization plan for each eligible adult, which:  a) identifies strategies
that can be used by the eligible adult and the family members, guardian, or
caregivers thereof to proactively prevent a behavioral health crisis; and b)
describes the means and methods that will be used, in the event of a behavioral
health crisis, to facilitate the eligible adults timely receipt of appropriate

caregivers identify and make full use of all available START services; b)
promptly link eligible adults to, and coordinate each adults receipt of,
appropriate START services; and c) ensure the effective implementation of
crisis management and stabilization plans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
Commissioner of Human Services, at the end of each year of the pilot programs
operation, to submit a written report to the Governor and Legislature.  Each
annual report is to identify, at a minimum:  </p>
