STATEMENT This bill would require any candidate for State, county, or municipal elective public office to file with their nominating petition a specific affirmation that they are qualified to hold office, have not been convicted of any crime, and specifically have not been convicted of any disqualifying crime. Under current law, a candidate for Governor or Lieutenant Governor or the State Senate or General Assembly is required to annex to their nominating petition a statement signed by the candidate that they: (1)  have not been convicted of any offense graded by Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes as a crime of the first, second, third or fourth degree, or any offense in any other jurisdiction which, if committed in this State, would constitute such a crime; or (2) have been so convicted, in which case, the candidate is required to disclose on the statement the crime for which convicted, the date and place of the conviction and the penalties imposed for the conviction. Records expunged pursuant to chapter 52 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes are not subject to disclosure. Under current law, candidates for school board are also required to file with their nominating petition a specific affirmation that they are qualified for such office and have not been convicted of any disqualifying crime.  This bill would expand that requirement to include any candidate for State, county, or municipal elective public office.

STATEMENT This bill would require any candidate for State, county, or municipal elective public office to file with their nominating petition a specific affirmation that they are qualified to hold office, have not been convicted of any crime, and specifically have not been convicted of any disqualifying crime. Under current law, a candidate for Governor or Lieutenant Governor or the State Senate or General Assembly is required to annex to their nominating petition a statement signed by the candidate that they: (1)  have not been convicted of any offense graded by Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes as a crime of the first, second, third or fourth degree, or any offense in any other jurisdiction which, if committed in this State, would constitute such a crime; or (2) have been so convicted, in which case, the candidate is required to disclose on the statement the crime for which convicted, the date and place of the conviction and the penalties imposed for the conviction. Records expunged pursuant to chapter 52 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes are not subject to disclosure. Under current law, candidates for school board are also required to file with their nominating petition a specific affirmation that they are qualified for such office and have not been convicted of any disqualifying crime.  This bill would expand that requirement to include any candidate for State, county, or municipal elective public office.
