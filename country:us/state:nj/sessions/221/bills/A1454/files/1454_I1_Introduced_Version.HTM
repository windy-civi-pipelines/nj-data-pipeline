<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  R.S.19:13-8 is amended to
read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     19:13-8.  A candidate
nominated for an office in a petition shall manifest his acceptance of such
nomination by a written acceptance thereof, signed by his hand, upon or annexed
to such petition, to which shall be annexed the oath of allegiance prescribed
in section 41:1-1 of the Revised Statutes duly taken and subscribed by him
before an officer authorized to take oaths in this State, or if the same person
be named for the same office in more than one petition, annexed to one of such
petitions.  Such acceptance shall certify that the candidate is a resident of
and a legal voter in the jurisdiction of the office for which the nomination is
made <u>and that the candidate is qualified under the laws of this State to be
a candidate for the office mentioned in the petition</u>.  No candidate so
named shall sign such acceptance if he has signed an acceptance for the primary
nomination or any other petition of nomination under this chapter for such
office.  In addition, no candidate named in a petition for the office of member
of the House of Representatives shall sign an acceptance if the candidate has
signed an acceptance for the primary nomination or any other petition of
nomination for the office of member of the House of Representatives in another
congressional district in the same calendar year.</p>

acceptance of nomination for election to <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>the
office of Governor or the office of member of the Senate or General Assembly<b><span

any offense graded by Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes as a crime of the
first, second, third or fourth degree, or any offense in any other jurisdiction

the person has not been convicted of a disqualifying crime</u>; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. has been so convicted, in
which case, the candidate shall disclose on the statement the crime for which
convicted, the date and place of the conviction and the penalties imposed for
the conviction.  Such a candidate may, as an alternative, submit with the statement
a copy of an official document that provides such information.  If the
candidate has been convicted of more than one criminal offense, such
information about each conviction shall be provided.  Records expunged pursuant
to chapter 52 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes shall not be subject to
disclosure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the same person is
nominated for the same office in more than one petition, the statement shall be
annexed to one of such petitions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  R.S.19:13-20 is amended to
read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     19:13-20.  In the event of a
vacancy, howsoever caused, among candidates nominated at a primary election for
the general election, which vacancy shall occur not later than the 56th day
before the general election, or in the event of inability to select a candidate
because of a tie vote at such primary, a candidate shall be selected in the
following manner:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  (1)  In the case of an
office to be filled by the voters of the entire State, the candidate shall be
selected by the State committee of the political party wherein such vacancy has
occurred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In the case of an office
to be filled by the voters of a single and entire county, the candidate shall
be selected by the county committee in such county of the political party
wherein such vacancy has occurred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   In the case of an office
to be filled by the voters of a portion of the State comprising all or part of
two or more counties, the candidate shall be selected by those members of the
county committees of the party wherein the vacancy has occurred who represent
those portions of the respective counties which are comprised in the district
from which the candidate is to be elected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   In the case of an office
to be filled by the voters of a portion of a single county, the candidate shall
be selected by those members of the county committee of the party wherein the
vacancy has occurred who represent those portions of the county which are
comprised in the district from which the candidate is to be elected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At any meeting held for the selection
of a candidate under this subsection, a majority of the persons eligible to
vote thereat shall be required to be present for the conduct of any business,
and no person shall be entitled to vote at that meeting who is appointed to the
State committee or county committee after the seventh day preceding the date of
the meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 20 days after the
meeting of each county committee that is held on the first Tuesday following
the primary election at which committee members are elected, the municipal
clerk shall certify to the county clerk an official list of the duly elected
county committee members and an official list of the municipal committee
chairs.  The county party chairperson shall have a continuing duty to report to
the county clerk any vacancies, resignations, and committee positions filled
pursuant to R.S.19:5-2 or 19:5-3.  A report of a resignation shall be
accompanied by a notarized letter of resignation signed by the resigning
committee member or, if the resigning committee member fails to provide such a
letter, by a notarized letter stating that the resignation has occurred signed
by the chair of the relevant municipal committee who shall also provide a copy
thereof to the resigning member.  Notice of vacancies in the membership of a county
committee that are filled pursuant to R.S.19:5-2 or 19:5-3 shall be accompanied
by a certificate of acceptance signed by the newly selected member.  The
official list of the county committee members and of the municipal committee
chairs maintained by the county clerk shall be deemed to be a government record
and only those county committee members listed thereon seven days prior to a
selection to fill a vacancy and otherwise qualified to vote on the vacancy
shall be entitled to vote on filling a vacancy pursuant to this section.</p>
