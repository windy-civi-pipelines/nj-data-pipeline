SJR47 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION No. 47 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  ANDREW ZWICKER District 16 (Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset) SYNOPSIS Designates August of each year as Radon Awareness Month; designates August 2 of each year as Radon Action Day. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Joint Resolution designating August of each year as Radon Awareness Month and August 2 of each year as Radon Action Day. Whereas, Radon is an invisible, odorless, radioactive gas occurring naturally throughout the United States from the deterioration of uranium in the Earths crust; and Whereas, Radon, a known carcinogen, is the second leading cause of lung cancer, taking over 21,000 lives each year; and Whereas, Prolonged exposure to elevated levels of radon greatly increase the risk of an individual developing lung cancer; and Whereas, Radon levels fluctuate in response to weather, temperature, and other factors; and Whereas, Radon rises into indoor air through dirt floors, foundation cracks, loose pipefittings, sump pumps and other structural gaps; and Whereas, The United States Environmental Protection Agency asserts that one of every 15 homes has high levels of radon; and Whereas, A 2015 radon potential map created by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) places the majority of the State at moderate to high risk of elevated radon exposure; and Whereas, Elevated levels of radon have also been found in New Jersey homes in areas categorized as being of low risk to excessive exposure; and Whereas, It is recommended by the DEP that a home be tested for radon by a person certified as a radon tester by the DEP prior to sale; and Whereas, The United States Surgeon General recommends testing the radon level for a dwelling every two years, whenever a structural change is made, and whenever there is a newly occupied area of an existing dwelling; and Whereas, Mitigation of exposure is immediate upon venting and sealing the foundation, and can be performed by an experienced home repairer or a professional certified by the DEP; and Whereas, Radon level testing, radon exposure mitigation, and radon resistant construction are available to New Jerseyans to hinder lifelong exposure; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    In order to create awareness of the silent threat of elevated levels of radon exposure in indoor air, and to encourage regular testing and remediation of elevated levels of radon within a dwelling or occupied structure in this State: a.     The month of August each year is designated as Radon Awareness Month in New Jersey. b.    August 2 of each year is designated as Radon Action Day in New Jersey. 2.    The Governor may annually issue a proclamation calling upon public officials and the residents of the State to observe Radon Awareness Month and Radon Action Day with appropriate activities and programs. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution recognizes the risk of long term exposure to elevated levels of radon in contaminated indoor air. Radon is an odorless and colorless radioactive gas released from the Earth by the natural breakdown of uranium. Radon is a known carcinogen, killing over 21,000 Americans each year.  It seeps upward into the air from exposed ground, through foundation cracks and other structural gaps. Radon levels fluctuate based on temperature, weather and other factors. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection classifies the majority of the State as having moderate to high risk potential for elevated levels of radon exposure.  The U.S. Surgeon General recommends that a home be tested every other year, upon sale, whenever a structural change is made, and in newly occupied areas.  Radon testing is simple and can be performed by certified professionals. Mitigation of exposure is immediate upon venting and sealing the foundation and any structural gaps. This resolution recognizes the importance of testing indoor air for elevated levels of radon, and the importance of remediation in New Jersey through a campaign of awareness each month of August, and a day of action each August 2.
