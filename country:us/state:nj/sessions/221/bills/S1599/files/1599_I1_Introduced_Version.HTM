Further, the bill requires health insurance carriers, including insurance companies, health service corporations, hospital service corporations, medical service corporations, health maintenance organizations authorized to issue health benefits plans in New Jersey, and any entity contracted to administer health benefits in connection with the State Health Benefits Program or School Employees Health Benefits Program, to cover home care. The provisions of the bill are not be interpreted as imposing any new network adequacy requirements related specifically to the provision of home care.
