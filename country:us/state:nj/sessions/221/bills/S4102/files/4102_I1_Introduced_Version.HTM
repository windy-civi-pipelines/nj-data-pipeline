STATEMENT This bill would amend and supplement the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), to allocate $7.5 million annually of constitutionally dedicated Corporation Business Tax (CBT) revenue to the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council (council) for the preservation of land in the Highlands Region. The funding in this bill is provided from constitutionally dedicated CBT revenues pursuant to Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution, which dedicates six percent of the CBT for certain environmental purposes.  Under the Preserve New Jersey Act (act), P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), of the dedicated CBT revenues allocated for open space, farmland, and historic preservation, each year:  62 percent is allocated to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for recreation and conservation purposes; 31 percent is allocated to the State Agriculture Development Committee (SADC) for farmland preservation; and the remaining seven percent is allocated to the New Jersey Historic Trust for historic preservation. Under this bill, $5 million of the amount allocated each year to the DEP and $2.5 million of the amount allocated to the SADC would be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Highlands Preservation Fund, a new fund created by the bill.  These moneys, totaling $7.5 million each year would be used by the council to preserve lands located in the Highlands Region.
