In the event that the average cost per license plate as certified by the chief administrator and approved by the Joint Budget Oversight Committee, or its successor, is greater than the $50 application fee established pursuant to subsection b. of this section in two consecutive fiscal years, the chief administrator may discontinue the issuance of the New Jersey 4-H license plates. e.     The chief administrator shall notify eligible motorists of the opportunity to obtain the New Jersey 4-H license plates by publicizing the availability of the license plates on the commissions Internet website.  New Jersey 4-H, and any other individual or entity designated by New Jersey 4-H, may publicize the availability of the New Jersey 4-H license plates in any manner that New Jersey 4-H deems appropriate. f.     The chief administrator and New Jersey 4-H shall develop and enter into a memorandum of agreement setting forth the procedures to be followed in carrying out their respective responsibilities under P.L.    , c.

(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    An individual or entity designated by New Jersey 4-H shall contribute non-public monies in an amount to be determined by the chief administrator, not to exceed a total of $25,000, to be used to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission for designing, producing, issuing, and publicizing the availability of the New Jersey 4-H license plates and for any computer programming that may be necessary to implement the program.  Concerned organizations and individual donors may contribute monies to New Jersey 4-H to be used to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission for the New Jersey 4-H license plates authorized by P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Any amount remaining after the payment of the initial cost shall be deposited in the New Jersey 4-H License Plate Fund established pursuant to subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     The commission shall not begin designing, producing, issuing, or publicizing the availability of New Jersey 4-H license plates, or making any necessary programming changes, until the following requirements have been met: (1)   an individual or entity designated by New Jersey 4-H has provided the commission with the non-public monies necessary, as determined by the chief administrator pursuant to subsection b. of this section, to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission in establishing the New Jersey 4-H license plate program; and (2)   the liaison appointed by New Jersey 4-H pursuant to subsection g. of section 1 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) has provided the commission with not less than 500 completed applications for New Jersey 4-H license plates.  These applications shall constitute the initial order for New Jersey 4-H license plates and shall be accompanied by a fee representing the total cost of the initial order.  The fee shall be determined by multiplying the number of sets of license plates being ordered by the applicable initial fee for each set of license plates as set forth in subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 3.    This act shall take effect immediately but shall remain inoperative until the first day of the seventh month following the date on which the conditions set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection c. of section 2 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) have been satisfied.  The chief administrator may take anticipatory acts in advance of that date as may be necessary for the timely implementation of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  This act shall expire if the conditions set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection c. of section 2 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) are not satisfied by the last day of the 12th month following enactment. STATEMENT This bill authorizes the Chief Administrator (chief administrator) of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (commission) to issue special New Jersey 4-H license plates. The bill provides that the design of the New Jersey 4-H license plate is to display appropriate words or a slogan and an emblem honoring New Jersey 4-H.  The chief administrator, in consultation with New Jersey 4-H, is to select the design and color scheme of the New Jersey 4-H license plates. In addition to all fees otherwise required by law for the registration of a motor vehicle, there is an application fee of $50 and an annual renewal fee of $10 for the New Jersey 4-H license plates.  After deducting the costs to implement the plates, the additional fees are to be deposited into a special non-lapsing fund known as the New Jersey 4-H License Plate Fund.  The proceeds of the fund are to be annually appropriated to New Jersey 4-H to support the organizations mission and programs. The chief administrator is required to annually certify the average cost of producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the availability of the specialty license plates.  If the average cost per plate exceeds $50 in two consecutive fiscal years, the chief administrator may discontinue the New Jersey 4-H license plate program.  The bill also requires New Jersey 4-H to appoint a liaison to represent the organization in all communications with the commission regarding the New Jersey 4-H license plates. The bill provides that State or other public funds are not to be used by the commission for the initial cost to implement the license plate program.  The bill requires New Jersey 4-H, or an individual or entity designated by the organization, to contribute non-public monies, not to exceed $25,000, to offset the initial costs to design, produce, issue, and publicize the license plates and for computer programming changes that may be necessary to implement the program.  The bill authorizes New Jersey 4-H to receive funds from private sources to offset the initial costs. The commission is not required to design, produce, issue, or publicize the availability of the New Jersey 4-H license plates until:  (1) New Jersey 4-H, or the individual or entity designated by the organization, has provided the commission with the monies necessary to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission in establishing the license plate program; and (2) the New Jersey 4-H liaison has provided the commission with a minimum of 500 completed applications for the license plates. The provisions of the bill will remain inoperative until the first day of the seventh month after the appropriate applications and fees required to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission are provided to the commission.  The bill expires on the last day of the 12th month if sufficient applications and fees to offset the initial costs are not received by that date.
