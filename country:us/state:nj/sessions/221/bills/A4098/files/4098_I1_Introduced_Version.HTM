(cf: P.L.2022, c.38, s.1) 5.    Section 6 of P.L.2006, c.3 (C.27:1B-22.2) is amended to read as follows: 6.    There is hereby created in the Executive Branch of the State Government, a body corporate and politic, with corporate succession, to be known as the Transportation Policy Review Board. For the purpose of complying with the provisions of Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, the board is hereby allocated within the Department of Transportation, but, notwithstanding that allocation, the board shall be independent of any supervision or control by the department or by any body or officer thereof. The board is hereby constituted as an instrumentality of the State exercising public and essential governmental functions, and the exercise by the board of the powers conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the State. The board shall be comprised of nine public members with experience in transportation finance and policy. The Governor shall appoint three of the members with the advice and consent of the Senate, two of whom shall be experts that perform academic research in the areas of transportation and public transportation policy, planning, or engineering, and one of whom shall be an expert in the area of transportation capital finance. The remaining members shall be appointed by the Governor as follows: two upon the recommendation of the President of the Senate, one upon the recommendation of the Minority Leader of the Senate, two upon the recommendation of the Speaker of the General Assembly, and one upon the recommendation of the Minority Leader of the General Assembly. Each member shall have a professional background in passenger rail service, freight rail management, transportation capital planning, transportation and public transportation capital construction, federal transportation policy, State transportation policy, or transportation capital finance. Each member shall serve for a four-year term and shall serve until the member's successor is appointed and qualified; provided, however, that in order to achieve non-concurrent terms, of the members first appointed pursuant to this section, two members appointed by the Governor shall serve for four years; while the three members appointed upon the recommendations of the President of the Senate and the Minority Leader of the Senate and the three members appointed upon the recommendations of the Speaker of the General Assembly and the Minority Leader of the General Assembly shall serve for three years each, and the remaining member appointed by the Governor shall serve for two years; and further provided that any member serving on the effective date of P.L.2016, c.56 (C.27:1B-22.5 et al.) shall serve until the expiration of that member's term, notwithstanding the criteria for appointment established pursuant to P.L.2016, c.56 (C.27:1B-22.5 et al.). The Transportation Policy Review Board shall be deemed to be constituted immediately upon appointment and qualification in the manner provided in this section of at least five members. The purpose of the board is to assure fiscal discipline through evaluating the financing of transportation; independently analyzing and reporting on the cost effectiveness of spending in the transportation capital program; conducting and commissioning research on best practices in the areas of transportation and public transportation construction, planning, finance, and engineering; providing policy recommendations to the Legislature on the best ways to organize the capital program and appropriate capital program funds; and preparing an annual State of Condition of Transportation Financing certification. The board shall annually appear before the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, or its successor, and the Assembly Budget Committee, or its successor, and provide independent analysis of the transportation capital program, provide comments on the cost effectiveness of the program, evaluate the condition of the State transportation system, and identify needed infrastructure investments. The board shall annually appear before the Senate Transportation Committee, or its successor, and the Assembly Transportation and Independent Authorities Committee, or its successor, and report on best practices and cost savings in areas related to transportation and public transportation construction, planning, finance, infrastructure, and governance. The board shall also make itself available to the aforementioned budget and transportation committees to conduct research and provide recommendations on policy issues that those committees request of the board. The board shall issue an annual report on or before June 1 of each year which summarizes the work of the board for the prior year, evaluates the reports issued by the department pursuant to section 22 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-22), and provides independent recommendations for administering the annual capital program. The board shall be provided with a budget each year to be funded through the capital program, and the budget shall be sufficient to allow the board to commission independent research from academic and other experts in the area of research to be conducted, to avail itself of any professional or consultant services necessary to perform its functions, and to complete the reports and certifications required pursuant to this section. The board may call to its assistance and avail itself of the services of the employees of any State, county, or municipal department, board, bureau, task force, or agency as it may require and as may be available to it for its purposes, and to employ stenographic and clerical assistance and incur traveling and other miscellaneous expenses necessary to perform its duties, within the limits of funds appropriated or otherwise made available to it for its purposes. The board shall submit reports to the Governor, and to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1) no later than April 1, 2017 concerning the taxation of motor vehicles that are powered by a fuel source that is not subject to the motor fuels tax pursuant to P.L.2010, c.22 (C.54:39-101 et seq.) or the petroleum products gross receipts tax pursuant to P.L.1990, c.42 (C.54:15B-1 et seq.), including, but not limited to electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The report required pursuant to this subsection shall include recommendations to the Legislature for a new system of taxation that mandates that all vehicles operating on the highways of this State contribute equitably to the cost of maintaining the State transportation system. The State of Condition of Transportation Financing certification shall ensure that the financing and expenditures of the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority (the "authority") adhere to certain standards. The standards are: a. The bonding limitation as provided in subsection i. of section 9 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-9). b. For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2007, the amount expended from the revenues and other funds of the authority for permitted maintenance shall not exceed the amount expended for permitted maintenance in the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2006. c. The total amount authorized to be appropriated from the revenues and other funds of the authority for project costs commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007 through the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015 shall not exceed $1,600,000,000 annually, and for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2016 through the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2023 shall not exceed an aggregate $16,000,000,000 over that eight-year period, and for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2024 through the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2031 shall not exceed an aggregate $15,960,000,000 over that eight-year period. Commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007, the board shall submit to the Governor, the Legislature, and the commissioner on an annual basis the State of Condition of Transportation Financing certification as to the requirements of certification standard a. referencing therein a certification with regard to certification standards b. and c. to the extent feasible, given the other provisions of this section. The certifications shall be based on the board's review of the State's fiscal year final expenditures from the preceding fiscal year, including bonding and expenditures from the annual independent audit of the authority, and the amount of authority funds programmed for permitted maintenance. If the capital program and its financing are found to be in compliance, the first annual certification required by this paragraph shall be submitted by February 1, 2008, after the certification is concurred with by the members of the authority, and by February 1 of each year thereafter. The board shall advise the commissioner and the authority on February 1, 2008 and on each succeeding February 1, if the board finds that the authority is not in compliance with the bonding requirements as provided in certification standard a. of the section, and that a corrective action plan is needed. The authority shall submit a corrective action plan that would reduce its future bond sales to offset the amount of excess bonding or to reduce future debt service payments, or both, as the case may be. Upon approval of the corrective action plan by the board, the certification shall be issued with certain conditions. The Annual Transportation Capital Program submitted to the Legislature for the forthcoming year shall be in compliance with the provisions of the corrective action plan. If the board does not approve the corrective action plan, the authority shall submit a financial plan showing bonding only for existing projects, noting that no bonds shall be issued for new projects shown in the department's Annual Transportation Capital Program. The board shall advise the commissioner on February 1, 2008 and on each succeeding February 1, if the board finds that the Department of Transportation has exceeded the limitation for the amount of authority funds spent on permitted maintenance pursuant to certification standard b. of this section, or for the amount authorized to be appropriated for project costs pursuant to certification standard c. of this section and that a corrective action plan is needed. The department shall submit a corrective action plan that would offset the excess amount spent, or the excess amount appropriated, in the prior year with less funding for permitted maintenance or for projects, as the case may be, in the proposed capital budget request. Upon approval of the corrective action plan by the board, a certification as to these matters shall be issued with certain conditions. The Annual Transportation Capital Program submitted to the Legislature for the forthcoming year shall be in compliance with the provisions of the corrective action plan. If the board does not approve the corrective action plan, the authority shall submit a financial plan showing bonding only for existing projects, noting that no bonds shall be issued for new projects shown in the department's Annual Transportation Capital Program.

(h)  On and after the 10th day following a certification by the review council pursuant to subsection c. of section 19 of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.52:18A-257), no tax shall be imposed pursuant to this paragraph. (2)  (a)  In addition to the tax, if any, imposed by paragraph (1) of this subsection, a cents-per-gallon tax is imposed on each company's gross receipts derived from the first sale of petroleum products within this State on gasoline, blended fuel that contains gasoline or that is intended for use as gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas, and aviation fuel at the rate of four cents per gallon; and (b)   In addition to the tax, if any, imposed by paragraph (1) of this subsection, a cents-per-gallon tax is imposed on each company's gross receipts derived from the first sale of petroleum products within this State on diesel fuel, blended fuel that contains diesel fuel or is intended for use as diesel fuel, and kerosene, other than aviation grade kerosene, at the rate of four cents per gallon before July 1, 2017 and at the rate of eight cents per gallon on and after July 1, 2017. b.    There is imposed on each company that imports or causes to be imported, other than by a company subject to and having paid the tax on those imported petroleum products that have generated gross receipts taxable under subsection a. of this section, petroleum products for use or consumption by it within this State a tax at the rate or rates, determined pursuant to subsection a. of this section, on the consideration given or contracted to be given and the gallonage for such petroleum products if the consideration given or contracted to be given for all such deliveries made during a quarterly period exceeds $5,000. c. (1) For State fiscal years 2018 through [2026] 2032, the rate of tax imposed on highway fuel pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall be adjusted annually so that the total revenue derived from highway fuel shall not exceed the highway fuel cap amount. (2)   The State Treasurer shall, on or before December 31, 2016, determine the highway fuel cap amount as the sum of: (a)   the taxes collected for State Fiscal Year 2016 pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2010, c.22 (C.54:39-103) on highway fuel, (b)   the amount derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to motor fuel tax in State Fiscal Year 2016 at the rate of four cents per gallon, and (c)   the amount that would have been derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to motor fuel tax in State Fiscal Year 2016 at the rate of 23 cents per gallon.

(5)   If the actual revenue determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection exceeds the highway fuel cap amount determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the highway fuel cap amount for the succeeding year shall be decreased by the amount of the excess in setting the rate pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection.  If the actual revenue determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection is less than the highway fuel cap amount determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the highway fuel cap amount for the succeeding year shall be increased by the amount of the shortfall in setting the rate pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection. (cf: P.L.2016, c.57 s.14) 7.    Section 7 of P.L.2015, c.24 (C.54:32B-8.55a) is amended to read as follows: 7.    Before March 1 annually, all motor vehicle franchisors and motor vehicle franchisees in the State, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1985, c.361 (C.56:10-26), shall report to the Division of Taxation the number of [zero emission] electric vehicles sold in the State each calendar year and [exempt] the amounts remitted from the tax imposed under the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) [pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2003, c.266 (C.54:32B-8.55)] on such vehicles. (cf: P.L.2015, c.24, s.7) 8.    (New section) a. Beginning on July 1, 2024 and thereafter, in addition to the registration fees imposed pursuant to Article 2 of chapter 3 of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee, as follows, on each electric vehicle to be registered: (1)   $300 for each passenger electric vehicle; and (2)   $450 for each commercial electric vehicle. b.    The fee established pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall accrue and shall be collectible upon each electric vehicle under the same circumstances and shall be payable in the same manner and times as apply to vehicle registrations under the provisions of Article 2 of chapter 3 of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes, except that the fee shall be paid in full for the then current year at the time any electric vehicle is first registered in a calendar year. c.     Fees collected pursuant to this section shall be credited to the "Transportation Trust Fund Account," established pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-20), in accordance with the provisions of subsection f. of section 20 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-20). d.    As used in this section: Commercial electric vehicle means any electric vehicle that is operated in interstate or intrastate commerce and used for the transportation of persons for hire, compensation or profit, or designed or used primarily for the transportation of property. Electric vehicle means any motor vehicle that is propelled solely by an electric motor or energy storage device, which electric motor or energy storage device can be charged from an electricity supply external to the vehicle. Passenger electric vehicle means any electric vehicle that is not a commercial electric vehicle. 9.    a.  There is appropriated from the General Fund to the New Jersey Transit Corporation the sum of $1,000,000,000, which shall be allocated in the following amounts for the following purposes, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting:  (1) $760,000,000 shall be for the financing of capital projects, and (2) $240,000,000 shall be for the corporations operating expenses. b.    The annual appropriations act for State Fiscal Year 2026 shall include an appropriation from the General Fund to the New Jersey Transit Corporation in the sum of $1,000,000,000, which shall be allocated in the following amounts for the following purposes, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting:  (1) $760,000,000 shall be for the financing of capital projects, and (2) $240,000,000 shall be for the corporations operating expenses. 10.  There is appropriated from the New Jersey Debt Defeasance and Prevention Fund the sum of $1,500,000,000 to the Transportation Trust Fund Account - Subaccount for Capital Reserves to be used for the funding of transportation capital projects on a pay-as-you-go basis, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting.  No funds appropriated pursuant to this section shall be expended for the payment of debt service on transportation system bonds, transportation program bonds, or any other bonds, notes or other obligations, including subordinated obligations of the authority. 11.  Section 11 of P.L.2003, c.266 (C.54:32B-8.55) is repealed. 12.  This act shall take effect immediately, provided that section 11 shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment and shall apply to all sales occurring on or after such date. STATEMENT This bill amends the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority Act of 1984 to make changes necessary to support the States Annual Transportation Capital Program (capital program) for Fiscal Years (FY) 2025 through 2032.  These changes also (1) extend the process for calculating the rate of tax imposed on highway fuels under the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax (PPGRT) through Fiscal Year 2032; (2) impose an additional registration fee for electric vehicles; (3) appropriate funds to the New Jersey Transit Corporation; (4) appropriate funds from the Debt Defeasance and Prevention Fund to the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF); and (5) repeal the sales and use tax exemption for zero emission vehicles. Transportation Trust Fund Authority Renewal This bill extends the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authoritys (authority) existing authorization to issue transportation program bonds and creates the potential to increase the authoritys bonding authorization from FY 2029 through FY 2032.  Under current law, the authority is authorized to issue such transportation program bonds as are necessary to fund the capital program, in an amount not to exceed $12 billion, through June 30, 2024.  The bill extends this authorization through June 30, 2032.  The bill requires the authority, on or before June 30, 2028, to assess whether its remaining bonding capacity is sufficient to fund the capital program through FY 2032 and report its findings to the Legislature and Governor.  If the authority determines that additional authorization is needed to fund the capital program, the Legislature and Governor may authorize the authority to issue a maximum of $4 billion in transportation program bonds from FY 2029 through FY 2032. This bill authorizes $15.96 billion in capital program expenditures for an eight-year period from FY 2025 through FY 2032.  Specifically, this bill allows for an average annual capital program size of $2 billion from FY 2025 through FY 2032.  The bill requires $500 million to be annually appropriated to the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ Transit) for capital projects during FY 2027 through FY 2032.  However, under the bill, no monies are to be appropriated in the capital program to NJ Transit for these purposes in FY 2025 and FY 2026. Extension of PPGRT Rate Adjustment Procedure Until 2032 This bill extends the PPGRT annual rate adjustment procedure through FY 2032. Under current law, the rate of tax imposed under the PPGRT is annually adjusted by the State Treasurer to ensure that the State realizes a statutorily prescribed revenue target, more commonly referred to as the highway fuel cap, based on 2016 collections of highway fuel taxes.  The cap amount is based on the Fiscal Year 2016 sum of: (1) the taxes collected under the Motor Fuel Tax, (2) the amount derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to the four cent motor fuel tax, and (3) the amount that would have been derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to the motor fuel tax at a rate of 23 cents per gallon. All revenues collected are deposited into the TTF to support transportation infrastructure projects and debt service on transportation bonds.  This annual adjustment mechanism is currently set to expire at the conclusion of FY 2026. The bill allows this process to continue through FY 2032. Additional Vehicle Registration Fee for Electric Vehicles The bill imposes an additional registration fee for electric vehicles registered in the State.  The fee would be collected by the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission at the same time the vehicle is initially registered or renewed, as the case may be. Beginning on July 1, 2024, the amount of the fee would be $300 for passenger electric vehicles and $450 for commercial electric vehicles. Under the bill, the revenues generated from these fees would be credited to the Transportation Trust Fund Account - Subaccount for Capital Reserves to support transportation projects. However, the bill specifies that these collections may not be used to pay debt service on transportation system bonds, transportation program bonds, or any other bonds, notes or other obligations, including subordinated obligations of the authority until such time as these revenues may be constitutionally dedicated to the TTF. Appropriation of Funds to New Jersey Transit The bill makes a supplemental appropriation of $1 billion from the General Fund to NJ Transit.  The bill requires $760 million of these funds to be used for the financing of capital projects and $240 million to be used for NJ Transit operating expenses.  The bill also requires the State to appropriate an additional $1 billion in FY 2026 for those same purposes. Appropriation of Funds from Debt Defeasance and Prevention Fund to TTF The bill appropriates $1.5 billion from the New Jersey Debt Defeasance and Prevention Fund to the Transportation Trust Fund Account - Subaccount for Capital Reserves to be used for the funding of transportation capital projects on a pay-as-you-go basis.  The bill prohibits the expenditure of these funds for debt service on transportation system bonds, transportation program bonds, or any other bonds, notes, or other obligations, including subordinated obligations of the TTF. Repeal of Sales Tax Exemption for Electric Vehicles The bill repeals the sales and use tax exemption currently provided for the sales of zero emission vehicles and annually dedicates the revenues derived from the sales of these vehicles, up to $100 million, to the TTF.  Specifically, these revenues would be credited to the Transportation Trust Fund Account - Subaccount for Capital Reserves to be used for transportation projects.  The bill also specifies that these collections may not be used to pay debt service on transportation system bonds, transportation program bonds, or any other bonds, notes, or other obligations, including subordinated obligations of the authority, until such time as these revenues may be constitutionally dedicated to the TTF.

(cf: P.L.2022, c.38, s.1) 5.    Section 6 of P.L.2006, c.3 (C.27:1B-22.2) is amended to read as follows: 6.    There is hereby created in the Executive Branch of the State Government, a body corporate and politic, with corporate succession, to be known as the Transportation Policy Review Board. For the purpose of complying with the provisions of Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, the board is hereby allocated within the Department of Transportation, but, notwithstanding that allocation, the board shall be independent of any supervision or control by the department or by any body or officer thereof. The board is hereby constituted as an instrumentality of the State exercising public and essential governmental functions, and the exercise by the board of the powers conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the State. The board shall be comprised of nine public members with experience in transportation finance and policy. The Governor shall appoint three of the members with the advice and consent of the Senate, two of whom shall be experts that perform academic research in the areas of transportation and public transportation policy, planning, or engineering, and one of whom shall be an expert in the area of transportation capital finance. The remaining members shall be appointed by the Governor as follows: two upon the recommendation of the President of the Senate, one upon the recommendation of the Minority Leader of the Senate, two upon the recommendation of the Speaker of the General Assembly, and one upon the recommendation of the Minority Leader of the General Assembly. Each member shall have a professional background in passenger rail service, freight rail management, transportation capital planning, transportation and public transportation capital construction, federal transportation policy, State transportation policy, or transportation capital finance. Each member shall serve for a four-year term and shall serve until the member's successor is appointed and qualified; provided, however, that in order to achieve non-concurrent terms, of the members first appointed pursuant to this section, two members appointed by the Governor shall serve for four years; while the three members appointed upon the recommendations of the President of the Senate and the Minority Leader of the Senate and the three members appointed upon the recommendations of the Speaker of the General Assembly and the Minority Leader of the General Assembly shall serve for three years each, and the remaining member appointed by the Governor shall serve for two years; and further provided that any member serving on the effective date of P.L.2016, c.56 (C.27:1B-22.5 et al.) shall serve until the expiration of that member's term, notwithstanding the criteria for appointment established pursuant to P.L.2016, c.56 (C.27:1B-22.5 et al.). The Transportation Policy Review Board shall be deemed to be constituted immediately upon appointment and qualification in the manner provided in this section of at least five members. The purpose of the board is to assure fiscal discipline through evaluating the financing of transportation; independently analyzing and reporting on the cost effectiveness of spending in the transportation capital program; conducting and commissioning research on best practices in the areas of transportation and public transportation construction, planning, finance, and engineering; providing policy recommendations to the Legislature on the best ways to organize the capital program and appropriate capital program funds; and preparing an annual State of Condition of Transportation Financing certification. The board shall annually appear before the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, or its successor, and the Assembly Budget Committee, or its successor, and provide independent analysis of the transportation capital program, provide comments on the cost effectiveness of the program, evaluate the condition of the State transportation system, and identify needed infrastructure investments. The board shall annually appear before the Senate Transportation Committee, or its successor, and the Assembly Transportation and Independent Authorities Committee, or its successor, and report on best practices and cost savings in areas related to transportation and public transportation construction, planning, finance, infrastructure, and governance. The board shall also make itself available to the aforementioned budget and transportation committees to conduct research and provide recommendations on policy issues that those committees request of the board. The board shall issue an annual report on or before June 1 of each year which summarizes the work of the board for the prior year, evaluates the reports issued by the department pursuant to section 22 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-22), and provides independent recommendations for administering the annual capital program. The board shall be provided with a budget each year to be funded through the capital program, and the budget shall be sufficient to allow the board to commission independent research from academic and other experts in the area of research to be conducted, to avail itself of any professional or consultant services necessary to perform its functions, and to complete the reports and certifications required pursuant to this section. The board may call to its assistance and avail itself of the services of the employees of any State, county, or municipal department, board, bureau, task force, or agency as it may require and as may be available to it for its purposes, and to employ stenographic and clerical assistance and incur traveling and other miscellaneous expenses necessary to perform its duties, within the limits of funds appropriated or otherwise made available to it for its purposes. The board shall submit reports to the Governor, and to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1) no later than April 1, 2017 concerning the taxation of motor vehicles that are powered by a fuel source that is not subject to the motor fuels tax pursuant to P.L.2010, c.22 (C.54:39-101 et seq.) or the petroleum products gross receipts tax pursuant to P.L.1990, c.42 (C.54:15B-1 et seq.), including, but not limited to electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The report required pursuant to this subsection shall include recommendations to the Legislature for a new system of taxation that mandates that all vehicles operating on the highways of this State contribute equitably to the cost of maintaining the State transportation system. The State of Condition of Transportation Financing certification shall ensure that the financing and expenditures of the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority (the "authority") adhere to certain standards. The standards are: a. The bonding limitation as provided in subsection i. of section 9 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-9). b. For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2007, the amount expended from the revenues and other funds of the authority for permitted maintenance shall not exceed the amount expended for permitted maintenance in the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2006. c. The total amount authorized to be appropriated from the revenues and other funds of the authority for project costs commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007 through the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015 shall not exceed $1,600,000,000 annually, and for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2016 through the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2023 shall not exceed an aggregate $16,000,000,000 over that eight-year period, and for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2024 through the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2031 shall not exceed an aggregate $15,960,000,000 over that eight-year period. Commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007, the board shall submit to the Governor, the Legislature, and the commissioner on an annual basis the State of Condition of Transportation Financing certification as to the requirements of certification standard a. referencing therein a certification with regard to certification standards b. and c. to the extent feasible, given the other provisions of this section. The certifications shall be based on the board's review of the State's fiscal year final expenditures from the preceding fiscal year, including bonding and expenditures from the annual independent audit of the authority, and the amount of authority funds programmed for permitted maintenance. If the capital program and its financing are found to be in compliance, the first annual certification required by this paragraph shall be submitted by February 1, 2008, after the certification is concurred with by the members of the authority, and by February 1 of each year thereafter. The board shall advise the commissioner and the authority on February 1, 2008 and on each succeeding February 1, if the board finds that the authority is not in compliance with the bonding requirements as provided in certification standard a. of the section, and that a corrective action plan is needed. The authority shall submit a corrective action plan that would reduce its future bond sales to offset the amount of excess bonding or to reduce future debt service payments, or both, as the case may be. Upon approval of the corrective action plan by the board, the certification shall be issued with certain conditions. The Annual Transportation Capital Program submitted to the Legislature for the forthcoming year shall be in compliance with the provisions of the corrective action plan. If the board does not approve the corrective action plan, the authority shall submit a financial plan showing bonding only for existing projects, noting that no bonds shall be issued for new projects shown in the department's Annual Transportation Capital Program. The board shall advise the commissioner on February 1, 2008 and on each succeeding February 1, if the board finds that the Department of Transportation has exceeded the limitation for the amount of authority funds spent on permitted maintenance pursuant to certification standard b. of this section, or for the amount authorized to be appropriated for project costs pursuant to certification standard c. of this section and that a corrective action plan is needed. The department shall submit a corrective action plan that would offset the excess amount spent, or the excess amount appropriated, in the prior year with less funding for permitted maintenance or for projects, as the case may be, in the proposed capital budget request. Upon approval of the corrective action plan by the board, a certification as to these matters shall be issued with certain conditions. The Annual Transportation Capital Program submitted to the Legislature for the forthcoming year shall be in compliance with the provisions of the corrective action plan. If the board does not approve the corrective action plan, the authority shall submit a financial plan showing bonding only for existing projects, noting that no bonds shall be issued for new projects shown in the department's Annual Transportation Capital Program.

(h)  On and after the 10th day following a certification by the review council pursuant to subsection c. of section 19 of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.52:18A-257), no tax shall be imposed pursuant to this paragraph. (2)  (a)  In addition to the tax, if any, imposed by paragraph (1) of this subsection, a cents-per-gallon tax is imposed on each company's gross receipts derived from the first sale of petroleum products within this State on gasoline, blended fuel that contains gasoline or that is intended for use as gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas, and aviation fuel at the rate of four cents per gallon; and (b)   In addition to the tax, if any, imposed by paragraph (1) of this subsection, a cents-per-gallon tax is imposed on each company's gross receipts derived from the first sale of petroleum products within this State on diesel fuel, blended fuel that contains diesel fuel or is intended for use as diesel fuel, and kerosene, other than aviation grade kerosene, at the rate of four cents per gallon before July 1, 2017 and at the rate of eight cents per gallon on and after July 1, 2017. b.    There is imposed on each company that imports or causes to be imported, other than by a company subject to and having paid the tax on those imported petroleum products that have generated gross receipts taxable under subsection a. of this section, petroleum products for use or consumption by it within this State a tax at the rate or rates, determined pursuant to subsection a. of this section, on the consideration given or contracted to be given and the gallonage for such petroleum products if the consideration given or contracted to be given for all such deliveries made during a quarterly period exceeds $5,000. c. (1) For State fiscal years 2018 through [2026] 2032, the rate of tax imposed on highway fuel pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall be adjusted annually so that the total revenue derived from highway fuel shall not exceed the highway fuel cap amount. (2)   The State Treasurer shall, on or before December 31, 2016, determine the highway fuel cap amount as the sum of: (a)   the taxes collected for State Fiscal Year 2016 pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2010, c.22 (C.54:39-103) on highway fuel, (b)   the amount derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to motor fuel tax in State Fiscal Year 2016 at the rate of four cents per gallon, and (c)   the amount that would have been derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to motor fuel tax in State Fiscal Year 2016 at the rate of 23 cents per gallon.

(5)   If the actual revenue determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection exceeds the highway fuel cap amount determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the highway fuel cap amount for the succeeding year shall be decreased by the amount of the excess in setting the rate pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection.  If the actual revenue determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection is less than the highway fuel cap amount determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the highway fuel cap amount for the succeeding year shall be increased by the amount of the shortfall in setting the rate pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection. (cf: P.L.2016, c.57 s.14) 7.    Section 7 of P.L.2015, c.24 (C.54:32B-8.55a) is amended to read as follows: 7.    Before March 1 annually, all motor vehicle franchisors and motor vehicle franchisees in the State, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1985, c.361 (C.56:10-26), shall report to the Division of Taxation the number of [zero emission] electric vehicles sold in the State each calendar year and [exempt] the amounts remitted from the tax imposed under the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) [pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2003, c.266 (C.54:32B-8.55)] on such vehicles. (cf: P.L.2015, c.24, s.7) 8.    (New section) a. Beginning on July 1, 2024 and thereafter, in addition to the registration fees imposed pursuant to Article 2 of chapter 3 of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee, as follows, on each electric vehicle to be registered: (1)   $300 for each passenger electric vehicle; and (2)   $450 for each commercial electric vehicle. b.    The fee established pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall accrue and shall be collectible upon each electric vehicle under the same circumstances and shall be payable in the same manner and times as apply to vehicle registrations under the provisions of Article 2 of chapter 3 of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes, except that the fee shall be paid in full for the then current year at the time any electric vehicle is first registered in a calendar year. c.     Fees collected pursuant to this section shall be credited to the "Transportation Trust Fund Account," established pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-20), in accordance with the provisions of subsection f. of section 20 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-20). d.    As used in this section: Commercial electric vehicle means any electric vehicle that is operated in interstate or intrastate commerce and used for the transportation of persons for hire, compensation or profit, or designed or used primarily for the transportation of property. Electric vehicle means any motor vehicle that is propelled solely by an electric motor or energy storage device, which electric motor or energy storage device can be charged from an electricity supply external to the vehicle. Passenger electric vehicle means any electric vehicle that is not a commercial electric vehicle. 9.    a.  There is appropriated from the General Fund to the New Jersey Transit Corporation the sum of $1,000,000,000, which shall be allocated in the following amounts for the following purposes, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting:  (1) $760,000,000 shall be for the financing of capital projects, and (2) $240,000,000 shall be for the corporations operating expenses. b.    The annual appropriations act for State Fiscal Year 2026 shall include an appropriation from the General Fund to the New Jersey Transit Corporation in the sum of $1,000,000,000, which shall be allocated in the following amounts for the following purposes, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting:  (1) $760,000,000 shall be for the financing of capital projects, and (2) $240,000,000 shall be for the corporations operating expenses. 10.  There is appropriated from the New Jersey Debt Defeasance and Prevention Fund the sum of $1,500,000,000 to the Transportation Trust Fund Account - Subaccount for Capital Reserves to be used for the funding of transportation capital projects on a pay-as-you-go basis, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting.  No funds appropriated pursuant to this section shall be expended for the payment of debt service on transportation system bonds, transportation program bonds, or any other bonds, notes or other obligations, including subordinated obligations of the authority. 11.  Section 11 of P.L.2003, c.266 (C.54:32B-8.55) is repealed. 12.  This act shall take effect immediately, provided that section 11 shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment and shall apply to all sales occurring on or after such date. STATEMENT This bill amends the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority Act of 1984 to make changes necessary to support the States Annual Transportation Capital Program (capital program) for Fiscal Years (FY) 2025 through 2032.  These changes also (1) extend the process for calculating the rate of tax imposed on highway fuels under the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax (PPGRT) through Fiscal Year 2032; (2) impose an additional registration fee for electric vehicles; (3) appropriate funds to the New Jersey Transit Corporation; (4) appropriate funds from the Debt Defeasance and Prevention Fund to the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF); and (5) repeal the sales and use tax exemption for zero emission vehicles. Transportation Trust Fund Authority Renewal This bill extends the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authoritys (authority) existing authorization to issue transportation program bonds and creates the potential to increase the authoritys bonding authorization from FY 2029 through FY 2032.  Under current law, the authority is authorized to issue such transportation program bonds as are necessary to fund the capital program, in an amount not to exceed $12 billion, through June 30, 2024.  The bill extends this authorization through June 30, 2032.  The bill requires the authority, on or before June 30, 2028, to assess whether its remaining bonding capacity is sufficient to fund the capital program through FY 2032 and report its findings to the Legislature and Governor.  If the authority determines that additional authorization is needed to fund the capital program, the Legislature and Governor may authorize the authority to issue a maximum of $4 billion in transportation program bonds from FY 2029 through FY 2032. This bill authorizes $15.96 billion in capital program expenditures for an eight-year period from FY 2025 through FY 2032.  Specifically, this bill allows for an average annual capital program size of $2 billion from FY 2025 through FY 2032.  The bill requires $500 million to be annually appropriated to the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ Transit) for capital projects during FY 2027 through FY 2032.  However, under the bill, no monies are to be appropriated in the capital program to NJ Transit for these purposes in FY 2025 and FY 2026. Extension of PPGRT Rate Adjustment Procedure Until 2032 This bill extends the PPGRT annual rate adjustment procedure through FY 2032. Under current law, the rate of tax imposed under the PPGRT is annually adjusted by the State Treasurer to ensure that the State realizes a statutorily prescribed revenue target, more commonly referred to as the highway fuel cap, based on 2016 collections of highway fuel taxes.  The cap amount is based on the Fiscal Year 2016 sum of: (1) the taxes collected under the Motor Fuel Tax, (2) the amount derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to the four cent motor fuel tax, and (3) the amount that would have been derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to the motor fuel tax at a rate of 23 cents per gallon. All revenues collected are deposited into the TTF to support transportation infrastructure projects and debt service on transportation bonds.  This annual adjustment mechanism is currently set to expire at the conclusion of FY 2026. The bill allows this process to continue through FY 2032. Additional Vehicle Registration Fee for Electric Vehicles The bill imposes an additional registration fee for electric vehicles registered in the State.  The fee would be collected by the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission at the same time the vehicle is initially registered or renewed, as the case may be. Beginning on July 1, 2024, the amount of the fee would be $300 for passenger electric vehicles and $450 for commercial electric vehicles. Under the bill, the revenues generated from these fees would be credited to the Transportation Trust Fund Account - Subaccount for Capital Reserves to support transportation projects. However, the bill specifies that these collections may not be used to pay debt service on transportation system bonds, transportation program bonds, or any other bonds, notes or other obligations, including subordinated obligations of the authority until such time as these revenues may be constitutionally dedicated to the TTF. Appropriation of Funds to New Jersey Transit The bill makes a supplemental appropriation of $1 billion from the General Fund to NJ Transit.  The bill requires $760 million of these funds to be used for the financing of capital projects and $240 million to be used for NJ Transit operating expenses.  The bill also requires the State to appropriate an additional $1 billion in FY 2026 for those same purposes. Appropriation of Funds from Debt Defeasance and Prevention Fund to TTF The bill appropriates $1.5 billion from the New Jersey Debt Defeasance and Prevention Fund to the Transportation Trust Fund Account - Subaccount for Capital Reserves to be used for the funding of transportation capital projects on a pay-as-you-go basis.  The bill prohibits the expenditure of these funds for debt service on transportation system bonds, transportation program bonds, or any other bonds, notes, or other obligations, including subordinated obligations of the TTF. Repeal of Sales Tax Exemption for Electric Vehicles The bill repeals the sales and use tax exemption currently provided for the sales of zero emission vehicles and annually dedicates the revenues derived from the sales of these vehicles, up to $100 million, to the TTF.  Specifically, these revenues would be credited to the Transportation Trust Fund Account - Subaccount for Capital Reserves to be used for transportation projects.  The bill also specifies that these collections may not be used to pay debt service on transportation system bonds, transportation program bonds, or any other bonds, notes, or other obligations, including subordinated obligations of the authority, until such time as these revenues may be constitutionally dedicated to the TTF.
