(cf: P.L.2007, c.191, s.7) 8.  Section 8 of P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-8) is amended to read as follows: 8.    Any contract awarded in connection with any project authorized pursuant to the provisions of [this act] P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-1 et seq.) shall provide that not less than the prevailing wage rate shall be paid to workers employed in the performance of such contract.  The prevailing wage rate shall be the rate determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2007, c.191, s.8) 9.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill removes a requirement of law that limits the types of broadband telecommunications services, also known as wireless Internet service, that may be provided by a local unit.  Specifically, the bill provides that local units would no longer be required to provide broadband telecommunications service through a wireless community network. Under current law, the governing body of a local unit, including counties, municipalities, and other local entities, is permitted to: (1) establish a related competitive business segment to: (i) construct, own, and operate broadband telecommunications infrastructure for the provision of broadband telecommunications service via a wireless community network; or (ii) provide broadband telecommunications service via a wireless community network; or (2) enter into a contract with a private entity to: (i) provide broadband telecommunications service via a wireless community network; or (ii) construct, own, use, acquire, deliver, grant, operate, maintain, sell, purchase, lease, or equip broadband telecommunications infrastructure for the provision of broadband telecommunications service via a wireless community network.  These local units are also permitted to issue revenues bonds, pursuant to the "Local Bond Law" (N.J.S. 40A:2-1 et seq.), to pay for all or part of the costs of the infrastructure used for these purposes. By removing the requirement for broadband telecommunications service to be provided via wireless community networks, this bill would authorize a local unit to provide broadband telecommunications service in any manner that the local unit deems necessary, provided that the local unit otherwise complies with the requirements of State and federal law.

In addition, the Local Finance Board shall forward the plan to any State agency with a potential interest in assisting, and statutory authority to assist with, project financing.  Any agency which has an interest in assisting with such financing shall give notice of its interest to the appropriate local unit, which shall maintain a list of all agencies interested in assisting with such financing. c.     The Local Finance Board shall review the plan and provide comments to the governing body of the local unit within 60 days after receipt thereof.  If the Local Finance Board fails to act within the 60-day period, or within such other time period as may be mutually agreed upon by the Local Finance Board and the local unit, the plan shall be deemed approved. (cf: P.L.2007, c.191, s.4) 5.  Section 5 of P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-5) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a. The governing body of a local unit exercising powers under subsection a. or subsection b. of section 2 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-2) is authorized, pursuant to the provisions of the "Local Bond Law" (N.J.S.40A:2-1 et seq.), to issue revenue bonds of the local unit, to pay a portion or all of the costs of the broadband telecommunications infrastructure used for the purpose of providing broadband telecommunications service [via a wireless community network]; provided, however, that the principal of and the interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from revenues derived by the local unit from the provision of broadband telecommunications service via that network and any other revenues related thereto.  A local unit is permitted to provide a full faith and credit guarantee on such revenue bonds. b. A State agency that assists in project financing shall not assist in financing the costs of constructing, operating or maintaining any broadband telecommunications infrastructure used for the purpose of providing broadband telecommunications service [via a wireless community network], if such network is offered commercially to the public. (cf: P.L.2007, c.191, s.5) 6.  Section 6 of P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-6) is amended to read as follows: 6.  The governing body of a local unit exercising powers under subsection a. or subsection b. of section 2 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-2) shall not enter into or implement any contract regarding broadband telecommunications infrastructure or broadband telecommunications service without first performing due diligence on the plan required under subsection a. of section 4 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-4).  Due diligence shall include, but not be limited to, research that supports formal conclusions that the local unit or private entity, as appropriate, is creditworthy and that the provision of broadband telecommunications service via that network would not proceed in the absence of financing from the local unit or private entity, as appropriate.  The conclusions of this analysis shall be reduced to writing and made available to the public before the governing body of the local unit formally considers any financing authorized pursuant to section 5 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-5) or enters into a contract with a private entity pursuant to subsection b. of section 2 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-2). (cf: P.L.2007, c.191, s.6) 7.  Section 7 of P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-7) is amended to read as follows: 7. a. In addition to the purposes set forth in section 1 of P.L.1999, c.440 (C.40A:11-4.1), a local contracting unit may use the competitive contracting provisions set forth in the "Local Public Contracts Law," P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.) as modified under this section, in lieu of public bidding, for the purpose of entering into a contract pursuant to subsection b. of section 2 of [this act] P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-2) concerning broadband telecommunications infrastructure for the provision of broadband telecommunications service [via a wireless community network]. b.    Contracts awarded pursuant to this section may be for a term not to exceed seven years, however, a contact awarded pursuant to this section may be extended for an additional term of three years by mutual agreement of the parties to the contract if the ability to extend was set forth in the original request for proposals documentation. c.     Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.440 (C.40A:11-4.5) to the contrary, after proposals have been evaluated pursuant to subsection d. of that section, the purchasing agent or counsel or administrator may issue an interim report recommending that specific details be negotiated further with one or more of the potential vendors who submitted a proposal for the purpose of modifying the original proposal.  After the conclusion of negotiations, and evaluation of all proposals as modified in accordance with this subsection, the purchasing agent or counsel or administrator shall prepare a final report evaluating proposals and recommending the award of a contract or contracts in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.440 (C.40A:11-4.5) that are not contrary to the provisions of this subsection. (cf: P.L.2007, c.191, s.7) 8.  Section 8 of P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-8) is amended to read as follows: 8.    Any contract awarded in connection with any project authorized pursuant to the provisions of [this act] P.L.2007, c.191 (C.40:9D-1 et seq.) shall provide that not less than the prevailing wage rate shall be paid to workers employed in the performance of such contract.  The prevailing wage rate shall be the rate determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2007, c.191, s.8) 9.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill removes a requirement of law that limits the types of broadband telecommunications services, also known as wireless Internet service, that may be provided by a local unit.  Specifically, the bill provides that local units would no longer be required to provide broadband telecommunications service through a wireless community network. Under current law, the governing body of a local unit, including counties, municipalities, and other local entities, is permitted to: (1) establish a related competitive business segment to: (i) construct, own, and operate broadband telecommunications infrastructure for the provision of broadband telecommunications service via a wireless community network; or (ii) provide broadband telecommunications service via a wireless community network; or (2) enter into a contract with a private entity to: (i) provide broadband telecommunications service via a wireless community network; or (ii) construct, own, use, acquire, deliver, grant, operate, maintain, sell, purchase, lease, or equip broadband telecommunications infrastructure for the provision of broadband telecommunications service via a wireless community network.  These local units are also permitted to issue revenues bonds, pursuant to the "Local Bond Law" (N.J.S. 40A:2-1 et seq.), to pay for all or part of the costs of the infrastructure used for these purposes. By removing the requirement for broadband telecommunications service to be provided via wireless community networks, this bill would authorize a local unit to provide broadband telecommunications service in any manner that the local unit deems necessary, provided that the local unit otherwise complies with the requirements of State and federal law.
