The chief administrator is required to annually certify the average cost of producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the availability of the specialty license plates.  If the average cost per plate exceeds $50 in two consecutive fiscal years, the chief administrator may discontinue the license plate program.  The bill also requires that the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (department) appoint a liaison to represent the department in all communications with the MVC regarding the license plates. The bill provides that State or other public funds may not be used by the MVC for the initial cost to implement the license plate program.  The bill requires the department, or an individual or entity designated by the department, to contribute non-public monies, not to exceed $25,000, to offset the initial costs to design, produce, issue, and publicize the license plates and for any computer programming necessary to implement the program.  The bill authorizes the department to receive funds from private sources to be used to offset the initial costs. The chief administrator is not required to design, produce, issue, or publicize the availability of the license plates, or make any necessary programming changes, until: (1) the department, or an individual or entity designated by the department, has provided the MVC with the money necessary to offset the initial costs incurred by the MVC in establishing the license plate program; and (2) the department has provided the MVC with a minimum of 500 completed applications for the license plates, upon the availability for purchase of those license plates. The provisions of the bill will remain inoperative until the appropriate applications and fees required to offset the initial costs incurred by the MVC are provided by the department or its designee.  The bill expires on the last day of the 12th month after the bills enactment if sufficient applications and fees to offset the initial costs are not received.
