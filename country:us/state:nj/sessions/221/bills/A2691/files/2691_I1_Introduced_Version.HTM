<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires school
districts to allow students who receive equivalent instruction other than at
school, and students who attend charter schools or county vocational schools,
to participate in interscholastic sports programs in the students resident
district in accordance with the same criteria established for students enrolled
in the district.  The bill also provides that interscholastic sports programs
offered by charter schools and county vocational school districts must be
available to students attending other public schools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a student who
receives equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school who wishes to try out
for, and participate in, school-sponsored interscholastic athletics in his
resident district must:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    provide proof that he
resides in the district; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    meet the sports
participation requirements established by the school district for students
enrolled in the district such as physical examinations, insurance, age,
academic, and other requirements.  The student must comply with the same
standards of behavior, responsibilities, and performance as other members of
the team; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)    demonstrate to the board
of education that he is receiving an academically equivalent education compared
to students enrolled in the school district and that he is academically
qualified to participate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the current rules of the
New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA), the
participation of such a student is at the discretion of the board of education
of the resident school district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of a student
enrolled in a charter school or county vocational school, the student may try
out for, and participate in, interscholastic athletics in his resident district
if the students charter school or county vocational school does not sponsor an
interscholastic sports team in the sport in which the student wishes to
participate.  In order to participate, the student must comply with the
requirements listed above, other than the requirement to demonstrate
academically equivalent instruction.  Under current NJSIAA rules, a student
enrolled in a charter school or full-time in a county vocational school may
only participate in interscholastic athletics in the resident district if the
principal of the charter school or county vocational school, as applicable, and
the principal of the resident district school agree to such participation. 
There are reciprocal provisions in the bill for students enrolled in public
schools who may want to participate in interscholastic athletics sponsored by
charter schools or county vocational school districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, any
controversy in regard to whether a home-schooled student, a charter school
student, a county vocational school student, or other public school student
meets the eligibility requirements for student athletes established by the
NJSIAA will be adjudicated by the association in compliance with its
constitution and by-laws.</p>
