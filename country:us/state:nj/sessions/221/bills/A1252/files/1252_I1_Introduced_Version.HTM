CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Supplement to the annual appropriations act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, P.L.2023, c.74. Be It Enacted by the Senate and the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  In addition to the amounts appropriated under P.L.2023, c.74, the annual appropriations act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, there is appropriated from the General Fund the following amount for the purpose specified: 74 STATE 30 Educational, Cultural, and Intellectual Development 36 Higher Educational Services 2415 Agricultural Experiment Station GRANTS-IN-AID 82-2415  Institutional Support ............................................... $250,000 Total Grants-in-Aid appropriation, Agricultural Experiment Station ........................ $250,000 Grants-in-Aid: 82    Deer-Resistant Native Species   Propagation ($250,000) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill supplements the fiscal year 2024 appropriations act to provide a $250,000 appropriation for Deer-Resistant Native Species Propagation at the Agricultural Experiment Station. This project will entail collecting cuttings and seeds of specific plants and woody shrubs, and developing propagation protocols for each plant.  The project will involve plant specimens from various regions of the State with traits that may aid in reducing damage from deer to nurseries and other landscapes. New Jersey is home to an estimated 125,000 deer, however unchecked deer populations can pose numerous problems, including increased deer-vehicle collisions and damage to gardens, agricultural crops, and the natural forest ecosystem. While New Jersey allows limited hunting of deer to manage the population, the project funded by this appropriation would explore nonlethal, environmentally-friendly means of mitigating deer-related damage to the States ecosystem.
