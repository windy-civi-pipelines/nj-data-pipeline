Under this bill, car manufacturers would be required to engrave or stamp the vehicle identification number onto the catalytic converter of a motor vehicle sold within the State. It is the sponsors belief that this bill is necessary given the increasing number of thefts, and that once scrap yards and would-be thieves become aware of the new requirements, thefts will decrease.
