agreement with another state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the film and digital
media content production tax credit program, the New Jersey Economic
Development Authority (EDA) awards corporation business tax and gross income
tax credits to eligible taxpayers equal to (1) 30 percent of the qualified film
production expenses incurred for use within certain parts of Northern New
Jersey, or 35 percent of qualified film production expenses incurred for use
within all other parts of the State; and (2) 35 percent of the qualified
digital media content production expenses incurred through vendors located in
certain counties in Southern New Jersey, or 30 percent of all other qualified
digital media content production expenses incurred through vendors within the
State.  In addition to certain other eligibility requirements, current law also
provides that to qualify for the digital media content production tax credit,
at least 50 percent of the qualified digital media content production expenses

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Increased Digital Media Content

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill increases the amount
of digital media content production tax credits that may be awarded to
taxpayers for qualified digital media content production expenses related to
certain post-production services, including visual effects.  Specifically, the
tax credit would be equal to 40 percent of the qualified digital media content
production expenses of the taxpayer incurred during the tax period for
post-production services performed at a New Jersey film-lease production
facility, provided that at least $500,000 of these expenses were incurred for
services performed at the New Jersey film-lease production facility. 
Additionally, the tax credit would be equal to 35 percent of the qualified
digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer incurred during the
tax period for post-production services performed by independent
post-production companies, as defined in the bill.  In either circumstance, if
the taxpayer includes a diversity plan with their tax credit application and
complies with all relevant requirements established in that plan, the
taxpayers tax credit may be increased by an additional four percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the terms
qualified film production expenses and qualified digital media content
production expenses are defined to include, among other expenses, the wages
and salaries paid to individuals who are employed for the purposes of the
production and who are subject to the tax imposed by the New Jersey Gross
Income Tax Act.  Current law also defines the term full-time or full-time
equivalent employee to include persons working not less than 35 hours per
week, or other standard of service accepted by custom or practice as full-time
or full-time equivalent employment, and whose wages and salaries are subject to
withholding as provided in the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill expands the scope of
qualified film production expenses and qualified digital media content
production expenses to include wages and salaries that are paid to individuals
who are employed for the purposes of the production and who are not subject to
tax under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act due to the provisions of a tax
reciprocity agreement with another state.  The bill also provides that these
expenses would include any payments made by the taxpayer to a loan out company
for services performed in New Jersey by individuals who are employed by the
loan out company and whose wages and salaries are not subject to tax under the
New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act due to the provisions of a tax reciprocity

the definition full-time or full-time equivalent employee to include

reciprocity agreement with another state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, the State has
entered into a reciprocal income tax agreement with the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.  Under the terms of this agreement, compensation paid to
Pennsylvania residents who are employed in New Jersey is not subject to tax
under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act.  Accordingly, the bill provides
that wages and salaries paid to certain Pennsylvania residents may be included
as qualified film production expenses and qualified digital media content
production expenses, provided that these persons are employed in New Jersey for
the purposes of the film or digital media content production.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
certain tenants of New Jersey film-lease partner facilities would be eligible
for tax credits under the program.  Specifically, the bill provides that any
film production company that enters into a lease or sublease with the owner or
developer of a designated New Jersey film-lease partner facility before receipt
of the facilitys temporary or final certificate of occupancy, which lease or
sublease is for not less than three years and includes at least 36,000 square feet
of soundstage space, and which company executes a contract to provide
production services for all films produced at the New Jersey film-lease partner
facility, would be eligible for the tax credit allowed for a taxpayer
designated as a New Jersey film-lease production company, provided that the
film production company satisfies all other eligibility requirements for New
Jersey film-lease production companies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the EDA determines that a
New Jersey film-lease partner facility has failed to meet the requirements of
the program, the EDA may rescind the New Jersey film-lease partner facility
designation.  In this circumstance, the bill provides that any tenant of the
New Jersey film-lease production company that has entered into a lease for the
film-lease partner facility would not be entitled to the portion of any tax
credit that is only available to the New Jersey film-lease production company
by virtue of the company being a tenant at a New Jersey film-lease partner
facility.</p>
