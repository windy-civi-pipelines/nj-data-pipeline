AR184 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 184 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 24, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  MICHAEL INGANAMORT District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) Assemblyman  GERRY SCHARFENBERGER District 13 (Monmouth) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Fantasia SYNOPSIS Urges Congress to support policies that examine international pollution differential and hold foreign polluters accountable for their pollution. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Assembly Resolution urging Congress to support policies that examine the international pollution differential and hold foreign polluters accountable for their pollution. Whereas, New Jerseys natural resources and environment are important to the States character, economy, and way of life; and Whereas, New Jersey has a long history of investment in, and protection of, the States natural resources and environment, including the protection of the New Jersey Highlands Region, the pinelands area, waterway rehabilitation, air quality improvements, and water quality infrastructure; and Whereas, The United States has reduced more carbon emissions than any other country in the last 15 years and has an economy that is 44 percent more carbon efficient than the world average; and Whereas, Manufacturers in the United States are more efficient in nearly every industry and yet are forced to compete with companies in China and other countries that face few limits on how much they pollute; and Whereas, In contrast, China, by far the worlds largest polluter, accounts for an over 30 percent share of global carbon dioxide emissions and subsidizes its exports by not imposing or enforcing reasonable environmental and labor standards; and Whereas, Goods produced in China and Russia generate 300 percent and 400 percent on average, respectively, more in carbon emissions compared to equivalent goods produced in the United States; and Whereas, United States trade policy has not taken into account carbon emissions, and as a result, afforded foreign polluters with loose carbon standards an advantage over the United States for the past several decades; and Whereas, The Chinese government-owned industry is an arm of the Chinese Communist Party and strives to increase its influence over the global economy by pursuing predatory trade practices such as stealing intellectual property from the United States; and Whereas, China benefits from the current federal trade policy; and Whereas, Rewarding United States firms for their environmental performance would bolster domestic manufacturing, generate good-paying jobs, and reduce dependence on imports from high-emitting producers like China and Russia; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This House respectfully urges the United States Congress to support policies that examine the pollution differential between the United States pollution production and that of other countries, and that hold other countries accountable for the extent of their pollution. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and every member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution would urge Congress to support policies that examine the pollution differential between the United States pollution production and that of other countries.  This resolution also urges Congress to support policies that hold foreign polluters accountable to the extent of their pollution. The United States has reduced more carbon emissions than any other country in the last 15 years and has an economy that is 44 percent more carbon efficient than the world average.  Manufacturers in the United States are more efficient in nearly every industry and yet are forced to compete with companies in China and other countries that face few limits on how much they pollute. In contrast, China, by far the worlds largest polluter, accounts for an over 30 percent share of global carbon dioxide emissions and subsidizes its exports by not imposing or enforcing reasonable environmental and labor standard.  In 2022, China emitted 12,667.4 million tons of carbon dioxide while the United States emitted 4,853.8 million tons.  As the United States has made efforts to reduce its pollution production from nonrenewable sources, Chinas energy production from coal, gas, and oil has only increased over time. Goods produced in China and Russia generate 300 percent and 400 percent on average, respectively, more in carbon emissions compared to equivalent goods produced in the United States. United States trade policy has not taken into account carbon emissions, and as a result, has afforded foreign polluters with loose carbon standards an advantage over the United States for the past several decades.  The Chinese government-owned industry is an arm of the Chinese Communist Party and strives to further increase its influence over the global economy in its trade practices. Rewarding United States firms for their environmental performance would bolster domestic manufacturing, generate well-paying jobs, and reduce dependence on imports from high-emitting producers like China and Russia.  This resolution would encourage the United States Congress to support policies that investigate the pollution differential between international countries, and strategies that hold those companies accountable for their pollution through international economic and trade policy.
