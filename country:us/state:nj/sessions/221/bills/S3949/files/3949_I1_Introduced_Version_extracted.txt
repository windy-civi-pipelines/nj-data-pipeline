For purposes of this section, it shall not be a defense that the operator of the motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter was unaware of the existence or extent of personal injury or property damage caused by the accident as long as the operator was aware that he was involved in an accident. There shall be a permissive inference that the registered owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter which was involved in an accident subject to the provisions of this section was the person involved in the accident; provided, however, if that vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter is owned by a rental car company or is a leased vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter, there shall be a permissive inference that the renter or authorized driver or operator pursuant to a rental car contract or the lessee, and not the owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter, was involved in the accident, and the requirements and penalties imposed pursuant to this section shall be applicable to that renter or authorized driver or operator or lessee and not the owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter. Any person who suppresses, by way of concealment or destruction, any evidence of a violation of this section or who suppresses the identity of the violator shall be subject to a fine of not less than $250 or more than $1,000. (cf: P.L.2007, c.266, s.1) 4.    R.S.39:4-130 is amended to read as follows: 39:4-130. The driver or operator of a vehicle or street car or operator of a low-speed electric bicycle, low-speed electric scooter involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person, or damage to property of any one person in excess of $500.00 shall by the quickest means of communication give notice of such accident to the local police department or to the nearest office of the county police of the county or of the State Police, and in addition shall within 10 days after such accident forward a written report of such accident to the commission on forms furnished by it.  Such written reports shall contain sufficiently detailed information with reference to a motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter accident, including the cause, the conditions then existing, the persons and vehicles, low-speed electric bicycles, or low-speed electric scooters involved and such information as may be necessary to enable the chief administrator to determine whether the requirements for the deposit of security required by law are inapplicable by reason of the existence of insurance or other circumstances.  The chief administrator may rely upon the accuracy of the information contained in any such report, unless he has reason to believe that the report is erroneous.  The commission may require operators involved in accidents to file supplemental reports of accidents upon forms furnished by it when in the opinion of the commission, the original report is insufficient.  The reports shall be without prejudice, shall be for the information of the commission, and shall not be open to public inspection.  The fact that the reports have been so made shall be admissible in evidence solely to prove a compliance with this section, but no report or any part thereof or statement contained therein shall be admissible in evidence for any other purpose in any proceeding or action arising out of the accident. Whenever the driver or operator of a vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter is physically incapable of giving immediate notice or making a written report of an accident as required in this section and there was another occupant in the vehicle at the time of the accident capable of giving notice or making a report, such occupant shall make or cause to be made said notice or report not made by the driver or operator. Whenever the driver or operator is physically incapable of making a written report of an accident as required by this section and such driver is not the owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter, then the owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter involved in such accident shall make such report not made by the driver or operator. In those cases where a driver or operator knowingly violates the provisions of this section by failing to make a written report of an accident, there shall be a permissive inference that the registered owner of the vehicle, or owner of the low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter which was involved in that accident was the person involved in the accident; provided, however, if that vehicle is owned by a rental car company or a company engaged in the business of renting low-speed electric bicycles or low-speed electric scooters, or is a leased vehicle, there shall be a permissive inference that the renter or authorized driver or operator pursuant to a rental car contract or low-speed electric bicycle or low-speed electric scooter rental contract or the lessee, and not the owner of the vehicle, was the person involved in the accident, and the requirements and penalties imposed pursuant to this section shall be applicable to that renter or authorized driver, operator, or lessee and not the owner of the vehicle. Any person who suppresses, by way of concealment or destruction, any evidence of a violation of this section or who suppresses the identity of the violator shall be subject to a fine of not less than $250 or more than $1,000. A written report of an accident shall not be required by this section if a law enforcement officer submits a written report of the accident to the commission pursuant to R.S.39:4-131. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person who knowingly violates this section shall be fined not less than $30 or more than $100. The chief administrator may revoke or suspend the operator's license privilege and registration privilege of a person who violates this section. For purposes of this section, it shall not be a defense that the operator of the motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter was unaware of the existence or extent of personal injury or property damage caused by the accident as long as the operator was aware that he was involved in an accident. (cf: P.L.2007, c.266, s.2) 5.    R.S.39:4-131 is amended to read as follows: 39:4-131.  The Department of Transportation shall prepare and supply to police departments and other suitable agencies, forms for accident reports calling for sufficiently detailed information with reference to a motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter accident, including the cause, the conditions then existing, the persons [and], vehicles, and low-speed electric bicycles, or low-speed electric scooters involved, the compliance with P.L.1984, c.179 (C.39:3-76.2e et seq.) by the operators and passengers of the vehicles, low-speed electric bicycles, or low-speed electric scooters involved in the accident, whether the operator of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter was using a cellular telephone when the accident occurred, and such other information as the Commissioner of Transportation may require. Every law enforcement officer who investigates a vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter accident of which report must be made as required in this Title, or who otherwise prepares a written or an electronic report as a result of an accident or thereafter by interviewing the participants or witnesses, shall electronically transmit a report of such accident to the department, on forms furnished by it and in the electronic format prescribed by the department, within five days after the law enforcement officer's investigation of the accident. Such written or electronic reports required to be prepared by law enforcement officers and the information contained therein shall not be privileged or held confidential.  Every citizen of this State shall have the right, during regular business hours and under supervision, to inspect and copy such reports and shall also have the right in person to purchase copies of the reports at the same fee established by section 6 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5).  If copies of reports are requested other than in person, an additional fee of up to $5 may be added to cover the administrative costs of the report.  Upon request, a police department shall send an accident report to a person through the mail or via fax.  The police department may require the person requesting the report to provide a completed request form and the appropriate fee prior to faxing or mailing the report. The police department shall provide the person requesting the report with the option of submitting the form and providing the appropriate fee either in person, through the mail, or via fax. The provisions of any other law or regulation to the contrary notwithstanding, reports obtained pursuant to this act shall not be subject to confidentiality requirements except as provided by section 28 of P.L.1960, c.52 (C.2A:84A-28). When a motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter accident results in the death or incapacitation of the driver, operator, or any passenger, the law enforcement officer responsible for notifying the next of kin that their relative is deceased or incapacitated, also shall inform the relative, in writing, how to obtain a copy of the accident report required by this section and the name, address, and telephone number of the person storing the motor vehicle pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1964, c.81 (C.39:10A-1). The New Jersey Department of Transportation shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations to require law enforcement officers to electronically transmit crash reports required to be prepared pursuant to this section. (cf: P.L.2023, c.55, s.1) 6.   This act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill provides that the operator of a bicycle, low-speed electric bicycle or low-speed electric scooter is a pedestrian for purposes of determining eligibility for personal injury protection benefits under an automobile insurance policy.  Under current law, only certain persons, including those who are pedestrians, are eligible to receive personal injury protection benefits for injuries resulting from a motor vehicle accident.  The term pedestrian is defined in current law to mean any person who is not occupying, entering into, or alighting from a vehicle propelled by other than muscular power and designed primarily for use on highways, rails and tracks. This bill is in response to a recent decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court, Goyco v. Progressive Ins. Co., A-12-23, 088497, 2024 N.J. Lexis 388 (May 14, 2024), in which the Court determined that the operator of a low-speed electric scooter is not a pedestrian and is therefore ineligible for personal injury protection benefits. In addition, the bill incorporates low-speed electric bicycles and low-speed electric scooters into the various parts of existing law requiring crash reports.

In the event that none of the persons specified are in condition to receive the information to which they otherwise would be entitled under this subsection, and no police officer is present, the driver or operator of any vehicle involved in such accident after fulfilling all other requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, insofar as possible on his part to be performed, shall forthwith report such accident to the nearest office of the local police department or of the county police of the county or of the State Police and submit thereto the information specified in this subsection. (d)   The driver or operator of any vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter which knowingly collides with or is knowingly involved in an accident with any vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter, or other property which is unattended resulting in any damage to such vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter, or other property shall immediately stop and shall then and there locate and notify the operator or owner of such vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter, or other property of the name and address of the driver or operator, and owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter striking the unattended vehicle or other property or, in the event an unattended vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter is struck and the driver or operator or owner thereof cannot be immediately located, shall attach securely in a conspicuous place in or on such vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter a written notice giving the name and address of the driver or operator and owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter doing the striking or, in the event other property is struck and the owner thereof cannot be immediately located, shall notify the nearest office of the local police department or of the county police of the county or of the State Police and in addition shall notify the owner of the property as soon as the owner can be identified and located. Any person who violates this subsection shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section. (e)   There shall be a permissive inference that the driver or operator of any motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter involved in an accident resulting in injury or death to any person or damage in the amount of $250.00 or more to any vehicle or property has knowledge that he was involved in such accident. For purposes of this section, it shall not be a defense that the operator of the motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter was unaware of the existence or extent of personal injury or property damage caused by the accident as long as the operator was aware that he was involved in an accident. There shall be a permissive inference that the registered owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter which was involved in an accident subject to the provisions of this section was the person involved in the accident; provided, however, if that vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter is owned by a rental car company or is a leased vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter, there shall be a permissive inference that the renter or authorized driver or operator pursuant to a rental car contract or the lessee, and not the owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter, was involved in the accident, and the requirements and penalties imposed pursuant to this section shall be applicable to that renter or authorized driver or operator or lessee and not the owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter. Any person who suppresses, by way of concealment or destruction, any evidence of a violation of this section or who suppresses the identity of the violator shall be subject to a fine of not less than $250 or more than $1,000. (cf: P.L.2007, c.266, s.1) 4.    R.S.39:4-130 is amended to read as follows: 39:4-130. The driver or operator of a vehicle or street car or operator of a low-speed electric bicycle, low-speed electric scooter involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person, or damage to property of any one person in excess of $500.00 shall by the quickest means of communication give notice of such accident to the local police department or to the nearest office of the county police of the county or of the State Police, and in addition shall within 10 days after such accident forward a written report of such accident to the commission on forms furnished by it.  Such written reports shall contain sufficiently detailed information with reference to a motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter accident, including the cause, the conditions then existing, the persons and vehicles, low-speed electric bicycles, or low-speed electric scooters involved and such information as may be necessary to enable the chief administrator to determine whether the requirements for the deposit of security required by law are inapplicable by reason of the existence of insurance or other circumstances.  The chief administrator may rely upon the accuracy of the information contained in any such report, unless he has reason to believe that the report is erroneous.  The commission may require operators involved in accidents to file supplemental reports of accidents upon forms furnished by it when in the opinion of the commission, the original report is insufficient.  The reports shall be without prejudice, shall be for the information of the commission, and shall not be open to public inspection.  The fact that the reports have been so made shall be admissible in evidence solely to prove a compliance with this section, but no report or any part thereof or statement contained therein shall be admissible in evidence for any other purpose in any proceeding or action arising out of the accident. Whenever the driver or operator of a vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter is physically incapable of giving immediate notice or making a written report of an accident as required in this section and there was another occupant in the vehicle at the time of the accident capable of giving notice or making a report, such occupant shall make or cause to be made said notice or report not made by the driver or operator. Whenever the driver or operator is physically incapable of making a written report of an accident as required by this section and such driver is not the owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter, then the owner of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter involved in such accident shall make such report not made by the driver or operator. In those cases where a driver or operator knowingly violates the provisions of this section by failing to make a written report of an accident, there shall be a permissive inference that the registered owner of the vehicle, or owner of the low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter which was involved in that accident was the person involved in the accident; provided, however, if that vehicle is owned by a rental car company or a company engaged in the business of renting low-speed electric bicycles or low-speed electric scooters, or is a leased vehicle, there shall be a permissive inference that the renter or authorized driver or operator pursuant to a rental car contract or low-speed electric bicycle or low-speed electric scooter rental contract or the lessee, and not the owner of the vehicle, was the person involved in the accident, and the requirements and penalties imposed pursuant to this section shall be applicable to that renter or authorized driver, operator, or lessee and not the owner of the vehicle. Any person who suppresses, by way of concealment or destruction, any evidence of a violation of this section or who suppresses the identity of the violator shall be subject to a fine of not less than $250 or more than $1,000. A written report of an accident shall not be required by this section if a law enforcement officer submits a written report of the accident to the commission pursuant to R.S.39:4-131. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person who knowingly violates this section shall be fined not less than $30 or more than $100. The chief administrator may revoke or suspend the operator's license privilege and registration privilege of a person who violates this section. For purposes of this section, it shall not be a defense that the operator of the motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter was unaware of the existence or extent of personal injury or property damage caused by the accident as long as the operator was aware that he was involved in an accident. (cf: P.L.2007, c.266, s.2) 5.    R.S.39:4-131 is amended to read as follows: 39:4-131.  The Department of Transportation shall prepare and supply to police departments and other suitable agencies, forms for accident reports calling for sufficiently detailed information with reference to a motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter accident, including the cause, the conditions then existing, the persons [and], vehicles, and low-speed electric bicycles, or low-speed electric scooters involved, the compliance with P.L.1984, c.179 (C.39:3-76.2e et seq.) by the operators and passengers of the vehicles, low-speed electric bicycles, or low-speed electric scooters involved in the accident, whether the operator of the vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter was using a cellular telephone when the accident occurred, and such other information as the Commissioner of Transportation may require. Every law enforcement officer who investigates a vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter accident of which report must be made as required in this Title, or who otherwise prepares a written or an electronic report as a result of an accident or thereafter by interviewing the participants or witnesses, shall electronically transmit a report of such accident to the department, on forms furnished by it and in the electronic format prescribed by the department, within five days after the law enforcement officer's investigation of the accident. Such written or electronic reports required to be prepared by law enforcement officers and the information contained therein shall not be privileged or held confidential.  Every citizen of this State shall have the right, during regular business hours and under supervision, to inspect and copy such reports and shall also have the right in person to purchase copies of the reports at the same fee established by section 6 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5).  If copies of reports are requested other than in person, an additional fee of up to $5 may be added to cover the administrative costs of the report.  Upon request, a police department shall send an accident report to a person through the mail or via fax.  The police department may require the person requesting the report to provide a completed request form and the appropriate fee prior to faxing or mailing the report. The police department shall provide the person requesting the report with the option of submitting the form and providing the appropriate fee either in person, through the mail, or via fax. The provisions of any other law or regulation to the contrary notwithstanding, reports obtained pursuant to this act shall not be subject to confidentiality requirements except as provided by section 28 of P.L.1960, c.52 (C.2A:84A-28). When a motor vehicle, low-speed electric bicycle, or low-speed electric scooter accident results in the death or incapacitation of the driver, operator, or any passenger, the law enforcement officer responsible for notifying the next of kin that their relative is deceased or incapacitated, also shall inform the relative, in writing, how to obtain a copy of the accident report required by this section and the name, address, and telephone number of the person storing the motor vehicle pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1964, c.81 (C.39:10A-1). The New Jersey Department of Transportation shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations to require law enforcement officers to electronically transmit crash reports required to be prepared pursuant to this section. (cf: P.L.2023, c.55, s.1) 6.   This act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill provides that the operator of a bicycle, low-speed electric bicycle or low-speed electric scooter is a pedestrian for purposes of determining eligibility for personal injury protection benefits under an automobile insurance policy.  Under current law, only certain persons, including those who are pedestrians, are eligible to receive personal injury protection benefits for injuries resulting from a motor vehicle accident.  The term pedestrian is defined in current law to mean any person who is not occupying, entering into, or alighting from a vehicle propelled by other than muscular power and designed primarily for use on highways, rails and tracks. This bill is in response to a recent decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court, Goyco v. Progressive Ins. Co., A-12-23, 088497, 2024 N.J. Lexis 388 (May 14, 2024), in which the Court determined that the operator of a low-speed electric scooter is not a pedestrian and is therefore ineligible for personal injury protection benefits. In addition, the bill incorporates low-speed electric bicycles and low-speed electric scooters into the various parts of existing law requiring crash reports.
