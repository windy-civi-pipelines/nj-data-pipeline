CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning categorical eligibility for subsidized child care services and supplementing Title 30 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  As used in this act, qualifying child care worker means an educator or staff member who is employed, for a minimum of 20 hours per week, by a licensed child care center or registered family child care provider. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, a qualifying child care worker shall be eligible for child care services through the States subsidized child care assistance program to the same extent as any other participant in the program, regardless of the familys annual household income. c.     The Commissioner of Human Services shall establish a process by which the department shall confirm that a qualifying child care worker satisfies the employment criteria required to access the benefit established pursuant to this section. d.    The commissioner shall apply for such State plan amendments or waivers as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act and to continue to secure federal financial participation for subsidized child care services for eligible families under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, Pub.L.97-35 (42 U.S.C. s.9857 et seq.), as amended. e.     The commissioner shall adopt such rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this act. 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following the date of enactment, but the Commissioner of Human Services may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as may be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill provides categorical eligibility for child care subsidies to qualifying employees of licensed child care centers or registered family child care providers, regardless of the qualifying employees annual income.  It is the sponsors belief that providing access to child care subsidies for employees of child care facilities, regardless of income, will raise the compensation level for these essential workers and support the recruitment and retention of child care employees. The bill provides eligibility for child care services through the States subsidized child care assistance program for qualifying child care workers, regardless of the individuals annual family income.  The bill defines a qualifying child care worker as an educator or staff member who is employed by a licensed child care center or a registered family child care provider for a minimum of 20 hours per week. Under the bill, the Commissioner of Human Services is directed to establish a process by which the department will confirm that a qualifying child care worker is employed by a child care provider for the number of hours required to access the child care subsidy benefit.  The commissioner, moreover, is to apply for any State plan amendments or waivers necessary to ensure continuation of federal funding for subsidized child care services for eligible families under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. This bill is modeled on a similar policy adopted in Kentucky in 2022, which is supported by funds awarded to the state under the American Rescue Plan Act.
