has taken place or if no first appearance is required, the court shall schedule
the pretrial detention hearing to take place within three working days of the
date on which the prosecutors motion was filed, unless the prosecutor or the
eligible defendant seeks a continuance.  Except for good cause, a continuance
on motion of the eligible defendant may not exceed five days, not including any
intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.  Except for good cause, a
continuance on motion of the prosecutor may not exceed three days, not
including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</p>

issue a notice to appear to compel the appearance of the eligible defendant at
the detention hearing.  The court, on motion of the prosecutor or sua sponte,
may order that, while in custody, an eligible defendant who appears to be a
drug-dependent person receive an assessment to determine whether that eligible
defendant is drug-dependent.</p>

counsel, and, if financially unable to obtain adequate representation, to have
counsel appointed.  The eligible defendant shall be afforded an opportunity to
testify, to present witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the
hearing, and to present information by proffer or otherwise.  The rules
concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials shall not apply to the
presentation and consideration of information at the hearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  In pretrial detention
proceedings for which there is no indictment, the prosecutor shall establish
probable cause that the eligible defendant committed the predicate offense.  A
presumption of pretrial detention as provided in subsection b. of this section
may be rebutted by proof provided by the eligible defendant, the prosecutor, or
from other materials submitted to the court.  The standard of proof for a
rebuttal of the presumption of pretrial detention shall be a preponderance of
the evidence.  If proof cannot be established to rebut the presumption, the
court may order the eligible defendant's pretrial detention.  If the
presumption is rebutted by sufficient proof, the prosecutor shall have the
opportunity to establish that the grounds for pretrial detention exist pursuant
to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Except when an eligible

no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary
bail and conditions will reasonably assure the eligible defendants appearance
in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the

reopened, before or after a determination by the court, at any time before
trial, if the court finds that information exists that was not known to the

material bearing on the issue of whether there are conditions of release that
will reasonably assure the eligible defendants appearance in court when
required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or
that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the
criminal justice process.</p>

the presumption of release as set forth in subsection b. of section 4 of
P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18), if the court finds probable cause that the
eligible defendant committed any crime for which the eligible defendant would

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends and updates
the law prohibiting child pornography in two important respects.  First, under
the bill, the statute concerning child pornography is separated from its
current placement within the statute concerning child endangerment, so as to
create a separate and distinct crime.  This is intended to provide clarity in
law enforcement and court documents, and the analysis and tracking of crime
statistics, when referring to child pornography rather than the broader crime
of child endangerment.  Because of this recodification of the statute, it is
necessary to also update the cross references in other sections of law that
refer to either child pornography or child endangerment.  Second, under the
bill, the crime of child pornography is expanded to include manipulated
depictions, also known as deepfakes, that by means of image manipulation,
creation, or modification, appear to show an identifiable child or a purported
child engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such an act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends the
statutes concerning obscenity to include manipulated depictions, also known as
deepfakes, that by means of image manipulation, creation, or modification,
appear to show a purported child engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the
simulation of such an act.  Under current jurisprudence, the distinction
between child pornography and obscenity is that child pornography involves the
depiction of an actual victim (i.e., an identifiable child), while obscenity
does not require the depiction of an actual victim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends the
statute concerning leaders of child pornography networks to bring that statute
into conformity with the provision of the child pornography statute concerning
possession with intent to distribute.  Under current law, leader of a child
pornography network is a crime of the first degree if the offense involves 100,000
or more items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, a crime of
the second degree if the offense involves at least 1,000 but less than 100,000
items, and a crime of the third degree if the offense involves less than 1,000
items.  Under the bill, leader of a child pornography network is a crime of the
first degree if the offense involves 1,000 or more items; otherwise it is a
crime of the second degree.  These are the same thresholds as the crime of
possession with intent to distribute child pornography.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A crime of the first degree is
punishable by a term of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years, a fine of up to
$200,000, or both.  A crime of the second degree is punishable by a term of
imprisonment of five to ten years, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.  A crime
of the third degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of three to five
years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill also amends
the invasion of privacy statute in two important respects.  First, the statute
is amended to include manipulated depictions, also known as deepfakes, that
by means of image manipulation, creation, or modification, appear to show an
intimate or sexually explicit image of a person who did not in fact consent to
such depiction or engage in the depicted conduct.  Second, the statute is
amended to clarify that a persons consent to being photographed, filmed, or
recorded in an intimate or sexual manner does not imply consent to the
distribution of such images.</p>
