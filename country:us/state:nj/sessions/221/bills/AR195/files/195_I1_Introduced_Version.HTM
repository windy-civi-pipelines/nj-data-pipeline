AR195 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 195 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 19, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  AURA K. DUNN District 25 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Urges public high schools in New Jersey to create Pathways to Purpose Week. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Assembly Resolution urging public high schools in this State to create a Pathways to Purpose Week for graduating seniors the week in which May 1 falls. Whereas, May 1 is the day most colleges require high school seniors to confirm their enrollment; and Whereas, Many New Jersey high schools celebrate a College Decision Day on May 1 when graduating seniors wear paraphernalia from the college of their choice and are honored; and Whereas, Nearly 30 percent of New Jersey high school seniors do not enroll in higher education immediately following graduation; and Whereas, The number of graduating high school seniors enrolling in apprenticeships has declined each year since 2016 according to data reported to the Department of Education; and Whereas, Presidential Executive Order 14278 of 2025 requires the Secretary of Education, along with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce, to submit a plan to reach and surpass one million new active apprentices. The plan is to include opportunities to enhance the connections between the education system and registered apprenticeships; and Whereas, New Jersey are underrepresented in enlisted military members in the 18 to 24 age range according to the Federal Department of Defense; and Whereas, Military enlistment provides a pathway to high school graduates to make a career in the armed services as well as provide an alternate path to higher education; and Whereas, It is important that New Jersey high school students know that there are multiple paths to success after graduation and each path is valuable and worthy of celebration; and Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper, and within the public interest, to urge New Jersey high schools to designate the week in which May 1 falls as Pathways of Purpose week.  This week recognizes the multiple pathways a graduating senior has available including college enrollment, apprenticeship, and military enlistment. Graduating seniors will be celebrated equally no matter their chosen path; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House respectfully urges New Jersey high schools to create a Pathways to Purpose Week the week in which May 1 falls to recognize the options available to students post-graduation.  College enrollment has been historically honored as the successful path to take after high school, but solely focusing on this path leaves out those who do not pursue higher education. College should continue to be honored by schools alongside other paths, such as apprenticeships and military enlistment. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Commissioner of Education and the executive county superintendent of schools in each county of the State. STATEMENT This resolution urges New Jersey high schools to recognize the multiple pathways to success after graduation by creating a Pathways to Purpose Week.  This week is meant to expand upon the College Decision Days when many New Jersey high schools celebrate graduating seniors confirming enrollment into college.  A significant portion of high school students do not enroll in college immediately following high school, around 30 percent according to the most recently available Department of Education data.  The decision to pursue a path other than higher education after leaving high school can still be a successful one.  Apprenticeship and military service are two such paths for success that are available for young people to pursue and are worthy of recognition. Apprenticeships combine trade specific formal instruction and paid on-the-job training.  Military enlistment has a long term career option or a shorter period of active service with an avenue of subsidized higher education afterwards. This week highlights the numerous pathways to purpose available to both provide an example for younger students and those who have not yet chosen their path and to honor the graduating seniors who have mapped their plan.
