STATEMENT This concurrent resolution urges the President and Congress of the United States to enact the Eviction Crisis Act of 2019 and the Family Stability and Opportunity Vouchers Act of 2019, to ensure all families can live in an affordable, stable home. In the United States, three out of every four low income households in need of housing assistance are denied federal help due to chronic underfunding of federal assistance programs. Additionally, six million families with children lack stable housing, are at risk of losing their homes, or live in unsafe or overcrowded conditions. In 2016, 2.3 million eviction filings were made in courthouses across the United States and one in 50 renters was evicted from their home.  In 2017, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reported that more than eight million households with very low income pay more than 50 percent of their household income for housing costs, making it extremely difficult to pay for transportation, child-care, food, medical expenses, and other necessities. In 2018, over 150,000 New Jersey families faced eviction, and on average three out of four New Jersey families in poverty who rent spent at least half of their income on housing, leaving these families with little extra money for addressing unexpected expenses. The federal Eviction Crisis Act of 2019, a bi-partisan bill introduced by United States Senators Michael Bennett (D-Colo.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), addresses the national housing crisis crippling millions of Americans by improving data and analysis on evictions, reducing preventable evictions and eviction-related consequences, and improving information on tenant screening reports. The federal Family Stability and Opportunity Vouchers Act of 2019, a bi-partisan bill introduced by United States Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.), addresses the lack of housing vouchers available throughout the nation by creating an additional 500,000 housing vouchers over five years for low-income, high-need families with young children.
