AR76 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 76 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  JAY WEBBER District 26 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Requires certain bills and resolutions with at least 32 sponsors to be voted on third reading upon notice. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Assembly Resolution supplementing the Rules of the General Assembly to require certain bills and resolutions with at least 32 sponsors to be voted on third reading upon notice. Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  General Assembly Rule 15:30 is added as follows: 15:30. Minority Leader Bills and Resolutions The Minority Leader may designate three bills or resolutions each two-year legislative session which shall then be voted on third reading subject to the following provisions: a. The bill or resolution shall have at least 32 General Assembly sponsors or be a Senate bill or resolution, with the identical General Assembly bill or resolution having at least 32 sponsors. b. The first prime sponsor of the bill or resolution shall join the Minority Leader in designating the bill or resolution as requiring a vote on third reading pursuant to this rule. c. The Minority Leader shall provide a signed written notice, also signed by the first prime sponsor, to the Speaker and Clerk, designating the bill or resolution as requiring a vote on third reading pursuant to this rule.  The notice shall not be in order unless at least 45 days have passed since the bill received first reading, or, if on second reading, at least 45 days have passed since the bill received second reading.  In the case of identical bills or resolutions either the General Assembly or Senate bill or resolution may satisfy this requirement. d. The Clerk shall enter the notice in the Minutes of the General Assembly on the next day on which the General Assembly has a quorum present to do business.  The notice shall be effective as of that date. e. Once the notice is effective, the subject bill or resolution, if in committee, shall immediately be released from committee and returned to the General Assembly.  The bill or resolution shall not be subject to any motions, other than to substitute under Rule 15:20, the Identical Bill Rule, and to move the bill or resolution on third or final reading. f. Within 30 days of the effective date of the notice, a public hearing shall be held by the original reference committee or by another committee designated by the Speaker for this purpose on the subject bill or resolution.  However, the subject bill or resolution shall be considered a matter under investigation or study by the committee holding the hearing and shall not be referred to the committee.  The provisions of Rule 18:1, Public Hearings, shall apply to the hearing. g. The bill or resolution shall be on the calendar for the next meeting of the General Assembly at which bills or resolutions are considered on third or final reading, occurring more than five days after the public hearing.  The bill or resolution shall be the order of the day for that meeting of the General Assembly and shall be considered in preference to any other bills or resolutions on that day. h. The notice described in subsection c. may only be withdrawn by the Minority Leader.  If it is withdrawn after the public hearing held pursuant to subsection f., the subject bill or resolution shall count as one of the three bills or resolutions the Minority Leader may designate under this rule. 2.  This resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT In the republican form of government, the people delegate to the elected members of any legislative body the power to make policy.  The political majority of that body, having been chosen by the people, properly has the ability to enact policies consistent with its view of the mandate given by the people, and ultimately bears the responsibility for those policies and their consequences. However, all elected representatives, regardless of their political alignment or their standing with the prevailing majority of the legislative body, have the same duty to recommend solutions to the problems facing the people.  The people are best served when their representatives engage in a competition of ideas that results in a choice between workable alternatives. This resolution encourages the development and presentation of new ideas and policy choices by providing limited opportunity for those with the support of 40 percent of the General Assembly to be debated and put to an up-or-down vote. Section 1 of the resolution proposes a new rule: 15:30, Minority Leader Bills and Resolutions.  This rule authorizes the Minority Leader, with the consent of the prime sponsor of the bill or resolution, to designate up to three bills or resolutions which shall be voted on third reading.  In order to so designate a bill or resolution, there must be at least 32 sponsors, 40 percent of the General Assembly.  If the bill or resolution is a Senate bill or resolution there must be at least 32 sponsors of the identical General Assembly bill or resolution.  Sponsors include prime sponsors and co-sponsors. The Minority Leader designates a bill or resolution for a vote on third reading by providing a written notice, signed by the Minority Leader and first prime sponsor, to that effect to the Speaker and Clerk.  The notice shall be entered in the Minutes of the General Assembly and effective as of the next day on which the General Assembly has a quorum present.  For the notice to be in order the subject bill or resolution, if on first reading, must have been on first reading for at least 45 days, and if on second reading, must have been on second reading for at least 45 days. In the case of identical bills or resolutions, either the Senate or General Assembly bill or resolution may satisfy this provision.  A notice that is not in order shall be of no effect. Once the notice is effective, if the bill or resolution is in committee, it shall immediately be released by the committee and returned to the General Assembly.  This procedure shall operate automatically under this rule and shall not require a meeting or any action by the committee. As of the effective date of the notice, the bill or resolution is not subject to any motions other than to substitute under Rule 15:20, the identical bill rule, and to approve on third or final reading. Within 30 days of the effective date of the notice, a public hearing shall be held on the bill or resolution by the original reference committee or by another committee designated by the Speaker.  The bill or resolution shall be considered a matter under investigation or study by the committee holding the public hearing and shall not be referred to that committee.  Rule 18:1 applies to the public hearing. The bill or resolution shall be on the calendar for the next meeting of the General Assembly at which bills or resolutions are considered on third or final reading occurring more than five days after the public hearing. Only the Minority Leader may withdraw the notice designating the bill or resolution for third reading under this rule.  If that withdrawal occurs after the public hearing, the bill or resolution which is the subject of the withdrawn notice shall count as one of the three bills or resolutions allowed under this rule.  If the withdrawal of the notice occurs prior to the call to order of the public hearing, the subject bill or resolution shall not count as one of the three bills or resolutions under this rule.
