<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) a. The
Attorney General shall establish a grant program to provide financial
assistance to county and municipal law enforcement agencies to purchase and
install bullet-resistant windshields, side windows, rear windows, and door
panels for motor vehicles used by law enforcement officers while acting in the
performance of the officers official duties.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Attorney General
shall establish guidelines to implement the grant program, including, but not
limited to application procedures, eligibility criteria, the amount of each
grant, procedures for evaluating grant applications, and procedures for
monitoring the use of a grant provided under the grant program and ensuring
compliance with any conditions of the grant. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     There is created in the
Department of Law and Public Safety a nonlapsing revolving fund to be known as
the Bullet-Resistant Law Enforcement Motor Vehicles fund.  This fund shall be
the repository for moneys provided pursuant to subsection j. of R.S.39:5-41 and
shall be administered by the Attorney General.  Moneys deposited in the fund,
and any interest earned thereon, shall be used exclusively for the purpose of
making grants to county and municipal law enforcement agencies for the purchase
and installation of bullet-resistant components for motor vehicles pursuant to
subsection a. of this section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    R.S.39:5-41 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     39:5-41. a. All fines,
penalties and forfeitures imposed and collected under authority of law for any
violations of R.S.39:4-63 and R.S.39:4-64 shall be forwarded by the judge to
whom the same have been paid to the proper financial officer of a county, if
the violation occurred within the jurisdiction of that county's central
municipal court, established pursuant to N.J.S.2B:12-1 et seq. or the
municipality wherein the violation occurred, to be used by the county or
municipality to help finance litter control activities in addition to or
supplementing existing litter pickup and removal activities in the
municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Except as otherwise
provided by subsection a. of this section, all fines, penalties and forfeitures
imposed and collected under authority of law for any violations of the
provisions of this Title, other than those violations in which the complaining
witness is the chief administrator, a member of his staff, a member of the
State Police, a member of a county police department and force, a county park
police system, or a sheriff's office in a county that has established a central
municipal court, an inspector of the Board of Public Utilities, or a law
enforcement officer of any other State agency, shall be forwarded by the judge
to whom the same have been paid as follows: one-half of the total amount
collected to the financial officer, as designated by the local governing body,
of the respective municipalities wherein the violations occurred, to be used by
the municipality for general municipal use and to defray the cost of operating
the municipal court; and one-half of the total amount collected to the proper
financial officer of the county wherein they were collected, to be used by the
county as a fund for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair
of roads and bridges, snow removal, the acquisition and purchase of
rights-of-way, and the purchase, replacement and repair of equipment for use on
said roads and bridges therein.  Up to 25% of the money received by a
municipality pursuant to this subsection, but not more than the actual amount
budgeted for the municipal court, whichever is less, may be used to upgrade
case processing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All fines, penalties and
forfeitures imposed and collected under authority of law for any violations of
the provisions of this Title, in which the complaining witness is a member of a
county police department and force, a county park police system, or a county
sheriff's office in a county that has established a central municipal court,
shall be forwarded by the judge to whom the same have been paid to the
financial officer, designated by the governing body of the county, for all
violations occurring within the jurisdiction of that court, to be used for
general county use and to defray the cost of operating the central municipal
court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever any county has
deposited moneys collected pursuant to this section in a special trust fund in lieu
of expending the same for the purposes authorized by this section, it may
withdraw from said special trust fund in any year an amount which is not in
excess of the amount expended by the county over the immediately preceding
three-year period from general county revenues for said purposes. Such moneys
withdrawn from the trust fund shall be accounted for and used as are other
general county revenues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.1993, c.293.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsections a. and b. of this section, $1 shall be added to the
amount of each fine and penalty imposed and collected through a court under
authority of any law for any violation of the provisions of Title 39 of the
Revised Statutes or any other motor vehicle or traffic violation in this State
and shall be forwarded by the person to whom the same are paid to the State
Treasurer.  In addition, upon the forfeiture of bail, $1 of that forfeiture
shall be forwarded to the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall annually
deposit those moneys so forwarded in the &quot;Body Armor Replacement&quot;
fund established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1997, c.177 (C.52:17B-4.4). 
Beginning in the fiscal year next following the effective date of this act, the
State Treasurer annually shall allocate from those moneys so forwarded an
amount not to exceed $400,000 to the Department of the Treasury to be expended
exclusively for the purposes of funding the operation of the &quot;Law
Enforcement Officer Crisis Intervention Services&quot; telephone hotline established
and maintained under the provisions of sections 115 and 116 of P.L.2008, c.29
(C.26:2NN-1 and C.26:2NN-2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Notwithstanding the

Revised Statutes or any other motor vehicle or traffic violation in this State
