S3555 SENATE, No. 3555 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED SEPTEMBER 12, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  DECLAN J. O'SCANLON, JR. District 13 (Monmouth) SYNOPSIS Requires DOT to study use of zipper merge method on State roadways. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act requiring the Department of Transportation to conduct a study on the use of zipper merge method on State roadways. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  As used in this section: "Merge point" means the point at which two traffic lanes merge into one traffic lane. "Zipper merge method" means a method of merging vehicles at a merge point that involves the operators of the merging vehicles: (1) using both lanes of traffic until the vehicles reach the merge point; and (2) once the vehicles reach the merge point, alternating yielding the right-of-way into the single traffic lane. b.    No later than 30 days after the effective date of this act, the Department of Transportation shall commence a year-long study on the any usage of the zipper merge method and its effectiveness in reducing congestion and improving traffic flow on roads where construction or infrastructure projects are taking place, causing the closure of one or more lanes. c. The study shall, at a minimum: (1)   review any existing research and studies on the zipper merge method conducted by other states or transportation agencies; (2)   evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of implementing the zipper merge method on roads where construction or other infrastructure projects are taking place, causing the closure of one or more lanes; (3)   analyze the impact of the zipper merge method on traffic safety and the potential for reducing accidents and conflicts; and (4)   identify any necessary infrastructure modifications or signage requirements for the implementation of the zipper merge method. d.    If the findings of the study conducted pursuant to section support the implementation of the zipper merge method, the Department of Transportation shall develop a plan for implementing the zipper merge method on State roadways where construction or infrastructure projects are taking place causing a the closure of one or more lanes. e. No later than six months after the completion of the study pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the department shall prepare and submit a report to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature, containing the studys findings and, if the studys findings support the implementation of the zipper merge method, the plan developed by the department pursuant to subsection d. of this section. 2. This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire upon submission of the report required by section 1 of this act. STATEMENT This bill requires the Department of Transportation (department), within 30 days of the bills effective date, to commence a year-long study on the usage of the zipper merge method and its effectiveness in reducing congestion and improving traffic flow on roads where construction or infrastructure projects are taking place, causing the closure of one or more lanes. Under the bill, the study is to include, at a minimum: (1) a review of existing research and studies on the zipper merge method conducted by other states or transportation agencies; (2) an evaluation of the feasibility and potential benefits of implementing the zipper merge method on roads where construction or other infrastructure projects are taking place, causing the closure of one or more lanes; (3) an analysis of the impact of the zipper merge method on traffic safety and the potential for reducing accidents and conflicts; and (4) an identification of any necessary infrastructure modifications or signage requirements for the implementation of the zipper merge method.  If the studys findings support the implementation of the zipper merge method, the department is required to develop a plan for implementing the zipper merge method on State roadways where construction or infrastructure projects are taking place, causing the closure of one or more lanes. The bill also requires the department to prepare and submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature within six months after completion of the study.  The report is to include the studys findings and, if the studys findings support the implementation of the zipper merge method, the plan developed by the department under the bill. The bill defines "zipper merge method" as a method of merging vehicles at a merge point that involves the operators of the merging vehicles: (1) using both lanes of traffic until the vehicles reach the merge point; and (2) once the vehicles reach the merge point, alternating yielding the right-of-way into the single traffic lane.  In addition, the bill defines merge point as the point at which two traffic lanes merge into one traffic lane.
