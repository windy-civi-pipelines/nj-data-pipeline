<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Within 30 days after an
appraisal is filed, the parties may file objections with the special master.</p>

appraisal, the special master may consider any other evidence offered by a
party.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If all cotenants have
agreed to the value of the property or to another method of valuation, the special

this act, the party filing the partition action shall send written notice to
the parties and the special master within 30 days that any cotenant, except a
cotenant that requested partition by sale, may buy all of the interests of the
cotenants that requested partition by sale.</p>

each of the interests of a cotenant that requested partition by sale is the
value of the entire parcel determined under section 6 of this act multiplied by
the cotenants fractional ownership of the entire parcel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    After expiration of the
buyout notice period set in subsection b. of this section, the following shall
apply:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   If only one cotenant
elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by
sale, the cotenant shall notify all the parties and the special master in
writing of that fact.</p>

cotenant elects to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested

existing fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided by the total
existing fractional ownership of all cotenants electing to buy, and send
written notice to all the parties of that fact and of the price to be paid by
each electing cotenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If no cotenant elects to
buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale, the special

court shall resolve the partition action, by order, in accordance with
subsections a. and b. of section 8 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     If the parties under
paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection d. of this section elect to buy all the
interests, the cotenants shall be required to pay their apportioned price within
60 days to the Superior Court Trust Fund, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Rules of Court. After this date, the following shall apply:</p>

entitled to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   If no electing cotenant
timely pays its apportioned price, the special master shall report to the court

not purchased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If one or more but not
all of the electing cotenants fail to pay their apportioned price on time, the
electing cotenants that paid their apportioned price of the interest may file a
motion with the special master to determine the remaining interests and prices.

following any order of the special master entered pursuant to paragraph (3) of
subsection e. of this section, any cotenant that paid may elect to purchase all
of the remaining interest by paying the entire price with notice to the special
master. After this date, the following shall apply:</p>

act as if the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale were
not purchased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If more than one
cotenant pays the entire price for the remaining interests, the special master
shall reapportion the remaining interests among those paying cotenants, based
on each paying cotenants original fractional ownership of the entire parcel
divided by the total original fractional ownership of all cotenants that paid
the entire price for the remaining interests.  The special master shall report
to the court in writing with written notice to the parties. The court shall
issue an order reallocating all of the cotenants interests and requiring
refund of any excess payments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Not later than 30 days
after notices have been sent pursuant to subsection a. of this section, any
cotenant entitled to buy an interest under this section may request the special
master to authorize the sale as part of the pending action of the interests of
cotenants named as defendants and served with the complaint but that did not
appear in the action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    If the special master
receives a timely request under subsection g. of this section, the special
master, after a hearing, may deny the request or authorize the requested
additional sale on terms as the special master determines are fair and
reasonable, subject to the following limitations:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A sale authorized under
this subsection may occur only after the purchase prices for all interests
subject to sale under subsections a. through f. of this section have been paid
into the Superior Court Trust Fund and those interests have been reallocated
among the cotenants as provided in those subsections. Any funds deposited into
the Trust Fund pursuant to this section shall be distributed in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Rules of Court; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The purchase price for
the interest of a non-appearing cotenant is based on the special masters
determination of value under section 6 of this act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    a.  If all the interests
of all cotenants that requested partition by sale are not purchased by other
cotenants pursuant to section 7 of this act, or if after conclusion of the
buyout period under that section, a cotenant remains that has requested
partition in kind, the special master shall report to the court recommending
partition in kind. The court shall order partition in kind, unless the court,
after consideration of the factors listed in section 9 of this act, finds that
partition in kind will result in great prejudice to the cotenants as a group. 
In considering whether to order partition in kind, the court shall approve a
request by two or more parties to have their individual interests aggregated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If the court does not
order partition in kind under subsection a. of this section, the court shall
order partition by sale pursuant to section 10 of this act or, if no cotenant
requested partition by sale, the court shall dismiss the action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If the court orders
partition in kind pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the court may
require that one or more cotenants pay one or more other cotenants amounts so
that the payments, taken together with the value of the in-kind distributions
to the cotenants, make the partition in kind just and proportionate in value to
the fractional interests held.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    If the court orders
partition in kind pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the court shall
allocate to the cotenants that are unknown, un-locatable, or the subject of a
default judgment, if their interests were not bought out pursuant to section 7
of this act, a part of the property representing the combined interests of
these cotenants as determined by the court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.    a.  In determining under
subsection a. of section 8 of this act whether partition in kind would result
in great prejudice to the cotenants as a group, the court shall consider the
following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Whether the heirs
property practicably can be divided among the cotenants;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Whether partition in
kind would apportion the property in a way that the aggregate fair market value
of the parcels resulting from the division would be materially less than the
value of the property if it were sold as a whole, taking into account the
condition under which a court-ordered sale likely would occur;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Evidence of the
collective duration of ownership or possession of the property by a cotenant
and one or more predecessors in title or predecessors in possession to the
cotenant who are or were relatives of the cotenant or each other;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A cotenants sentimental
attachment to the property, including any attachment arising because the
property has ancestral or other unique or special value to the cotenant;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   The lawful use being
made of the property by a cotenant and the degree to which the cotenant would
be harmed if the cotenant could not continue the same use of the property;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The degree to which the
cotenants have contributed their pro rata share of the property taxes,

property or have contributed to the physical improvement, maintenance, or
upkeep of the property; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   any other relevant
factor as determined by the court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The court may not

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  a.  If the court orders a

open-market sale and the parties, not later than 10 days after the entry of the

property for sale, the court shall appoint the broker and establish a
reasonable commission.  If the parties do not agree on a broker, the court
shall appoint a disinterested real estate broker licensed in this State to
offer the property for sale and shall establish a reasonable commission.  The
broker shall offer the property for sale in a commercially reasonable manner at

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, titled the Uniform
Partition of Heirs Property Act, would provide an alternative process for
handling partition actions filed in court concerning real property with
multiple owners, at least one of whom had acquired title to the property from a
relative.  The bill is based on the 2010 uniform act of the same name drafted
and approved by the Uniform Law Commission (formerly known, and sometimes still
referred to, as the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State
Laws). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, any real property
held by multiple owners as tenants in common (cotenants) may be subject to a
partition action filed in Superior Court, which may result in (1) a partition
in kind, which is the physical division of the property proportionate to
individual owners interests, or (2) partition by sale, for which individual owners
are then compensated out of the total purchase price proportionate to their
interests.  <u>See</u> N.J.S.2A:56-1 et seq.  This bill would preempt some
parts of the existing partition law in order to create new requirements for the
process intended to more greatly protect the interests of cotenant property
owners who may object to another owners action seeking to partition any
property which meets the following characteristics and is referred to in the
bill as heirs property:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     - there is no agreement in a
record binding all the cotenants which governs the partition of the property;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     - one or more of the cotenants
acquired title from a relative, whether living or deceased; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     - any one of the following
applies: 20 percent or more of the interests are held by cotenants who are
relatives; 20 percent or more of the interests are held by an individual who
acquired title from a relative, whether living or deceased; or 20 percent or
more of the cotenants are relatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     When a partition action is
filed pursuant to the partition law, N.J.S.2A:56-1 et seq., the court would
make a determination, based on information contained in the pleadings or any
other information provided to the court pursuant to the Rules of Court, whether
the subject property is heirs property.  If so determined, the property would
be partitioned in accordance with the process set forth in the bill.  The court
is to appoint a special master to generally oversee the process and, when
appropriate to carry out a partition in kind (the physical division of
property), and may, when appropriate, appoint a commissioner or commissioners
pursuant R.4:63-1 of the Rules of Court to ascertain and report in writing the
metes and bounds of each [cotenants] share.  Any such appointed commissioner
would be required to be disinterested, impartial, and not a party to or
participant in the partition action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that if
the court determines that the property may be heirs property, the court would
order the plaintiff to post, and maintain while the action is pending, a
conspicuous notice on the property that is the subject of the action in
accordance with the Rules of Court.  That notice would state information about
the partition action and the common designation by which the property is known,
and the court could also require the party to include the partys name and the
known defendants (other cotenants).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An appointed special master
would direct a disinterested real estate appraiser licensed in the State to
make a determination of the propertys fair market value, assuming sole
ownership of the fee simple estate, unless the cotenants have agreed to the
propertys value or to another valuation method, in which case the special
master could accept that value or the value produced by the agreed upon
method.  If an appraisal was conducted, the completed appraisal would be
distributed to the parties in the action and filed with the special master. 
Within 30 days after the appraisal is filed, any party could file an objection
with the special master.  Thereafter, following notice of a hearing, the
special master could conduct an appraisal hearing to determine the fair market
value of the property, during which the special master could consider evidence
offered by any party in addition to the real estate appraisal on file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If any cotenant requests a
partition by sale, after the determination of the propertys value, a notice
would be sent within 45 days by the party who filed the partition action to all
parties and the special master indicating that any cotenant, except a cotenant
that requested partition by sale, could buy all of the interests of the one or
more cotenants requesting the sale.  Within 30 days thereafter, any eligible
cotenant or cotenants could then elect to buy all of those interests by giving
notice of such to the parties and the special master.  The purchase price for
each of the interests of a cotenant requesting the partition by sale would be
the determined value of the entire parcel of property multiplied by the
cotenants fractional ownership of the entire parcel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At the conclusion of the
buyout notice period, the bill provides for the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  If only one cotenant
elected to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by
sale, the cotenant would notify all the parties and the special master in
writing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   If more than one
cotenant elected to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested
partition by sale, the special master would allocate the right to buy those
interests among the electing cotenants based on each electing cotenants
existing fractional ownership of the entire parcel divided by the total
existing fractional ownership of all cotenants electing to buy, and send
written notice to all the parties of that fact and of the price to be paid by
each electing cotenant; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If no cotenant elected
to buy all the interests of the cotenants that requested partition by sale, the
special master with notice to the parties would report in writing to the court,
and the court would resolve the matter by ordering a partition in kind or
partition by sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In situations when one or more
cotenants elected to buy the available interests, each such cotenant would be
required to pay their apportioned price within 30 days with notice to the
special master.  Upon timely payment by all purchasing cotenants, the special
master would issue an order reallocating the interests amongst the remaining
cotenants and the money held by the Superior Court Trust Fund would be
disbursed, in accordance with procedures set forth in the Rules of Court, to
the one or more cotenants who have been bought-out.  If no one made timely
payments, the special master would report this to the court, which in turn
would resolve the matter by ordering a partition in kind or partition by sale. 
If only some made timely payments, those paying cotenants could file a motion
with the special master to determine the outstanding interests and their
purchase price, and one or more such cotenants could thereafter pay, based upon
a new special master order, for the recalculated remaining interests within 30
days following issuance of the order.  After this new 30-day period, if there
remained any interests for sale that are not purchased, the court would resolve
the matter by ordering a partition in kind or partition by sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Thus, whenever at the
conclusion of the one or more buyout periods described above there remain any
unpurchased interest from a cotenant that requested the partition by sale, or
any cotenant remains that has requested a partition in kind, the special master
would report to the court a recommendation to proceed with a partition in
kind.  The court would order the partitioning of the property into physically
distinct and separately titled parcels, unless the court found that such
partitioning would result in great prejudice to the cotenants as a group; the
determination of great prejudice would be based on such factors as whether
the property could be divided practicably amongst cotenants, whether doing so
could decrease the aggregate values of the resulting parcels versus selling the
property as a whole, and any cotenants sentimental attachment to the property,
including attachment arising because of any ancestral, unique, or special value
to the cotenant.  In a case in which a partition in kind would result in great
prejudice, the court would order a partition by sale, unless no cotenant
requested such action, resulting in the dismissal of the case and no further
partitioning of the property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any partition by sale would be
an open-market sale unless the court finds that a sale by sealed bids or an
auction would be more economically advantageous and in the best interest of the
cotenants as a group.  Any open-market sale would proceed under a licensed real
estate broker, either agreed to by the parties or, absent agreement, appointed
by the court.  The real estate broker would be provided a reasonable commission
on the sale as determined by the court.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The broker would offer the
property for sale in a commercially reasonable manner at a price no lower than
the previously determined value of the property, and on the terms and
conditions established by the court.  The broker, after receiving an offer to
purchase the property, would file a report with the court containing information
about the purchase price, name of each buyer, terms of the proposed sale,
including the terms of any financing, any amounts to be paid to lienholders,
and other material facts relevant to the sale.  Thereafter, the purchase could
be completed in accordance with applicable State law and payments distributed
based upon the former cotenants various interests in the property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would take effect on
the 30th day following enactment, and apply to any partition actions filed on
or after that date.</p>
