parole.  This bill would restore the death penalty for persons convicted of
certain murders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a person who committed
the homicidal act by his own conduct, or, as an accomplice procured the
commission of the offense by payment or promise of payment of anything of
pecuniary value, could be sentenced to death if: (1) the victim was a law
enforcement officer or correction officer and was murdered while performing his
official duties or was murdered because of his status as a law enforcement
officer or correction officer; (2) the victim was less than 18 years old; or (3)
the murder occurred during the commission of the crime of terrorism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, as under prior
law, a defendant found guilty of capital murder could be sentenced to death
only after a second proceeding concerning sentencing. During the sentencing
proceeding, the jury or the court would weigh the aggravating factors of the
case against the mitigating factors in order to determine whether the defendant
would receive a sentence of death. The aggravating factors would consist of the
following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The defendant has been
convicted, at any time, of another murder;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   In the commission of the
murder, the defendant purposely or knowingly created a grave risk of death to
another person in addition to the victim;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   The murder was
outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture,
depravity of mind, or an aggravated assault to the victim;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   The defendant committed
the murder as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt
of anything of pecuniary value;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   The defendant procured
the commission of the murder by payment or promise of payment of anything of
pecuniary value;</p>

for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, punishment or
confinement for another offense committed by the defendant or another;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   The murder was committed
while the defendant was engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit,
or flight after committing or attempting to commit murder, robbery, sexual
assault, arson, burglary, kidnapping, carjacking or the crime of contempt in
violation of the N.J.S.A.2C:29-9 b. (concerning domestic violence);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)   The defendant murdered a
public servant while the victim was engaged in the performance of his official
duties, or because of the victim's status as a public servant;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    The defendant: (i) as a
leader of a narcotics trafficking network and in furtherance of a conspiracy
committed, commanded or by threat or promise solicited the commission of the
murder or (ii) committed the murder at the direction of a leader of a narcotics
trafficking network in furtherance of a conspiracy;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (j)    The homicidal act that
the defendant committed or procured was in violation of paragraph (1) of
subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:17-2 (causing widespread injury or damage);</p>

committed during the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after
committing or attempting to commit, terrorism.</p>

mitigating factors would consist of the following:</p>

the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to
constitute a defense to prosecution;</p>

to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the
requirements of the law was significantly impaired as the result of mental
disease or defect or intoxication, but not to a degree sufficient to constitute
a defense to prosecution;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   The defendant was under
unusual and substantial duress insufficient to constitute a defense to
prosecution;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   The defendant has no
significant history of prior criminal activity;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   The defendant rendered
substantial assistance to the State in the prosecution of another person for
the crime of murder; or</p>

is relevant to the defendant's character or record or to the circumstances of
the offense.</p>
