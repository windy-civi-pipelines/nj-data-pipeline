(f)   Evidence offered by the State with regard to the establishment of a prior homicide conviction pursuant to paragraph (4)(a) of this subsection may include the identity and age of the victim, the manner of death and the relationship, if any, of the victim to the defendant. (3)   The jury or, if there is no jury, the court shall return a special verdict setting forth in writing the existence or nonexistence of each of the aggravating and mitigating factors set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection.  If any aggravating factor is found to exist, the verdict shall also state whether it outweighs beyond a reasonable doubt any one or more mitigating factors.

(4)   The aggravating factors which may be found by the jury or the court are: (a)   The defendant has been convicted, at any time, of another murder. For purposes of this section, a conviction shall be deemed final when sentence is imposed and may be used as an aggravating factor regardless of whether it is on appeal; (b)   In the commission of the murder, the defendant purposely or knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim; (c)   The murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated assault to the victim; (d)   The defendant committed the murder as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt of anything of pecuniary value; (e)   The defendant procured the commission of the murder by payment or promise of payment of anything of pecuniary value; (f)   The murder was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, punishment or confinement for another offense committed by the defendant or another; (g)   The murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit murder, robbery, sexual assault, arson, burglary, kidnapping, carjacking  or the crime of contempt in violation of N.J.S.2C:29-9b.; (h)   The defendant murdered a public servant, as defined in N.J.S.2C:27-1, while the victim was engaged in the performance of his official duties, or because of the victim's status as a public servant; (i)    The defendant:  (i) as a leader of a narcotics trafficking network as defined in N.J.S.2C:35-3 and in furtherance of a conspiracy enumerated in N.J.S.2C:35-3, committed, commanded or by threat or promise solicited the commission of the murder or (ii) committed the murder  at the direction of a leader of a narcotics trafficking network as defined in N.J.S.2C:35-3 in furtherance of a conspiracy enumerated in N.J.S.2C:35-3; (j)    The homicidal act that the defendant committed or procured was in violation of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:17-2; (k)   The victim was less than 14 years old; or (l)    The murder  was committed during the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit, terrorism pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2002, c.26 (C.2C:38-2). (5)   The mitigating factors which may be found by the jury or the court are: (a)   The defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a defense to prosecution; (b)   The victim solicited, participated in or consented to the conduct which resulted in his death; (c)   The age of the defendant at the time of the murder; (d)   The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was significantly impaired as the result of mental disease or defect or intoxication, but not to a degree sufficient to constitute a defense to prosecution; (e)   The defendant was under unusual and substantial duress insufficient to constitute a defense to prosecution; (f)   The defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity; (g)   The defendant rendered substantial assistance to the State in the prosecution of another person for the crime of murder; or (h)   Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's character or record or to the circumstances of the offense. (6)   When a defendant at a sentencing proceeding presents evidence of the defendant's character or record pursuant to subparagraph (h) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the State may present evidence of the murder victim's character and background and of the impact of the murder on the victim's survivors.  If the jury finds that the State has proven at least one aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt and the jury finds the existence of a mitigating factor pursuant to subparagraph (h) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the jury may consider the victim and survivor evidence presented by the State pursuant to this paragraph in determining the appropriate weight to give mitigating evidence presented pursuant to subparagraph (h) of paragraph (5) of this subsection.  As used in this paragraph victim and survivor evidence may include the display of a photograph of the victim taken before the homicide. l.     The sentencing proceeding set forth in subsection k. of this section shall not be waived by the prosecuting attorney. m.   Every judgment of conviction which results in a sentence of death under this section shall be appealed, pursuant to the Rules of Court, to the Supreme Court.  Upon the request of the defendant, the Supreme Court shall also determine whether the sentence is disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.  Proportionality review under this section shall be limited to a comparison of similar cases in which a sentence of death has been imposed under subsection k. of this section. In any instance in which the defendant fails, or refuses to appeal, the appeal shall be taken by the Office of the Public Defender or other counsel appointed by the Supreme Court for that purpose. n.    Prior to the jury's sentencing deliberations, the trial court shall inform the jury of the sentences which may be imposed pursuant to subsection b. of this section on the defendant if the defendant is not sentenced to death.  The jury shall also be informed that a failure to reach a unanimous verdict shall result in sentencing by the court pursuant to subsection b. o.    A juvenile who has been tried as an adult and convicted of murder shall not be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of subsection k. but shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of subsection b. of this section. p.    In a sentencing proceeding conducted pursuant to this section, no evidence shall be admissible concerning the method or manner of execution which would be imposed on a defendant sentenced to death. (cf: P.L.2017, c.150, s.1) 4.    Section 2 of P.L.2007, c.204 (C.2C:11-3b) is amended to read as follows: 2.    An inmate sentenced to death prior to the date of the enactment of [this act] P.L.2007, c.204, upon motion to the sentencing court and waiver of any further appeals related to sentencing, shall be resentenced to a term of life imprisonment during which the defendant shall not be eligible for parole. Such sentence shall be served in a maximum security prison. Any such motion to the sentencing court shall be made within 60 days of the enactment of this act.  If the motion is not made within 60 days the inmate shall remain under the sentence of death previously imposed by the sentencing court.

If the body is not demanded or requested by a relative or bona fide friend within 72 hours after execution then it shall be delivered to a duly authorized and incorporated pathological and anatomical association in the State, if requested by an authorized association. If the body is requested by a relative or bona fide friend, the State shall pay a fee, not to exceed $25 to the mortician for his services in embalming the body for which the mortician shall issue to the State a written receipt. If the body is requested by a duly authorized and incorporated pathological and anatomical association, the association shall pay a fee, not to exceed $25 to the mortician for his services in embalming the body for which the mortician shall issue to the association a written receipt. When the receipt is delivered to the commissioner, the body of the deceased shall be delivered to the party named in the receipt or his authorized agent. b.    If the body is not delivered to a relative, bona fide friend, or a duly authorized and incorporated pathological and anatomical association, the commissioner shall cause the body to be decently buried, and the fee for embalming shall be paid by the State, and no religious or other services shall be held over the body after the execution, except within the facility selected for the execution by the department, and no one shall be present at the service except the officers of the prison, the person conducting the services and relatives by blood or marriage of the person executed. c.     The commissioner shall contact the Social Security Administration, Veterans' Administration, Public Welfare, and appropriate insurance companies for any possible death benefits to offset the State incurred burial expenses. The inmate's account may also be used for burial expenses. 14.  (New section)  a.  If there is reasonable ground to believe that a female inmate, sentenced to the punishment of death, is pregnant, the superintendent of the State institution having custody of the inmate shall impanel a jury of three licensed physicians to inquire into her pregnancy. A physician acting as a juror upon this inquisition need not be qualified to serve as a juror in a court of record. b.    The inquisition of the jury shall be signed by the jurors and the superintendent of the institution. If it is found by the jury that the inmate is pregnant, the superintendent shall suspend the execution of the warrant directing her execution until he receives a warrant from the commissioner directing that the convict be executed. c.     The superintendent shall immediately transmit the inquisition to the commissioner, who, as soon as he is satisfied that the inmate is no longer pregnant, shall issue his warrant, appointing a time and place for her execution, pursuant to her sentence. 15.  (New section) The department may adopt any rules or regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this amendatory and supplementary act. 16.  (New section) The Judiciary Committee of the General Assembly and the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, or their respective successors, are constituted a joint committee for the purposes of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the implementation of this act. The Commissioner of the Department of Corrections shall, two years from the effective date of this act, report to the joint committee, an evaluation of the effectiveness of this act and the joint committee shall, upon receiving the report, issue as it may deem necessary and proper, recommendations for administrative or legislative changes affecting the implementation of this act. 17.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall be applicable to any murder committed on or after the effective date. STATEMENT P.L.2007, c.204, enacted on December 17, 2007, repealed the death penalty in this State and replaced it with life without parole.  This bill would restore the death penalty for persons convicted of certain murders. Under the bill, a person who committed the homicidal act by his own conduct, or, as an accomplice procured the commission of the offense by payment or promise of payment of anything of pecuniary value, could be sentenced to death if: (1) the victim was a law enforcement officer or correction officer and was murdered while performing his official duties or was murdered because of his status as a law enforcement officer or correction officer; (2) the victim was less than 18 years old; or (3) the murder occurred during the commission of the crime of terrorism. Under the bill, as under prior law, a defendant found guilty of capital murder could be sentenced to death only after a second proceeding concerning sentencing. During the sentencing proceeding, the jury or the court would weigh the aggravating factors of the case against the mitigating factors in order to determine whether the defendant would receive a sentence of death. The aggravating factors would consist of the following: (a)   The defendant has been convicted, at any time, of another murder; (b)   In the commission of the murder, the defendant purposely or knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim; (c)   The murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated assault to the victim; (d)   The defendant committed the murder as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt of anything of pecuniary value; (e)   The defendant procured the commission of the murder by payment or promise of payment of anything of pecuniary value; (f)   The murder was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, punishment or confinement for another offense committed by the defendant or another; (g)   The murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit murder, robbery, sexual assault, arson, burglary, kidnapping, carjacking or the crime of contempt in violation of the N.J.S.A.2C:29-9 b. (concerning domestic violence); (h)   The defendant murdered a public servant while the victim was engaged in the performance of his official duties, or because of the victim's status as a public servant; (i)    The defendant: (i) as a leader of a narcotics trafficking network and in furtherance of a conspiracy committed, commanded or by threat or promise solicited the commission of the murder or (ii) committed the murder at the direction of a leader of a narcotics trafficking network in furtherance of a conspiracy; (j)    The homicidal act that the defendant committed or procured was in violation of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:17-2 (causing widespread injury or damage); (k)   The victim was less than 14 years old; or (l)    The murder  was committed during the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit, terrorism. As under prior law, the mitigating factors would consist of the following: (a)   The defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a defense to prosecution; (b)   The victim solicited, participated in or consented to the conduct which resulted in his death; (c)   The age of the defendant at the time of the murder; (d)   The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was significantly impaired as the result of mental disease or defect or intoxication, but not to a degree sufficient to constitute a defense to prosecution; (e)   The defendant was under unusual and substantial duress insufficient to constitute a defense to prosecution; (f)   The defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity; (g)   The defendant rendered substantial assistance to the State in the prosecution of another person for the crime of murder; or (h)   Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.

A physician acting as a juror upon this inquisition need not be qualified to serve as a juror in a court of record. b.    The inquisition of the jury shall be signed by the jurors and the superintendent of the institution. If it is found by the jury that the inmate is pregnant, the superintendent shall suspend the execution of the warrant directing her execution until he receives a warrant from the commissioner directing that the convict be executed. c.     The superintendent shall immediately transmit the inquisition to the commissioner, who, as soon as he is satisfied that the inmate is no longer pregnant, shall issue his warrant, appointing a time and place for her execution, pursuant to her sentence. 15.  (New section) The department may adopt any rules or regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this amendatory and supplementary act. 16.  (New section) The Judiciary Committee of the General Assembly and the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, or their respective successors, are constituted a joint committee for the purposes of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the implementation of this act.

STATEMENT P.L.2007, c.204, enacted on December 17, 2007, repealed the death penalty in this State and replaced it with life without parole.  This bill would restore the death penalty for persons convicted of certain murders. Under the bill, a person who committed the homicidal act by his own conduct, or, as an accomplice procured the commission of the offense by payment or promise of payment of anything of pecuniary value, could be sentenced to death if: (1) the victim was a law enforcement officer or correction officer and was murdered while performing his official duties or was murdered because of his status as a law enforcement officer or correction officer; (2) the victim was less than 18 years old; or (3) the murder occurred during the commission of the crime of terrorism. Under the bill, as under prior law, a defendant found guilty of capital murder could be sentenced to death only after a second proceeding concerning sentencing. During the sentencing proceeding, the jury or the court would weigh the aggravating factors of the case against the mitigating factors in order to determine whether the defendant would receive a sentence of death. The aggravating factors would consist of the following: (a)   The defendant has been convicted, at any time, of another murder; (b)   In the commission of the murder, the defendant purposely or knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim; (c)   The murder was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated assault to the victim; (d)   The defendant committed the murder as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt of anything of pecuniary value; (e)   The defendant procured the commission of the murder by payment or promise of payment of anything of pecuniary value; (f)   The murder was committed for the purpose of escaping detection, apprehension, trial, punishment or confinement for another offense committed by the defendant or another; (g)   The murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit murder, robbery, sexual assault, arson, burglary, kidnapping, carjacking or the crime of contempt in violation of the N.J.S.A.2C:29-9 b. (concerning domestic violence); (h)   The defendant murdered a public servant while the victim was engaged in the performance of his official duties, or because of the victim's status as a public servant; (i)    The defendant: (i) as a leader of a narcotics trafficking network and in furtherance of a conspiracy committed, commanded or by threat or promise solicited the commission of the murder or (ii) committed the murder at the direction of a leader of a narcotics trafficking network in furtherance of a conspiracy; (j)    The homicidal act that the defendant committed or procured was in violation of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:17-2 (causing widespread injury or damage); (k)   The victim was less than 14 years old; or (l)    The murder  was committed during the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit, terrorism. As under prior law, the mitigating factors would consist of the following: (a)   The defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a defense to prosecution; (b)   The victim solicited, participated in or consented to the conduct which resulted in his death; (c)   The age of the defendant at the time of the murder; (d)   The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was significantly impaired as the result of mental disease or defect or intoxication, but not to a degree sufficient to constitute a defense to prosecution; (e)   The defendant was under unusual and substantial duress insufficient to constitute a defense to prosecution; (f)   The defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity; (g)   The defendant rendered substantial assistance to the State in the prosecution of another person for the crime of murder; or (h)   Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
