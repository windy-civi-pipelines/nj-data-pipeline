Title 48 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      1.   a. 
The Legislature finds and declares that:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (1) 
The efforts taken to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
have resulted in residents, especially students, and certain businesses in this
State being required to perform their day-to-day activities from home or
otherwise from a remote location, and with many schools engaged in remote
learning, it is especially important for students and educators to have
Internet access suitable for their needs;          (2)      Telehealth
services, which are accessed through the Internet, offered to the public prior
to and during the pandemic will continue to help improve equitable access to
healthcare;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (3)  To
properly perform telehealth services, remote student learning, and other
activities during the pandemic, students, workers, and employers are required
to have access to Internet service at broadband speeds to transmit data,
graphics, video, and voice communications quickly and efficiently; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (4)  To
document and quantify the extent of the provision of broadband Internet
(broadband) service deployment in the United States, twice a year, the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) requires all broadband service providers
(providers) to file Form 477 with the FCC, on which providers indicate where
they offer service at speeds exceeding 200 kilobits per second in at least one
direction, the minimum speed to be deemed as offering broadband service; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (5)  <span
style='color:black'>Presently, the FCC's method in determining broadband availability,
as determined by the information offered on Form 477, requires a provider to measure
coverage by census block, which means that some of the people within that area</span></span><b>
</b><span style='color:black;letter-spacing:0pt'>may not have access to
broadband service;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (6)  The
FCCs website confirms the potential for inaccuracy in this methodology by
stating that, [p]roviders may not offer service to every home in every
[census] block in which they report service. The calculationstreat every
location as having service, and may therefore over-estimate broadband coverage,
particularly in areas with large census blocks;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      (7)  In March 2020, Congress passed the Broadband
DATA Act, Pub.L.116-130, which requires the FCC to collect granular service</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>availability data from wired, fixed wireless, and satellite
broadband providers, and to create maps based on this information. The FCC has
already implemented many of the Broadband DATA Acts requirements, and, on July
16, 2020, it released a report and order<i> </i>to implement collection and
verification requirements for fixed and mobile broadband service availability
and quality of service data.  </span><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Even
under the FCCs implementation of the Broadband DATA Act, providers are
required to submit advertised broadband speed and not the actual speed that
customers receive;</span><b><sup> </sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      </span>(8)<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>  In 2018, a study by the Microsoft Corporation
found that 162.8 million people in this country are not using the Internet at
broadband speeds, which far exceeds the FCCs estimated number of people
without broadband service access at 25 million, a number determined by the data
reported from Form 477;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      </span>(9) 
<span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>A 2019 Pew Research Center survey found that
only 73 percent of American adults had high-speed Internet access at home and
this figure was even lower in rural areas and low-income areas;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      </span>(10)<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>  Having accurate information concerning broadband
service connectivity in this State is necessary to determine how to better
focus resources on providing broadband</span><b> </b><span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>access to all areas in New Jersey;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      </span>(11)<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>  Disadvantaged </span>households<b><sup> </sup></b><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>in New Jersey do not have the means to pay for
broadband service because of the high costs associated with maintaining the
service;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>      </b>(12)<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>  A significant amount of residents and small
businesses located in rural areas of this State do not have access to broadband
service;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      </span>(13)<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>   COVID-19 has exposed the digital divide in this
State, making it difficult for rural and low-income areas to access medical
care, continue education, and maintain employment; and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      </span>(14)<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>   This lack of access exacerbates social, economic,
income, and health inequities in this State that can be addressed by taking
measures that secure broadband access for areas in need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      b.   The
Legislature therefore determines that: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (1)  It
shall be the public policy of this State to foster the provision of wired broadband
