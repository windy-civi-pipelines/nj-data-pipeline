S2213 SENATE, No. 2213 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  M. TERESA RUIZ District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Senator  ANDREW ZWICKER District 16 (Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset) SYNOPSIS Establishes office in EDA to assist in provision and expansion of broadband Internet service in State to address inequities in accessing broadband service. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning broadband Internet service and supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.   a. The Legislature finds and declares that: (1) The efforts taken to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have resulted in residents, especially students, and certain businesses in this State being required to perform their day-to-day activities from home or otherwise from a remote location, and with many schools engaged in remote learning, it is especially important for students and educators to have Internet access suitable for their needs;          (2)      Telehealth services, which are accessed through the Internet, offered to the public prior to and during the pandemic will continue to help improve equitable access to healthcare; (3)  To properly perform telehealth services, remote student learning, and other activities during the pandemic, students, workers, and employers are required to have access to Internet service at broadband speeds to transmit data, graphics, video, and voice communications quickly and efficiently; (4)  To document and quantify the extent of the provision of broadband Internet (broadband) service deployment in the United States, twice a year, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires all broadband service providers (providers) to file Form 477 with the FCC, on which providers indicate where they offer service at speeds exceeding 200 kilobits per second in at least one direction, the minimum speed to be deemed as offering broadband service; (5)  Presently, the FCC's method in determining broadband availability, as determined by the information offered on Form 477, requires a provider to measure coverage by census block, which means that some of the people within that area may not have access to broadband service; (6)  The FCCs website confirms the potential for inaccuracy in this methodology by stating that, [p]roviders may not offer service to every home in every [census] block in which they report service. The calculations treat every location as having service, and may therefore over-estimate broadband coverage, particularly in areas with large census blocks; (7)  In March 2020, Congress passed the Broadband DATA Act, Pub.L.116-130, which requires the FCC to collect granular service availability data from wired, fixed wireless, and satellite broadband providers, and to create maps based on this information. The FCC has already implemented many of the Broadband DATA Acts requirements, and, on July 16, 2020, it released a report and order to implement collection and verification requirements for fixed and mobile broadband service availability and quality of service data.  Even under the FCCs implementation of the Broadband DATA Act, providers are required to submit advertised broadband speed and not the actual speed that customers receive; (8)  In 2018, a study by the Microsoft Corporation found that 162.8 million people in this country are not using the Internet at broadband speeds, which far exceeds the FCCs estimated number of people without broadband service access at 25 million, a number determined by the data reported from Form 477; (9) A 2019 Pew Research Center survey found that only 73 percent of American adults had high-speed Internet access at home and this figure was even lower in rural areas and low-income areas; (10)  Having accurate information concerning broadband service connectivity in this State is necessary to determine how to better focus resources on providing broadband access to all areas in New Jersey; (11)  Disadvantaged households in New Jersey do not have the means to pay for broadband service because of the high costs associated with maintaining the service; (12)  A significant amount of residents and small businesses located in rural areas of this State do not have access to broadband service; (13)   COVID-19 has exposed the digital divide in this State, making it difficult for rural and low-income areas to access medical care, continue education, and maintain employment; and (14)   This lack of access exacerbates social, economic, income, and health inequities in this State that can be addressed by taking measures that secure broadband access for areas in need. b.   The Legislature therefore determines that: (1)  It shall be the public policy of this State to foster the provision of wired broadband service to disadvantaged households and to residents and small businesses located within rural areas of this State as a measure to lessen the negative economic effects of COVID-19 and improve the overall economy of this State; (2)  In order to foster the provision of wired broadband service to these residents and businesses, the State of New Jersey should have a role in meeting this need, and to serve as a source of funding for fiber optic or other wireline-based broadband service provided by State, federal, or local government entities and by private entities; (3)  The establishment of a Broadband Assistance Office within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, having duties and responsibilities that include, but are not limited to, the review and approval of proposed projects providing for the deployment of fiber optic or other wireline-based broadband service to disadvantaged households and in critical areas, and the provision of financing for these projects, would meet this important need; and (4)   It shall be a goal for the States residents and businesses to have universal access to a fiber optic or other wireline-based broadband service provider, offering data transfer speeds of at least 25 megabits per second (Mbps) download and at least three Mbps upload by 2025 and at least 100 Mbps download and 100 Mbps upload by 2029.
