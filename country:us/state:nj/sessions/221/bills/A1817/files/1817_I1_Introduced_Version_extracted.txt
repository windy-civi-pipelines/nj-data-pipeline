(cf: P.L.1989, c.56, s.8) 20.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the 12th month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill, named the New Jersey Endangered and Threatened Plant Protection Act, would prohibit certain actions relative to endangered and threatened plant species, and would direct the Commissioner of Environmental Protection to establish programs for protection of endangered and threatened plant species. The bill would define endangered and threatened plant species as any species on the respective lists developed by the Division of Parks and Forestry in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) pursuant to the Endangered Plant Species List Act, P.L.1989, c.56 (C.13:1B-15.151 et seq.).  The bill would create a new category of protection under that act named threatened plant species which is defined as any native plant species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range, including, but not limited to, plant species designated as listed, proposed, or under review by the federal government as threatened throughout its range in the United States pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973. Consequently, the bill would also rename the State law to be the Endangered and Threatened Plant Species List Act. The bill would prohibit the following actions relative to endangered and threatened plant species, without a permit: transport, export, import; willfully damaging, or destroying a listed plant species on State property; removing, cutting, digging up, damaging or otherwise intentionally destroying a listed plant species if the person knows, or should have known, that the species is a listed plant species; damaging or destroying a listed plant species during the course of a criminal trespass; and selling or offering to sell a listed plant species.  The bill includes exceptions for typical and existing agricultural and aquacultural operations, and allows the commissioner to allow exceptions for research, educational, and other purposes consistent with the bill. The bill would require the commissioner to establish programs, including the acquisition of land or aquatic habitats, as are deemed necessary for the conservation and management of endangered and threatened plant species.  The bill provides that the commissioner may receive money from the federal government, private sources, and others to be deposited into the fund created by the Endangered Plant Species List Act, to be used for the purposes of the bill. The bill would also direct the commissioner to establish the Endangered and Threatened Plant Species Advisory Committee for advising and assisting the commissioner.  The committee would be comprised of three members of the States academic community, three members from environmental organizations, and three members of the public at large, who may also be affiliated with the academic community or an environmental organization.  The committee members would be appointed by the commissioner and be required to have expertise, knowledge, or experience in endangered and threatened species protection or the native plants of New Jersey. The commissioner would also be required to develop conservation plans for the conservation and survival of endangered plant species in conjunction with the Endangered and Threatened Plant Species Advisory Committee.  The bill would provide for public comment on each conservation plan, and require the commissioner to create a system for the prioritization of the creation and implementation of conservation plans. The bill provides substantially similar violation and enforcement provisions as used in the Endangered and Nongame Species Conservation Act, P.L.1973, c.309 (C.23:2A-1 et seq.). All moneys collected for a violation would be deposited into the fund created by the Endangered Plant Species List Act.  The bill would also amend the Endangered Plant Species List Act to provide that monies in the fund created pursuant to that act may also be used to implement this bill.  Additionally, the bill amends provisions of law to clarify the responsibilities of the Natural Heritage Program in developing and maintaining the list of endangered and threatened plant species, and plant species of concern.  The Natural Heritage Program established by statute in 1988, requires the DEP to identify the most critically important natural areas in the State.

(5)   an order requiring that the violator restore the site of the violation to the maximum extent practicable and feasible or, in the event that restoration of the site of the violation is not practicable or feasible, provide for off-site restoration alternatives as approved by the department. d.   The commissioner is authorized to assess a civil administrative penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation of the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and each day during which each violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  Any amount assessed under this subsection shall fall within a range established by regulation by the commissioner for violations of similar type, seriousness, duration, and conduct; provided, however, that prior to the adoption of the regulation, the commissioner may, on a case-by-case basis, assess civil administrative penalties up to a maximum of $25,000 per day for each violation.  In addition to any administrative penalty to be assessed under this subsection, and notwithstanding the $25,000 maximum penalty set forth above, the commissioner may assess any economic benefits from the violation gained by the violator.  Prior to assessment of a penalty under this subsection, the property owner or person committing the violation shall be notified by certified mail or personal service that the penalty is being assessed.  The notice shall include a reference to the section of the statute, regulation, or order or permit condition violated; recite the facts alleged to constitute a violation; state the basis for the amount of the civil penalties to be assessed; and affirm the rights of the alleged violator to a hearing.  The ordered party shall have 35 calendar days from receipt of the notice within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine specified in the notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a final order after the expiration of the 35-day period.  Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order.  The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this section in an amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate.  A civil administrative penalty assessed, including a portion thereof required to be paid pursuant to a payment schedule approved by the department, which is not paid within 90 days of the date that payment of the penalty is due, shall be subject to an interest charge on the amount of the penalty, or portion thereof, which shall accrue as of the date payment is due.  If the penalty is contested, no additional interest charge shall accrue on the amount of the penalty until after the date on which a final order is issued.  Interest charges assessed and collectible pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the rate of interest on judgments provided in the New Jersey Rules of Court. e.     A person who violates any provision of P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or any rule or regulation adopted, or permit or order issued pursuant thereto, or an order issued pursuant to subsection b. of this section, or a court order issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or who fails to pay in full a civil administrative penalty levied pursuant to subsection d. of this section, or who fails to make a payment pursuant to a penalty payment schedule entered into with the department, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement on any application, record, report, or other document required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each day during which the violation continues.  Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected with costs in a summary proceeding pursuant to the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  In addition to any penalties, costs, or interest charges, the court may assess against the violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the violation.  The Superior Court and municipal courts shall have jurisdiction to enforce the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999. f.     A person who purposely, knowingly, or recklessly violates any provision of P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or any rule or regulation adopted, or permit or order issued pursuant thereto, shall be guilty, upon conviction, of a crime of the third degree and shall, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-3, be subject to a fine of not less than $5,000 nor more than $50,000 per day of violation, or to imprisonment, or both.  A person who purposely, knowingly, or recklessly makes a false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, or other document filed or required to be maintained under any provision of P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or any rule or regulation adopted, or permit or order issued pursuant thereto; or who falsifies, tampers with, or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly renders inaccurate, any monitoring device or method required to be maintained pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or any rule or regulation adopted, or permit or order issued pursuant thereto, shall be guilty, upon conviction, of a crime of the third degree and shall, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-3, be subject to a fine of not more than $50,000 per day of violation, or to imprisonment, or both. g.    All penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the fund established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1989, c.56 (C.13:1B-15.156), and appropriated to the department for the authorized purposes of the fund. h.    An applicant or permittee, upon the request of the department, shall provide any information the department requires to determine compliance with any provision of P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or of any rule or regulation adopted, or permit or order issued pursuant thereto. 10.  Section 2 of P.L.1988, c.127 (C.13:1B-15.147) is amended to read as follows: 2.    There is established in the Division of Parks and Forestry, Department of Environmental Protection, a Natural Heritage Program.  The purpose of the program is to : a.     identify the most critically important natural areas in the State, including those areas that are of critical importance to the species listed pursuant to the Endangered and Threatened Plant Species List Act, P.L.1989, c.56 (C.13:1B-15.151 et seq.), or The Endangered and Nongame Species Conservation Act, P.L.1973, c.309 (C.23:2A-1 et seq.), or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto; and b.    provide detailed up-to-date information on [rare species] species of fauna or flora that are of special concern, rare, threatened, or endangered, and natural communities , including species location data and land-use and land-cover data regarding critical habitat, to planners, developers, and conservation agencies for use in resource management, environmental impact assessment, and both public and private land protection efforts.

(cf: P.L.1989, c.56, s.8) 20.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the 12th month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill, named the New Jersey Endangered and Threatened Plant Protection Act, would prohibit certain actions relative to endangered and threatened plant species, and would direct the Commissioner of Environmental Protection to establish programs for protection of endangered and threatened plant species. The bill would define endangered and threatened plant species as any species on the respective lists developed by the Division of Parks and Forestry in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) pursuant to the Endangered Plant Species List Act, P.L.1989, c.56 (C.13:1B-15.151 et seq.).  The bill would create a new category of protection under that act named threatened plant species which is defined as any native plant species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range, including, but not limited to, plant species designated as listed, proposed, or under review by the federal government as threatened throughout its range in the United States pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973. Consequently, the bill would also rename the State law to be the Endangered and Threatened Plant Species List Act. The bill would prohibit the following actions relative to endangered and threatened plant species, without a permit: transport, export, import; willfully damaging, or destroying a listed plant species on State property; removing, cutting, digging up, damaging or otherwise intentionally destroying a listed plant species if the person knows, or should have known, that the species is a listed plant species; damaging or destroying a listed plant species during the course of a criminal trespass; and selling or offering to sell a listed plant species.  The bill includes exceptions for typical and existing agricultural and aquacultural operations, and allows the commissioner to allow exceptions for research, educational, and other purposes consistent with the bill. The bill would require the commissioner to establish programs, including the acquisition of land or aquatic habitats, as are deemed necessary for the conservation and management of endangered and threatened plant species.  The bill provides that the commissioner may receive money from the federal government, private sources, and others to be deposited into the fund created by the Endangered Plant Species List Act, to be used for the purposes of the bill. The bill would also direct the commissioner to establish the Endangered and Threatened Plant Species Advisory Committee for advising and assisting the commissioner.  The committee would be comprised of three members of the States academic community, three members from environmental organizations, and three members of the public at large, who may also be affiliated with the academic community or an environmental organization.  The committee members would be appointed by the commissioner and be required to have expertise, knowledge, or experience in endangered and threatened species protection or the native plants of New Jersey. The commissioner would also be required to develop conservation plans for the conservation and survival of endangered plant species in conjunction with the Endangered and Threatened Plant Species Advisory Committee.  The bill would provide for public comment on each conservation plan, and require the commissioner to create a system for the prioritization of the creation and implementation of conservation plans. The bill provides substantially similar violation and enforcement provisions as used in the Endangered and Nongame Species Conservation Act, P.L.1973, c.309 (C.23:2A-1 et seq.). All moneys collected for a violation would be deposited into the fund created by the Endangered Plant Species List Act.  The bill would also amend the Endangered Plant Species List Act to provide that monies in the fund created pursuant to that act may also be used to implement this bill.  Additionally, the bill amends provisions of law to clarify the responsibilities of the Natural Heritage Program in developing and maintaining the list of endangered and threatened plant species, and plant species of concern.  The Natural Heritage Program established by statute in 1988, requires the DEP to identify the most critically important natural areas in the State.
