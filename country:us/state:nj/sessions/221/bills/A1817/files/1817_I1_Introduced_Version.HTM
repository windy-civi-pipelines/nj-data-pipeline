continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  Any
amount assessed under this subsection shall fall within a range established by
regulation by the commissioner for violations of similar type, seriousness,
duration, and conduct; provided, however, that prior to the adoption of the
regulation, the commissioner may, on a case-by-case basis, assess civil
administrative penalties up to a maximum of $25,000 per day for each
violation.  In addition to any administrative penalty to be assessed under this
subsection, and notwithstanding the $25,000 maximum penalty set forth above,
the commissioner may assess any economic benefits from the violation gained by
the violator.  Prior to assessment of a penalty under this subsection, the
property owner or person committing the violation shall be notified by
certified mail or personal service that the penalty is being assessed.  The
notice shall include a reference to the section of the statute, regulation, or
order or permit condition violated; recite the facts alleged to constitute a
violation; state the basis for the amount of the civil penalties to be
assessed; and affirm the rights of the alleged violator to a hearing.  The
ordered party shall have 35 calendar days from receipt of the notice within
which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After
the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may
issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine specified in the
notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a final order
after the expiration of the 35-day period.  Payment of the assessment is due
when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order.  The
authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other
enforcement provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature
as this bill), and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect
the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the
violation for which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise
any civil administrative penalty assessed under this section in an amount and
with conditions the department determines appropriate.  A civil administrative
penalty assessed, including a portion thereof required to be paid pursuant to a
payment schedule approved by the department, which is not paid within 90 days
of the date that payment of the penalty is due, shall be subject to an interest
charge on the amount of the penalty, or portion thereof, which shall accrue as
of the date payment is due.  If the penalty is contested, no additional
interest charge shall accrue on the amount of the penalty until after the date
on which a final order is issued.  Interest charges assessed and collectible
pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the rate of interest on judgments
provided in the New Jersey Rules of Court.</p>

court order issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or who fails to
pay in full a civil administrative penalty levied pursuant to subsection d. of
this section, or who fails to make a payment pursuant to a penalty payment

misleading statement on any application, record, report, or other document
required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a
court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each day during which the
violation continues.  Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may
be collected with costs in a summary proceeding pursuant to the Penalty
Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  In addition to
any penalties, costs, or interest charges, the court may assess against the
violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the
violation.  The Superior Court and municipal courts shall have jurisdiction to
enforce the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, named the New
Jersey Endangered and Threatened Plant Protection Act, would prohibit certain
actions relative to endangered and threatened plant species, and would direct
the Commissioner of Environmental Protection to establish programs for
protection of endangered and threatened plant species.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would define endangered
and threatened plant species as any species on the respective lists developed
by the Division of Parks and Forestry in the Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP) pursuant to the Endangered Plant Species List Act, P.L.1989,
c.56 (C.13:1B-15.151 et seq.).  The bill would create a new category of
protection under that act named threatened plant species which is defined as any
native plant species which is likely to become an endangered species within the
foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range,
including, but not limited to, plant species designated as listed, proposed, or
under review by the federal government as threatened throughout its range in
the United States pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973. 
Consequently, the bill would also rename the State law to be the Endangered
and Threatened Plant Species List Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would prohibit the
following actions relative to endangered and threatened plant species, without
a permit: transport, export, import; willfully damaging, or destroying a listed
plant species on State property; removing, cutting, digging up, damaging or
otherwise intentionally destroying a listed plant species if the person knows,
or should have known, that the species is a listed plant species; damaging or
destroying a listed plant species during the course of a criminal trespass; and
selling or offering to sell a listed plant species.  The bill includes
exceptions for typical and existing agricultural and aquacultural operations,
and allows the commissioner to allow exceptions for research, educational, and
other purposes consistent with the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the
commissioner to establish programs, including the acquisition of land or
aquatic habitats, as are deemed necessary for the conservation and management
of endangered and threatened plant species.  The bill provides that the
commissioner may receive money from the federal government, private sources,
and others to be deposited into the fund created by the Endangered Plant
Species List Act, to be used for the purposes of the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also direct the
commissioner to establish the Endangered and Threatened Plant Species Advisory
Committee for advising and assisting the commissioner.  The committee would be
comprised of three members of the States academic community, three members
from environmental organizations, and three members of the public at large, who
may also be affiliated with the academic community or an environmental
organization.  The committee members would be appointed by the commissioner and
be required to have expertise, knowledge, or experience in endangered and
threatened species protection or the native plants of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner would also be
required to develop conservation plans for the conservation and survival of
endangered plant species in conjunction with the Endangered and Threatened Plant
Species Advisory Committee.  The bill would provide for public comment on each
conservation plan, and require the commissioner to create a system for the
prioritization of the creation and implementation of conservation plans.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides
substantially similar violation and enforcement provisions as used in the Endangered
and Nongame Species Conservation Act, P.L.1973, c.309 (C.23:2A-1 et seq.). All
moneys collected for a violation would be deposited into the fund created by
the Endangered Plant Species List Act.  The bill would also amend the Endangered
Plant Species List Act to provide that monies in the fund created pursuant to
that act may also be used to implement this bill.  Additionally, the bill
amends provisions of law to clarify the responsibilities of the Natural
Heritage Program in developing and maintaining the list of endangered and
threatened plant species, and plant species of concern.  The Natural Heritage
Program established by statute in 1988, requires the DEP to identify the most
critically important natural areas in the State. </p>
