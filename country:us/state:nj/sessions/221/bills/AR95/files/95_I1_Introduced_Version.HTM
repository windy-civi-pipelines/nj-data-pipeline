CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Assembly Resolution urging Congress to amend the tax code to exclude all forms of discharged student loans from federal income tax. Whereas, Under federal law, income from discharge of indebtedness is subject to the income tax unless there is a specified exception in the law; and Whereas, Discharged student loans are not subject to the income tax if, for example, they are forgiven through a provision of the loan that allows forgiveness when the borrower works for certain employers in particular professions for a designated period of time; and Whereas, Teachers and other public service employees meeting the requirements can qualify for such forgiveness through the Teacher Loan Forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness programs; and Whereas, As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Pub.L.115-97, Congress also excluded from the income tax discharge of student loans on account of death or disability if the discharge occurs after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026; and Whereas, Student loans discharged for certain other reasons, as the forgiveness of loans in Income-Driven Repayment-Plans after the 20 or 25 year repayment period, are still subject to federal income taxation; and Whereas, Because not all forms of discharged student loans are excluded from the federal income tax, there are borrowers who have their student loans forgiven, but as a result have to pay the federal income tax on the amount forgiven; and Whereas, Discharge of student loans would be far more helpful to those in greatest need of discharge if the borrower did not have to pay the income tax on the amount discharged; and Whereas, It is fitting and proper for this House to urge Congress to reassess the circumstances under which discharged student loans are subject to the federal income tax and to permanently exclude the discharge of student debt on account of death or disability from the income tax; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House urges Congress to exclude all forms of discharged student loans from federal income taxation. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to each member of Congress representing New Jersey, the Secretary of the United States Treasury, and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. STATEMENT This resolution urges Congress to exclude all forms of discharged student loans from the federal income tax. Federal law requires payment of the income tax on forgiven debt except in certain circumstances.  For example, student loans forgiven for teachers and public service employees eligible for Teacher Loan Forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness programs are not subject to the income tax. Discharge of student debt on account of death or disability is also not subject to the income tax but only if the debt is discharged between December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2026.  Other forms of discharged student debt, such as the forgiveness of loans in Income-Driven Repayment-Plans after the 20 or 25 year repayment period, are subject to federal income taxation.  This House therefore urges Congress to make the discharge of student debt on account of death or disability exception to the income tax a permanent part of the tax code, and to permanently exclude from the income tax all other forms of discharged student loans.
