Postmenopause is the period of time after menopause after a womans menstrual periods have ceased for 12 consecutive months.  Natural postmenopause typically occurs sometime between a womans late 40s and early 60s, with the average postmenopausal age being 51 years old. Postmenopause is caused by the same hormonal changes that drive the entire menopause transition and can be influenced by internal factors such as fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone hormones and external factors such as lifestyle habits, stress, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. It is a common belief that the uncomfortable symptoms associated with menopause will disappear once postmenopause begins; however, some women can continue to experience symptoms during postmenopause, which can be very similar to the symptoms experienced during menopause and perimenopause.  Postmenopausal women may be at an increased risk for health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and urinary tract infections, which are conditions where early awareness of a womans elevated risk can help women receive appropriate and timely healthcare.  A bone density screening test is an example of an important screening tool for postmenopausal women that can help determine the levels of calcium in bones and allow postmenopausal women to take timely action to prevent osteoporosis. Since 2009, the International Menopause Society, in collaboration with the World Health Organization, has designated October as World Menopause Awareness Month, with October 18 celebrated as World Menopause Awareness Day with the purpose of raising awareness of menopause and the support options available for improving health and well-being throughout the menopause process.  It is fitting and proper for the State of New Jersey to designate October 18 of each year as Postmenopause Day in order to raise awareness about the period of time after menopause, the symptoms and health risks associated with postmenopause, and the disease management options available for women experiencing postmenopause.
