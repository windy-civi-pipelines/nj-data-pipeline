The bill: 1) delineates the responsibilities of the board, which include the approval of licensure applications; recognition of entities accrediting midwifery certification programs and national entities issuing the certifications; 2) establishes continuing education requirements; 3) requires applicants to meet certain standards to qualify for a license; and 4) authorizes the State Board of Midwifery to grant individuals currently licensed as a CM, CNM, or CPM by the State Board of Medical Examiners a license at that same level. The bill also updates current law authorizing CMs and CNMs to prescribe certain drugs by, among other items, expanding the services a CM and CNM can provide to include ordering, dispensing and administering prescription drugs and medical devices.

The bill: 1) delineates the responsibilities of the board, which include the approval of licensure applications; recognition of entities accrediting midwifery certification programs and national entities issuing the certifications; 2) establishes continuing education requirements; 3) requires applicants to meet certain standards to qualify for a license; and 4) authorizes the State Board of Midwifery to grant individuals currently licensed as a CM, CNM, or CPM by the State Board of Medical Examiners a license at that same level. The bill also updates current law authorizing CMs and CNMs to prescribe certain drugs by, among other items, expanding the services a CM and CNM can provide to include ordering, dispensing and administering prescription drugs and medical devices.
