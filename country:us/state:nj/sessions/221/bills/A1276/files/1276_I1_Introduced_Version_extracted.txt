STATEMENT This bill would prohibit any foreign government or foreign person from acquiring, purchasing, or otherwise obtaining a legal, beneficial, or other interest in any agricultural land in the State on or after the bills effective date, with limited exceptions, as described below. The bill would permit a foreign government or foreign person that already owns or holds an interest in agricultural land in the State, on the bills effective date, to continue to own or hold the interest in such land for a maximum of five years thereafter. Within five years after the bills effective date, the foreign government or foreign person would be required to sell or otherwise convey the ownership of, or interest in, the agricultural land to an individual, trust, corporation, partnership, or other business entity that is not a foreign government or foreign person, with a deed of easement attached to the land requiring the land to remain devoted to agricultural use. The bill would provide the following exceptions to the general prohibition on the continued foreign ownership of agricultural land: 1) a foreign government or foreign person may acquire agricultural land, on or after the bills effective date, through a process of law involving the collection of debt, the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the forfeiture of a contract for deed, or the imposition of a lien or claim on the land, whether by mortgage or otherwise, but such person or government would then be required to sell or convey the land, within two years after the transfer of title thereto, to an individual, trust, corporation, partnership, or other business entity that is not a foreign government or foreign person, with a deed of easement attached to the land requiring the land to remain devoted to agricultural use; and 2) the provisions of the bill would not be applicable to agricultural land acquired by devise or descent or pursuant to a bona fide encumbrance established on agricultural land taken for the purposes of security. The bill further provides that, whenever a land assessment valuation is undertaken in association with a foreign government or persons acquisition of land pursuant to a process of law involving the collection of debt, the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the forfeiture of a contract for deed, or the imposition of a lien or claim on the land, whether created by a mortgage or otherwise, the valuation is to incorporate and reflect the fact that the land is to remain devoted to agricultural use. Finally, the bill provides that any provision thereof which is inconsistent with, or in violation of, any treaty between the United States and another country would not apply to any foreign government or foreign person residing in a country that is party to the treaty. This bill establishes prohibitions on foreign ownership of agricultural land similar to those established in Iowa law and provisions in other state laws that restrict foreign ownership of agricultural land.  Nine states have laws restricting foreign ownership of agricultural land:  Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.  Iowa has imposed restrictions on the foreign ownership of land since the 19th century.  Since the 1970s when Iowas law became a near-complete ban on foreign ownership, Iowas law is regarded as one of the strictest in the nation.
