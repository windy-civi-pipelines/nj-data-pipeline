<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill updates the
definition of veteran in various statutes to include discharged LGBTQ
veterans.  This bill also requires the Department of Military and Veterans
Affairs (DMVA) to develop a review process for discharged LGBTQ veterans
concerning lost benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An estimated 100,000 LGBTQ
veterans were discharged from the military under less than honorable conditions
from the start of World War II until the 2011 repeal of the militarys 1993
Dont Ask, Dont Tell policy.  Transgender veterans continued to be banned
and discharged from service until the June 2016 Directive-Type Memorandum-16-005,
issued by then-Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, which was subsequently
reversed by the March 2019 Directive-Type Memorandum-19-004, issued by Deputy
Secretary of Defense David Norquist.  These veterans lost their right to both
state and federal benefits by being discharged under less than honorable
conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill adds a definition of
discharged LGBTQ veteran to various statutory definitions of veteran. 
Discharged LGBTQ veteran means a veteran who was discharged less than
honorably from military or naval service due to their sexual orientation or
gender identity or expression, or statements, consensual sexual conduct, or
consensual acts relating to sexual orientation or gender identity or
expression, or the disclosure of such statements, conduct, or acts that were
prohibited by the Armed Forces of the United States at the time of discharge.  The
added definition, along with the addition of a DMVA review process for discharged
LGBTQ veterans, will restore State benefits for those veterans.</p>
