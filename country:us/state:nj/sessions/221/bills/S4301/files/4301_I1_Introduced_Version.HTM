STATEMENT This bill authorizes special agents of the Department of the Treasury to act as officers for the detection, apprehension, arrest, and conviction of offenders against the law and permits them to carry a firearm at all times. The bill requires special agents to complete a basic police training course approved by the Police Training Commission in order to be accorded police powers. Under current law, a special agent of the department who has passed an examination in an approved police training program may carry a firearm while in the actual performance of official duties and while traveling to or from a place of duty. This bill allows a special agent to carry a firearm at all times, subject to regulations set forth by the Director of the Division of Taxation. This bill also empowers special agents to seize any contraband when enforcing the tax laws in addition to counterfeit stamps, counterfeit impression devices, and cigarettes which they are permitted to seize under current law.
