<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    R.S.9:2-4 is amended to
read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9:2-4.  The Legislature finds
and declares that it is in the public policy of this State to assure minor
children of frequent and continuing contact with both parents after the parents
have separated or dissolved their marriage and that it is in the public
interest to encourage parents to share the rights and responsibilities of child
rearing in order to effect this policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In any proceeding involving
the custody of a minor child, the rights of both parents shall be equal and the
court shall enter an order which may include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Joint custody of  a
minor child to both parents, which is comprised of legal custody or physical
custody which shall include: (1) provisions for residential arrangements so
that a child shall reside either solely with one parent or alternatively with
each parent in accordance with the needs of the parents and the child; and (2)
provisions for consultation between the parents in making major decisions
regarding the child's health, education and general welfare;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Sole custody to one
parent with appropriate parenting time for the noncustodial parent<u>.  In
making a custody decision, the court shall not, solely in order to improve a
deficient relationship with the other parent of a child, remove the child from
or restrict contact between the child and a parent: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(1)   who is competent and
protective of the child and is not physically or sexually abusive; or</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(2) with whom the child is
bonded or to whom the child is attached. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The court shall not order 
reunification therapy that is predicated on removing or restricting contact
with a parent with whom the child is bonded or to whom the child is attached. 
A court shall not order reunification therapy unless there is generally
accepted and scientifically valid proof of the safety, effectiveness, and
therapeutic value of the reunification therapy.  Any order to remediate the
resistance of a child to have contact with a violent or abusive parent shall
address the behavior of that parent or the contribution of that parent to the
resistance of the child prior to ordering the other parent to take steps to
potentially improve the relationship. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>For the purposes of this
section, reunification therapy means family therapy that aims to reunite or
reestablish a relationship between a parent and a child</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Any other custody
arrangement as the court may determine to be in the best interests of the
child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In making an award of custody,
the court shall consider but not be limited to the following factors: the
parents' ability to agree, communicate and cooperate in matters relating to the
child; the parents' willingness to accept custody and any history of
unwillingness to allow parenting time not based on substantiated abuse; the
interaction and relationship of the child with <b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>its<b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>the childs</u> parents and
siblings; the history of domestic violence, if any; the safety of the child and
the safety of either parent from physical abuse by the other parent; <u>the
existence of any restraining orders or protective orders;</u> the preference of
the child when of sufficient age and capacity to reason so as to form an
intelligent decision; the needs of the child; the stability of the home environment
offered; the quality and continuity of the child's education; the fitness of
the parents; the geographical proximity of the parents' homes; the extent and
quality of the time spent with the child prior to or subsequent to the
separation; the parents' employment responsibilities; and the age and number of
the children.  A parent shall not be deemed unfit unless the parents' conduct
has a substantial adverse effect on the child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The court, for good cause and
upon its own motion, may appoint a guardian ad litem or an attorney or both to
represent the minor child's interests.  The court shall have the authority to
award a counsel fee to the guardian ad litem and the attorney and to assess
that cost between the parties to the litigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The court shall order
any custody arrangement which is agreed to by both parents unless it is
contrary to the best interests of the child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In any case in which
the parents cannot agree to a custody arrangement, the court may require each
parent to submit a custody plan which the court shall consider in awarding
custody.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The court shall
specifically place on the record the factors which justify any custody
arrangement not agreed to by both parents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)   In any
proceeding with respect to child custody in which a parent has been alleged to
have committed domestic violence or child abuse, including child sexual abuse: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Expert evidence from a
court-appointed or outside professional relating to the alleged abuse may be admitted
only if the professional possesses demonstrated expertise and clinical
experience in working with victims of domestic violence or child abuse,
including child sexual abuse, that is not solely of a forensic nature; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In making a finding
regarding any allegation of domestic violence or child abuse, including child
sexual abuse, in addition to any other relevant admissible evidence, evidence

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a
training and educational program for certain court personnel, includes child
safety as a factor in court decision-making when a party raises abuse
allegations or safety concerns, and implements expert evidence standards in
child abuse and domestic violence proceedings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
Administrative Director of the Courts to create a training and educational
program related to child abuse that includes information concerning all aspects
of abuse, including sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, implicit and
explicit bias, trauma, neglect, maltreatment, and the impact of child abuse and
domestic violence on children.  The program is required to implement best
practices from evidence-based and peer-reviewed research.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a judge is
prohibited from ordering a child to be removed from or restricted from
contacting a parent who is competent, protective of the child, and not
physically or sexually abusive, or a parent with whom the child is bonded or to
whom the child is attached, solely for the purpose of improving a deficient
relationship with the other parent.  The court also is prohibited from ordering
reunification therapy that is predicated on removing or restricting a child
from a parent with whom the child is bonded or attached.  Further, in making an
award for custody, a court is required to consider the existence of any prior
restraining order or protective order against a parent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, this bill implements
minimum requirements for expert evidence and evidence that may be admissible in
child custody proceedings where a parent has been alleged to have committed
domestic violence or child abuse.  Expert evidence may be admitted only if the
professional possesses demonstrated expertise and clinical experience working
with domestic violence or child abuse victims.  Further, in making a finding
regarding any allegation of domestic violence or child abuse, evidence of past
sexual or physical abuse committed by the accused parent may be considered
including, but not limited to, any: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   past or current
restraining orders or protection orders against the accused parent, including
sexual violence abuse protection orders; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   arrests or convictions
of the accused parent for domestic violence, sexual violence, or child abuse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill implements the
Kaydens Law provisions of the federal Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization
Act of 2022, enacted in March 2022. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Kaydens Law provisions
were named for seven-year-old Kayden Mancuso of Lower Makefield, PA. In 2018,
Kayden was murdered by her father during an unsupervised visitation period
ordered by the court. Kaydens mother had objected to unsupervised visitation
on the grounds that Kaydens father had a history of violence and was mentally
unstable. </p>
