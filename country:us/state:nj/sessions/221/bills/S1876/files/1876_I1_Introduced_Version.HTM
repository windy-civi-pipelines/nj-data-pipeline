A voter's telephone number and email address shall not be subject to public disclosure and shall not be considered a public record. e.     Each county clerk shall ensure that any political affiliation or designation on the inner envelope provided to each voter shall not be visible to the public on the outer envelopes exterior. (cf: P.L.2020, c.70, s.9) 6.    This act shall take effect on January 1st next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill prohibits any mail-in ballot outer envelope from containing a political affiliation or designation visible to the public. Under current law, the county clerk in each county mails a mail-in ballot to each voter who votes by mail. The mail-in ballot envelope contains the blank ballot, an outer envelope, and an inner envelope. When the voter completes the ballot, the voter places the voted ballot inside the inner envelope, and places the inner envelope inside the outer envelope, which is addressed to the appropriate county board of elections for mailing. This bill requires each county clerk to ensure that the outer envelope and the envelope that is used to mail the blank ballot, outer envelope, and inner envelope to each voter do not contain any political affiliation or designation visible to the public on the envelopes exterior.  This bill also requires each county clerk to ensure that any political affiliation or designation on the inner envelope is not visible to the public on the outer envelopes exterior.

STATEMENT This bill prohibits any mail-in ballot outer envelope from containing a political affiliation or designation visible to the public. Under current law, the county clerk in each county mails a mail-in ballot to each voter who votes by mail. The mail-in ballot envelope contains the blank ballot, an outer envelope, and an inner envelope. When the voter completes the ballot, the voter places the voted ballot inside the inner envelope, and places the inner envelope inside the outer envelope, which is addressed to the appropriate county board of elections for mailing. This bill requires each county clerk to ensure that the outer envelope and the envelope that is used to mail the blank ballot, outer envelope, and inner envelope to each voter do not contain any political affiliation or designation visible to the public on the envelopes exterior.  This bill also requires each county clerk to ensure that any political affiliation or designation on the inner envelope is not visible to the public on the outer envelopes exterior.
