Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;line-height:150%'>     1.    (New
section)  Application for Temporary Protective Order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Any witness or victim
of any crime enumerated in subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117
(C.2C:43-7.2), who an actor has attempted to prevent or obstruct by means of
force or intimidation from reporting the crime to a law enforcement agency with
the purpose to hinder the actors own or anothers detention, apprehension,
investigation, prosecution, conviction, or punishment  in violation of
N.J.S.2C:29-3, and who is not eligible for a restraining order as a victim of
domestic violence as defined by the provisions of subsection d. of section 3
of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19), may file an application with the Superior
Court pursuant to the Rules of Court alleging such conduct or attempted conduct
and seeking a temporary protective order.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    An application filed or
a protective order issued pursuant to the provisions of P.L.       , c.    (C.  
    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not prevent the
filing of a motion or issuance of a protective order under the provisions of
P.L.1985, c.250 (C.2C:28-5.1 et seq.).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     An applicant may seek a
protective order and the court may issue such an order regardless of whether
criminal charges based on the incident were filed and regardless of the
disposition of any charges. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The filing of an
application pursuant to this section shall not prevent the filing of a criminal
complaint, or the institution or maintenance of a criminal prosecution based on
the same act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The court shall waive
any requirement that the applicants or alleged victims place of residence
appear on the application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     An applicant may seek a
protection order in a court having jurisdiction over the place where the
alleged conduct or attempted conduct occurred, where the respondent resides, or
where the alleged victim resides or is sheltered.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  Temporary
Protective Order. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The alleged victim may
seek emergency, ex parte relief in the nature of a temporary protective order. 
A judge of the Superior Court may enter an emergency, ex parte order when
necessary to protect the safety and well-being of an alleged victim on whose
behalf the relief is being sought.  The court may grant any relief necessary to
protect the safety and well-being of an alleged victim.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    On weekends, holidays
and other times when the court is closed, an alleged victim may file an
application before a judge of the Superior Court or a municipal court judge who
shall be assigned to accept applications and issue emergency, ex parte relief
in the form of temporary protective orders pursuant to this act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The court may, pursuant
to court rules, issue a temporary protective order upon sworn testimony or an
application of an alleged victim who is not physically present or by a person
who represents an alleged victim who is physically or mentally incapable of
filing personally.  A temporary protective order may be issued if the judge is
satisfied that exigent circumstances exist sufficient to excuse the failure of
the applicant to appear personally and that sufficient grounds for granting the
application have been shown. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    An order for emergency,
ex parte relief shall be granted upon good cause shown and shall remain in
effect until a judge of the Superior Court issues a further order.  Any
temporary protective order issued pursuant to this section is immediately
appealable for a plenary hearing de novo not on the record before any judge of
the Superior Court of the county in which the alleged victim resides or is
sheltered if that judge issued the temporary protective order or has access to
the reasons for the issuance of the temporary protective order and sets forth
in the record the reasons for the modification or dismissal.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The denial of a
temporary restraining order by a municipal court judge and subsequent administrative
dismissal of the complaint shall not bar the victim from refiling a complaint
in Superior Court based on the same incident and receiving an emergency ex
parte hearing de novo not on the record before a Superior Court judge, and
every denial of relief by a municipal court judge shall so state.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A temporary protective
order issued pursuant to this section may include, but is not limited to, the
following emergency relief: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   That the respondent
maintain a prescribed geographic distance from any alleged victim; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   That the respondent have
no communication with any alleged victim; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Any other relief that
the court deems appropriate.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    A copy of the temporary
protective order issued pursuant to this section shall be immediately forwarded
to the police of the municipality in which the alleged victim resides or is
sheltered.  A copy of the temporary protective order shall also be forwarded to
the sheriff of the county in which the respondent resides for immediate service
upon the respondent in accordance with the Rules of Court.  The court or the
sheriff may coordinate service of the temporary protective order upon the
respondent through the police in appropriate circumstances.  If personal
service cannot be effected upon the respondent, the court may order other
appropriate substituted service.  At no time shall the alleged victim be asked
or required to serve any order on the respondent.  </p>

pursuant to this section shall not be used in the criminal proceeding against
the respondent, other than contempt matters, and where it would otherwise be
admissible hearsay under the Rules of Evidence that govern when a party is

the application for a protective order shall be by a preponderance of the
evidence.  The court shall consider but not be limited to the following
factors: </p>

more acts of attempting to prevent or obstruct by means of force or

issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect until further order of a
judge of the Superior Court.  Either party may file a petition with the court
to dissolve or modify a final protective order.  When considering a petition
for dissolution or modification of a final protective order, the court shall
conduct a hearing to consider whether a material change in circumstances has
occurred since the issuance of the protective order which would make its
continued enforcement inequitable, oppressive or unjust taking into account the
current status of the parties, including the desire of the victim for the
continuation of the protective order, the potential for contact between the
parties, the history of the respondents violations of the protective order or
criminal convictions, and any other factors that the court may find relevant to
protecting the safety and well-being of the victim.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would authorize
protective orders for witnesses and victims of various first and second degree
crimes if an actor attempted to prevent or obstruct them from reporting, through
the means of force or intimidation, the crime to a law enforcement agency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under P.L.1985, c.250 (C.2C:28-5.1
et seq.), a court may issue a protective order for a witness or victim if the
defendant in the criminal action or any other person connected with the action
has violated or is likely to violate N.J.S.2C:28-5, N.J.S.2C:29-3 or N.J.S.2C:29-4,
or if that person has threatened to injure or intimidate any witness in the
pending offense or a member of the witness' family with purpose to affect the
testimony of the witness.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would establish a
similar form of protective order to protect any witness or victim of a first or
second degree crime enumerated in subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117
(C.2C:43-7.2), including but limited to murder, kidnapping, and sexual assault,
if an actor has attempted to prevent or obstruct through means of force or
intimidation the alleged victim from reporting the crime to a law enforcement
agency, and if the alleged victim is not eligible for a restraining order as a
victim of domestic violence under the domestic violence statutes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A protective order may be
sought, and may be issued by the court, regardless of whether criminal charges
based on the incident were filed and regardless of the disposition of any such
charges.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The court would waive any
requirement that the applicants or alleged victims place of residence appear
on the application.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An applicant may seek a
protective order in a court having jurisdiction where the alleged conduct or
attempted conduct occurred, where the respondent resides, or where the alleged
victim resides or is sheltered.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a judge of the
Superior Court may enter an emergency, ex parte order when necessary to protect
the safety and well-being of an alleged victim on whose behalf the relief is
sought.  The court would grant any relief necessary to protect the safety and
well-being of the alleged victim.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the court is closed, such
as on weekends, holidays and other times, an alleged victim may file an
application before a judge of the Superior Court or a municipal court judge who
shall be assigned to accept applications and issue emergency, ex parte relief
in the form of temporary protective orders.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the court is satisfied that
exigent circumstances exist the would excuse the alleged victim from having to
appear personally, and sufficient grounds for granting the application have
been shown, the temporary protective order would be issued, pursuant to court
rules, upon sworn testimony or an application of an alleged victim who is not
physically present, or by a person who represents an alleged victim who is
physically or mentally incapable of filing personally.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An order for emergency, ex
parte relief pursuant to the bill would be granted upon good cause shown and
would remain in effect until a judge of the Superior Court issues a further
order.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Temporary protective orders
would be forwarded to the sheriff of the county in which the respondent resides
for immediate service upon the respondent in accordance with the Rules of
Court.  The court or the sheriff may coordinate service of the final protective
order upon the respondent through the police in appropriate circumstances.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A temporary protective order
issued would be immediately appealable for a plenary hearing de novo not on the
record before any judge of the Superior Court of the county in which the
alleged victim resides or is sheltered if that judge issued the temporary
protective order or has access to the reasons for the issuance of the order and
sets forth in the record the reasons for the modification or dissolution.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A temporary protective order
issued by the court may include but not be limited to: the respondent
maintaining a certain geographic distance from the alleged victim, no
communication between the respondent and the alleged victim, and any other
relief that the court deems appropriate.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require that a
hearing be held on a final protective order in the Superior Court within 10
days of the filing of an application where the temporary protective order was
granted.  The bill provides that if a criminal complaint arising out of the
same incident which is the subject matter of the application for a protective
order has been filed, testimony given by the applicant in accordance with an
application filed pursuant to this bill would not be used in the criminal
proceeding against the respondent, other than contempt matters, and where it
would otherwise be admissible hearsay under the Rules of Evidence that govern
when a party is unavailable.  At the hearing, the standard for providing the
allegations made in the application for a final protective order would be a
preponderance of the evidence.  The court would consider but not be limited to
the following factors: the occurrence of one or more acts of attempting to
prevent or obstruct by means of force or intimidation from reporting the crime
to a law enforcement agency with the purpose to hinder the actors own or
anothers detention, apprehension, investigation, prosecution, conviction, or
punishment in violation of N.J.S.2C:29-3; and the possibility of future risk to
the safety or well-being of the alleged victim.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A final protective order would
be issued only after a finding or an admission is made that the respondent
committed an act of attempting to prevent or obstruct by means of force or
intimidation against the alleged victim.  A final protective order may include
but not be limited to: the respondent maintaining a certain geographic distance
from the alleged victim, no communication between the respondent and the
alleged victim, and any other relief that the court deems appropriate.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notice of a final protective
order issued would be sent by the clerk of the Superior Court or other person
designated by the court to the appropriate county prosecutor, the appropriate
chiefs of police, members of the State Police and any other appropriate law
enforcement agency.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A final protective order
issued would remain in effect until further order of a judge of the Superior
Court.  Either party may file a petition with the court to dissolve or modify a
final protective order.  When considering a petition for dissolution or
modification of a final protective order, the court would conduct a hearing to
consider whether a material change in circumstances has occurred since the
issuance of the protective order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any temporary or final
protective order issued pursuant to this act would be in effect throughout the
State and enforced by all law enforcement officers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A violation by the respondent
of any protective order would constitute an offense under subsection a. of
N.J.S.2C:29-9. Violations of these orders may be enforced in a civil or
criminal action initiated by the alleged victim or by the court, on its own
motion, pursuant to applicable court rules.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Attorney General would
issue directives or guidelines for police officers to promote compliance with
this act. The Administrative Office of the Courts would establish procedures to
ensure implementation of this act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors view that
many witnesses or victims of violent crimes are scared to report crimes to the police
because a person has attempted to prevent or obstruct them through means of
force or intimidation.  This bill would permit the alleged victim to obtain a
protective order from the court when they report the crime to the police.</p>
