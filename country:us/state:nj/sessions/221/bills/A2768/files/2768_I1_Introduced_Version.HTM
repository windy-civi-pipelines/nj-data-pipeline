<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the &quot;Municipal
Land Use Law&quot; (MLUL), P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1), to clarify the
approval process for site plans and subdivisions, specifically to distinguish
between the requirements applicable to preliminary and final approvals,
consistent with the Legislatures original intent.  The two-step
preliminary/final approval process under the MLUL was instituted to provide
developers of significant projects the ability to receive preliminary approval
of proposed development projects based upon a boards review of plans in
tentative form.  The two-step process enables a developer to secure approval of
the general terms and conditions of a proposed project before incurring the
costs of providing detailed plans and specifications.  A grant of preliminary
approval provides a developer with a period of protection from changes to the
general terms and conditions on which the preliminary approval was granted.  This
period of protection affords a developer security and time to assemble and
submit expensive detailed plans and specifications that are required for final
approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Unfortunately, in many
municipalities the application process for preliminary site plan and
subdivision approval has evolved to the point where detailed plans,
specifications, and engineering data are often required at the preliminary
stage.  When developers are forced to incur the significant costs of preparing
and submitting detailed engineering plans at this early, preliminary, stage of
the approval process, they become reluctant to change their proposals, in
response to comments and requests from planning board members and members of
the public, due to the costs associated with redesigning their plans.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     By reevaluating the two-step
process, and clearly distinguishing the critical components needed for
preliminary approval from the more involved and detailed information required
for final approval, this bill intends to enable applicants to secure
preliminary approval of the overall layout of a proposed site plan or
subdivision before incurring the expense of preparing detailed engineering
plans, specifications, and analyses.  This change is meant to reduce the
possibility of animosity between applicants, boards, and the general public, by
positioning applicants to be more receptive to revise their plans in response
to public opinion and comments from planning board members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
provides that a planning boards review of an application for development for
preliminary approval of a site plan would be limited to the following criteria:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>the  layout and arrangement of proposed buildings, streets,
parking, and other proposed site improvements; and </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>compliance with the use, density, floor area ratio, height, and
other zoning standards applicable to the zoning district.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Similarly, under the bill, a
planning boards review of an application for development for preliminary
approval of a subdivision would be limited to the following criteria:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>the layout and arrangement of proposed lots, as well as any
proposed streets, parking, known easements, and other proposed site
improvements; and </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>compliance with the use, density, and other zoning standards
applicable to the zoning district.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires developers
to include requests for any C variances from zoning ordinance provisions
governing these criteria in their applications for preliminary approval.  The
bill allows developers to include requests for other C variances in their
applications for preliminary approval, or to defer those variance requests
until final approval.  The bill defers review relative to assessment of
contributions for off-tract improvements until final approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill details the documents
and information that an applicant for preliminary approval of a site plan or
subdivision may be required to submit for the application to be considered
complete for the planning board's consideration.  The bill authorizes planning
boards to request additional reasonably necessary information, if an
application for preliminary approval includes a request for a C variance.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill shortens the period
of time within which a board must grant or deny an application for preliminary
approval of more extensive projects (site plans involving more than 10 acres or
more than 10 dwelling units, and subdivisions of more than 10 lots) from 95 to
75 days after the date on which a complete application for development is
submitted.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies four
circumstances that require a developer to submit an application to amend a
preliminary approval.  A developer must submit an application for development
for amended preliminary approval of a site plan if, after the grant of
preliminary site plan approval, the developer seeks to:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
developer may, at its option, submit an application for preliminary approval,
or an application to amend a preliminary approval, simultaneous with an
application for final approval.  In this case, the bill requires a planning
board to simultaneously review and act upon the applications for preliminary
approval, amended preliminary approval, and final approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a developer
seeking to construct site infrastructure improvements prior to a grant of final
approval must specifically request authorization to do so in its application
for preliminary approval.  Under this circumstance, the bill requires the
applicant to submit the required plans and specification for the proposed site infrastructure
improvements as well as other information as is reasonably required by the
planning board to determine whether the proposed site infrastructure improvements
are adequate.  A preliminary approval authorizing a developer to construct site
infrastructure improvements prior to final approval must specifically so
provide in the resolution of approval.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To allow sufficient time for
completion of the detailed engineering plans and outside agency approvals
associated with final approval of subdivisions and site plans, the bill extends
the vesting period for preliminary approvals from three years to five years. 
However, with regard to a preliminary approval that authorizes construction of
site improvements prior to final approval, the bill retains the three-year vesting
period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would amend the
statute governing the standards for final approval of site plans and major
subdivisions by requiring a planning board to grant final approval if the
detailed drawings, specifications and estimates of the application for final
approval:</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>in the case of a major subdivision, conform to the statutory requirements
for approval or filing of a map.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     However, the bill provides
that, in granting final approval of a site plan or major subdivision, a
planning board must:</p>

</span></span>consider and may grant requests for C variances that may, under
the bill, be deferred until final approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would expand the time
within which a board must grant or deny final approval from 45 days to 95 days
after submission of a complete application for final approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies that its
provisions do not supersede or relieve an applicant from satisfying a countys
land development procedures and standards, nor supersede, or relieve a
municipal approving authority from complying with, provisions of the County
Planning Act, N.J.S.A. 40:27-1 et seq. </p>
