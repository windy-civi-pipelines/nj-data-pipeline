(cf: P.L.2011, c.86, s.2) 5.    Section 38 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-50) is amended to read as follows: 38.  Final approval of site plans and major subdivisions. a.     The planning board shall grant final approval if the detailed drawings, specifications and estimates of the application for final approval conform to the standards established by ordinance for final approval, conform in all material respects with the conditions of preliminary approval and, in the case of a major subdivision, conform to the standards prescribed by N.J.S.46:26B-1 et seq.; provided that the planning board: (1)   shall permit changes to the preliminary site plan or subdivision plat, as the case may be, that do not require the developer to submit an application for development for amended preliminary approval pursuant to subsection d. of section 34 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-46) or subsection d. of section 36 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-48); (2)   shall consider and may grant requests for variances authorized pursuant to subsubparagraph (ii) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 34 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-46), and subsubparagraph (ii) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 36 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-48); and (3)   in the case of a planned development, [the planning board] may permit minimal deviations from the conditions of preliminary approval necessitated by change of conditions beyond the control of the developer since the date of preliminary approval without the developer being required to submit another application for development for preliminary approval. b.    Final approval shall be granted or denied within [45] 95 days after submission of a complete application to the administrative officer, or within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.  Failure of the planning board to act within the period prescribed shall constitute final approval and a certificate of the administrative officer as to the failure of the planning board to act shall be issued on request of the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence of approval, herein required, and shall be so accepted by the county recording officer for purposes of filing subdivision plats. Whenever review or approval of the application by the county planning board is required by section 5 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.3), in the case of a subdivision, or section 8 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.6), in the case of a site plan, the municipal planning board shall condition any approval that it grants upon timely receipt of a favorable report on the application by the county planning board or approval by the county planning board by its failure to report thereon within the required time period.  Nothing in P.L.     , c. (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall supersede, or relieve an applicant from satisfying, land development procedures and standards adopted by the governing body of a county pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.2) or section 8 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.6), nor supersede, or relieve a municipal approving authority from complying with, section 5 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.3) and section 9 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.7). (cf: P.L.2013, c.106, s.12) 6.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill amends the "Municipal Land Use Law" (MLUL), P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1), to clarify the approval process for site plans and subdivisions, specifically to distinguish between the requirements applicable to preliminary and final approvals, consistent with the Legislatures original intent.  The two-step preliminary/final approval process under the MLUL was instituted to provide developers of significant projects the ability to receive preliminary approval of proposed development projects based upon a boards review of plans in tentative form.  The two-step process enables a developer to secure approval of the general terms and conditions of a proposed project before incurring the costs of providing detailed plans and specifications.  A grant of preliminary approval provides a developer with a period of protection from changes to the general terms and conditions on which the preliminary approval was granted.  This period of protection affords a developer security and time to assemble and submit expensive detailed plans and specifications that are required for final approval. Unfortunately, in many municipalities the application process for preliminary site plan and subdivision approval has evolved to the point where detailed plans, specifications, and engineering data are often required at the preliminary stage.  When developers are forced to incur the significant costs of preparing and submitting detailed engineering plans at this early, preliminary, stage of the approval process, they become reluctant to change their proposals, in response to comments and requests from planning board members and members of the public, due to the costs associated with redesigning their plans. By reevaluating the two-step process, and clearly distinguishing the critical components needed for preliminary approval from the more involved and detailed information required for final approval, this bill intends to enable applicants to secure preliminary approval of the overall layout of a proposed site plan or subdivision before incurring the expense of preparing detailed engineering plans, specifications, and analyses.  This change is meant to reduce the possibility of animosity between applicants, boards, and the general public, by positioning applicants to be more receptive to revise their plans in response to public opinion and comments from planning board members. Specifically, the bill provides that a planning boards review of an application for development for preliminary approval of a site plan would be limited to the following criteria: · the  layout and arrangement of proposed buildings, streets, parking, and other proposed site improvements; and · compliance with the use, density, floor area ratio, height, and other zoning standards applicable to the zoning district. Similarly, under the bill, a planning boards review of an application for development for preliminary approval of a subdivision would be limited to the following criteria: · the layout and arrangement of proposed lots, as well as any proposed streets, parking, known easements, and other proposed site improvements; and · compliance with the use, density, and other zoning standards applicable to the zoning district. The bill requires developers to include requests for any C variances from zoning ordinance provisions governing these criteria in their applications for preliminary approval.  The bill allows developers to include requests for other C variances in their applications for preliminary approval, or to defer those variance requests until final approval.  The bill defers review relative to assessment of contributions for off-tract improvements until final approval. The bill details the documents and information that an applicant for preliminary approval of a site plan or subdivision may be required to submit for the application to be considered complete for the planning board's consideration.  The bill authorizes planning boards to request additional reasonably necessary information, if an application for preliminary approval includes a request for a C variance. The bill shortens the period of time within which a board must grant or deny an application for preliminary approval of more extensive projects (site plans involving more than 10 acres or more than 10 dwelling units, and subdivisions of more than 10 lots) from 95 to 75 days after the date on which a complete application for development is submitted. The bill specifies four circumstances that require a developer to submit an application to amend a preliminary approval.  A developer must submit an application for development for amended preliminary approval of a site plan if, after the grant of preliminary site plan approval, the developer seeks to: · make any substantial revisions to the layout of improvements; · increase the density for residential development by more than 10 percent or the floor area ratio for nonresidential development by more than 10 percent; · make any change to the site plan that requires a variance from a zoning ordinance governing criteria subject to review in connection with an application for development for preliminary approval; or · make any change to the site plan that affects the basis upon which any variance had been granted. A developer must submit an application for development for amended preliminary approval of a subdivision if, after the grant of preliminary subdivision approval, the developer seeks to: · make any substantial revisions to the layout of improvements; · increase the density for residential development by more than 10 percent; · make any change to the subdivision plat that requires a variance from a zoning ordinance governing criteria subject to review in connection with an application for development for preliminary approval of a subdivision; or · make any change to the subdivision that affects the basis upon which any variance had been granted. The bill provides that a developer may, at its option, submit an application for preliminary approval, or an application to amend a preliminary approval, simultaneous with an application for final approval.  In this case, the bill requires a planning board to simultaneously review and act upon the applications for preliminary approval, amended preliminary approval, and final approval. Under the bill, a developer seeking to construct site infrastructure improvements prior to a grant of final approval must specifically request authorization to do so in its application for preliminary approval.  Under this circumstance, the bill requires the applicant to submit the required plans and specification for the proposed site infrastructure improvements as well as other information as is reasonably required by the planning board to determine whether the proposed site infrastructure improvements are adequate.  A preliminary approval authorizing a developer to construct site infrastructure improvements prior to final approval must specifically so provide in the resolution of approval. To allow sufficient time for completion of the detailed engineering plans and outside agency approvals associated with final approval of subdivisions and site plans, the bill extends the vesting period for preliminary approvals from three years to five years. However, with regard to a preliminary approval that authorizes construction of site improvements prior to final approval, the bill retains the three-year vesting period. The bill would amend the statute governing the standards for final approval of site plans and major subdivisions by requiring a planning board to grant final approval if the detailed drawings, specifications and estimates of the application for final approval: · conform to the standards established by ordinance for final approval; · conform in all material respects with the conditions of preliminary approval; and · in the case of a major subdivision, conform to the statutory requirements for approval or filing of a map. However, the bill provides that, in granting final approval of a site plan or major subdivision, a planning board must: · permit changes to a preliminary approval that do not require the developer to submit an application to amend the preliminary approval; and · consider and may grant requests for C variances that may, under the bill, be deferred until final approval. The bill would expand the time within which a board must grant or deny final approval from 45 days to 95 days after submission of a complete application for final approval. The bill specifies that its provisions do not supersede or relieve an applicant from satisfying a countys land development procedures and standards, nor supersede, or relieve a municipal approving authority from complying with, provisions of the County Planning Act, N.J.S.A. 40:27-1 et seq.

(b)   The planning board may require a developer seeking to construct site infrastructure improvements prior to the grant of final subdivision approval to submit information as is reasonably necessary for the board to review the plans and specifications with a sufficient level of scrutiny to determine whether the proposed site infrastructure improvements have been adequately designed to accommodate and support the proposed development. (c)   Preliminary approval of a subdivision authorizing a developer to construct site infrastructure improvements prior to the grant of final subdivision approval shall specifically so provide in the resolution of approval. (4)   As used in this section, site infrastructure improvements shall include, but not be limited to: roadways, grading, sidewalks, street lighting, storm drainage, underground utility systems for  sewage, water, and natural gas and clearing, and grubbing. c.     [Upon the submission to the administrative officer of a complete application for a] (1)  A planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval of a subdivision of 10 or fewer lots [, the planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval] within 45 days of the date [of such submission] a complete application for development for preliminary approval of the subdivision is submitted to the administrative officer or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer.  [Upon the submission of a complete application for a] (2)   A planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval of a subdivision of more than 10 lots [, the planning board shall grant or deny preliminary approval] within [95] 75  days of the date [of such submission] a complete application for development for preliminary approval of the subdivision is submitted to the administrative officer or within such further  time as may be consented to by the developer. [Otherwise] (3)   If a planning board does not grant or deny preliminary approval of a subdivision within the timeframe specified in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, the planning board shall be deemed  to have granted preliminary approval to the subdivision. d.    A developer shall submit an application for development for amended preliminary approval of a subdivision if, after the grant of preliminary subdivision approval, the developer: (1)   seeks to make any substantial revisions to the layout of improvements; (2)   seeks to increase the density for residential development by more than 10 percent; (3)   seeks to make any change to the subdivision plat that requires a variance from a zoning ordinance governing criteria subject to review in connection with an application for development for preliminary approval of a subdivision pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section; or (4)   seeks to make any change to the subdivision that affects the basis upon which any variance had been granted. e.     A developer may, at its option, submit an application for development for preliminary approval of a subdivision, or an application for development for amended preliminary approval of a subdivision, simultaneous with an application for development for final approval of a subdivision, in which case the planning board shall simultaneously review and act upon the applications for preliminary approval and final approval. (cf: P.L.1984, c.20, s.9) 4.    Section 37 of P.L.1975, c. 291 (C.40:55D-49) is amended to read as follows: 37.  Preliminary approval of a major subdivision pursuant to section 36 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-48) or of a site plan pursuant to section 34 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-46) shall, except as provided in subsections d. and g. of this section, confer upon the applicant the following rights for a [three-year] five-year period from the date on which the resolution of preliminary approval is adopted; however, a preliminary approval authorizing a developer to construct site infrastructure improvements prior to the grant of final site plan approval pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 34 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-46) or paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 48 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-48) shall confer upon the applicant the following rights for a three-year period from the date on which the resolution of preliminary approval is adopted: a.     That the general terms and conditions on which preliminary approval was granted shall not be changed, including but not limited to use requirements; layout and design standards for streets, curbs and sidewalks; lot size; yard dimensions and off-tract improvements; and, in the case of a site plan, any requirements peculiar to site plan approval pursuant to section 29.3 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-41); except that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the municipality from modifying by ordinance such general terms and conditions of preliminary approval as relate to public health and safety; b.    That the applicant may submit for final approval on or before the expiration date of preliminary approval the whole or a section or sections of the preliminary subdivision plat or site plan, as the case may be; and c.     That the applicant may apply for and the planning board may grant extensions on such preliminary approval for additional periods of at least one year but not to exceed a total extension of two years, provided that if the design standards have been revised by ordinance, such revised standards may govern. d.    In the case of a subdivision of or site plan for an area of 50 acres or more, the planning board may grant the rights referred to in subsections a., b., and c. of this section for such period of time, longer than three years, or five years, as applicable, as shall be determined by the planning board to be reasonable taking into consideration (1) the number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area permissible under preliminary approval, (2) economic conditions, and (3) the comprehensiveness of the development.

(cf: P.L.2011, c.86, s.2) 5.    Section 38 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-50) is amended to read as follows: 38.  Final approval of site plans and major subdivisions. a.     The planning board shall grant final approval if the detailed drawings, specifications and estimates of the application for final approval conform to the standards established by ordinance for final approval, conform in all material respects with the conditions of preliminary approval and, in the case of a major subdivision, conform to the standards prescribed by N.J.S.46:26B-1 et seq.; provided that the planning board: (1)   shall permit changes to the preliminary site plan or subdivision plat, as the case may be, that do not require the developer to submit an application for development for amended preliminary approval pursuant to subsection d. of section 34 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-46) or subsection d. of section 36 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-48); (2)   shall consider and may grant requests for variances authorized pursuant to subsubparagraph (ii) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 34 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-46), and subsubparagraph (ii) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 36 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-48); and (3)   in the case of a planned development, [the planning board] may permit minimal deviations from the conditions of preliminary approval necessitated by change of conditions beyond the control of the developer since the date of preliminary approval without the developer being required to submit another application for development for preliminary approval. b.    Final approval shall be granted or denied within [45] 95 days after submission of a complete application to the administrative officer, or within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.  Failure of the planning board to act within the period prescribed shall constitute final approval and a certificate of the administrative officer as to the failure of the planning board to act shall be issued on request of the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence of approval, herein required, and shall be so accepted by the county recording officer for purposes of filing subdivision plats. Whenever review or approval of the application by the county planning board is required by section 5 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.3), in the case of a subdivision, or section 8 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.6), in the case of a site plan, the municipal planning board shall condition any approval that it grants upon timely receipt of a favorable report on the application by the county planning board or approval by the county planning board by its failure to report thereon within the required time period.  Nothing in P.L.     , c. (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall supersede, or relieve an applicant from satisfying, land development procedures and standards adopted by the governing body of a county pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.2) or section 8 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.6), nor supersede, or relieve a municipal approving authority from complying with, section 5 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.3) and section 9 of P.L.1968, c.285 (C.40:27-6.7). (cf: P.L.2013, c.106, s.12) 6.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill amends the "Municipal Land Use Law" (MLUL), P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1), to clarify the approval process for site plans and subdivisions, specifically to distinguish between the requirements applicable to preliminary and final approvals, consistent with the Legislatures original intent.  The two-step preliminary/final approval process under the MLUL was instituted to provide developers of significant projects the ability to receive preliminary approval of proposed development projects based upon a boards review of plans in tentative form.  The two-step process enables a developer to secure approval of the general terms and conditions of a proposed project before incurring the costs of providing detailed plans and specifications.  A grant of preliminary approval provides a developer with a period of protection from changes to the general terms and conditions on which the preliminary approval was granted.  This period of protection affords a developer security and time to assemble and submit expensive detailed plans and specifications that are required for final approval. Unfortunately, in many municipalities the application process for preliminary site plan and subdivision approval has evolved to the point where detailed plans, specifications, and engineering data are often required at the preliminary stage.  When developers are forced to incur the significant costs of preparing and submitting detailed engineering plans at this early, preliminary, stage of the approval process, they become reluctant to change their proposals, in response to comments and requests from planning board members and members of the public, due to the costs associated with redesigning their plans. By reevaluating the two-step process, and clearly distinguishing the critical components needed for preliminary approval from the more involved and detailed information required for final approval, this bill intends to enable applicants to secure preliminary approval of the overall layout of a proposed site plan or subdivision before incurring the expense of preparing detailed engineering plans, specifications, and analyses.  This change is meant to reduce the possibility of animosity between applicants, boards, and the general public, by positioning applicants to be more receptive to revise their plans in response to public opinion and comments from planning board members. Specifically, the bill provides that a planning boards review of an application for development for preliminary approval of a site plan would be limited to the following criteria: · the  layout and arrangement of proposed buildings, streets, parking, and other proposed site improvements; and · compliance with the use, density, floor area ratio, height, and other zoning standards applicable to the zoning district. Similarly, under the bill, a planning boards review of an application for development for preliminary approval of a subdivision would be limited to the following criteria: · the layout and arrangement of proposed lots, as well as any proposed streets, parking, known easements, and other proposed site improvements; and · compliance with the use, density, and other zoning standards applicable to the zoning district. The bill requires developers to include requests for any C variances from zoning ordinance provisions governing these criteria in their applications for preliminary approval.  The bill allows developers to include requests for other C variances in their applications for preliminary approval, or to defer those variance requests until final approval.  The bill defers review relative to assessment of contributions for off-tract improvements until final approval. The bill details the documents and information that an applicant for preliminary approval of a site plan or subdivision may be required to submit for the application to be considered complete for the planning board's consideration.  The bill authorizes planning boards to request additional reasonably necessary information, if an application for preliminary approval includes a request for a C variance. The bill shortens the period of time within which a board must grant or deny an application for preliminary approval of more extensive projects (site plans involving more than 10 acres or more than 10 dwelling units, and subdivisions of more than 10 lots) from 95 to 75 days after the date on which a complete application for development is submitted. The bill specifies four circumstances that require a developer to submit an application to amend a preliminary approval.  A developer must submit an application for development for amended preliminary approval of a site plan if, after the grant of preliminary site plan approval, the developer seeks to: · make any substantial revisions to the layout of improvements; · increase the density for residential development by more than 10 percent or the floor area ratio for nonresidential development by more than 10 percent; · make any change to the site plan that requires a variance from a zoning ordinance governing criteria subject to review in connection with an application for development for preliminary approval; or · make any change to the site plan that affects the basis upon which any variance had been granted. A developer must submit an application for development for amended preliminary approval of a subdivision if, after the grant of preliminary subdivision approval, the developer seeks to: · make any substantial revisions to the layout of improvements; · increase the density for residential development by more than 10 percent; · make any change to the subdivision plat that requires a variance from a zoning ordinance governing criteria subject to review in connection with an application for development for preliminary approval of a subdivision; or · make any change to the subdivision that affects the basis upon which any variance had been granted. The bill provides that a developer may, at its option, submit an application for preliminary approval, or an application to amend a preliminary approval, simultaneous with an application for final approval.  In this case, the bill requires a planning board to simultaneously review and act upon the applications for preliminary approval, amended preliminary approval, and final approval. Under the bill, a developer seeking to construct site infrastructure improvements prior to a grant of final approval must specifically request authorization to do so in its application for preliminary approval.  Under this circumstance, the bill requires the applicant to submit the required plans and specification for the proposed site infrastructure improvements as well as other information as is reasonably required by the planning board to determine whether the proposed site infrastructure improvements are adequate.  A preliminary approval authorizing a developer to construct site infrastructure improvements prior to final approval must specifically so provide in the resolution of approval. To allow sufficient time for completion of the detailed engineering plans and outside agency approvals associated with final approval of subdivisions and site plans, the bill extends the vesting period for preliminary approvals from three years to five years. However, with regard to a preliminary approval that authorizes construction of site improvements prior to final approval, the bill retains the three-year vesting period. The bill would amend the statute governing the standards for final approval of site plans and major subdivisions by requiring a planning board to grant final approval if the detailed drawings, specifications and estimates of the application for final approval: · conform to the standards established by ordinance for final approval; · conform in all material respects with the conditions of preliminary approval; and · in the case of a major subdivision, conform to the statutory requirements for approval or filing of a map. However, the bill provides that, in granting final approval of a site plan or major subdivision, a planning board must: · permit changes to a preliminary approval that do not require the developer to submit an application to amend the preliminary approval; and · consider and may grant requests for C variances that may, under the bill, be deferred until final approval. The bill would expand the time within which a board must grant or deny final approval from 45 days to 95 days after submission of a complete application for final approval. The bill specifies that its provisions do not supersede or relieve an applicant from satisfying a countys land development procedures and standards, nor supersede, or relieve a municipal approving authority from complying with, provisions of the County Planning Act, N.J.S.A. 40:27-1 et seq.
