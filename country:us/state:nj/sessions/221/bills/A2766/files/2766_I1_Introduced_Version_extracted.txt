When imposing any penalty under the provisions of this subsection, the court having jurisdiction shall be guided by the appropriate provisions of any statute fixing uniform penalties for violation of provisions of the motor vehicle and traffic laws contained in Title 39 of the Revised Statutes. m.   In any prosecution for violating a regulation of the authority adopted pursuant to the provisions of this section, copies of that regulation when authenticated under the seal of the authority by its secretary or assistant secretary shall be evidence in like manner and equal effect as the original. n.    No resolution or ordinance adopted by the governing body of any county or municipality for the control and regulation of traffic shall be applicable to vehicles while upon any expressway project operated by the authority. o.    In addition to any punishment or penalty provided by other subsections of this section, every registration certificate and every license certificate to drive motor vehicles may be suspended or revoked, and any person may be prohibited from obtaining a driver's license or a registration certificate, and the reciprocity privileges of a nonresident may be suspended or revoked by the [Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles] Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission for a violation of any of the provisions of this section, after due notice in writing of the proposed suspension, revocation, or prohibition and the ground thereof, all otherwise in accordance with the powers, practice, and procedure established by the provisions of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes applicable to the suspension, revocation, or prohibition. p.    Except as otherwise provided by this section or by any regulation of the authority adopted in accordance with the provisions of this section, the requirements of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes applicable to persons using, driving, or operating vehicles on the public highways of this State and to vehicles so used, driven, or operated shall be applicable to persons using, driving, or operating vehicles on any expressway project and to vehicles so used, driven or operated.

Currently, employees of the authority are given toll-free passage on the Expressway for purposes relating to their employment with the authority as well as for personal trips.
