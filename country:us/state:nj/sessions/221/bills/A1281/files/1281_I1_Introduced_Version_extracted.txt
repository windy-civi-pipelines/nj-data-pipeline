This bill would amend current law to require a school district to receive written permission from a parent or legal guardian, rather than providing notification, prior to administering an anonymous, voluntary survey, assessment, analysis or evaluation to a student concerning the use of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and vaping; sexual behavior and attitudes; behaviors that may contribute to intentional or unintentional injuries or violence; or physical activity and nutrition-related behaviors.
