STATEMENT Under current law, to be considered a veteran and eligible for certain State civil service preference benefits and pension benefits as a public employee, a person must have served during specific dates or in specific locations. This bill changes the definition of veteran and removes the requirement of service during specified dates or in specified locations for the civil service preference benefits and the pension provisions of the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF), the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS), the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), and the State Police Retirement System (SPRS). Under this bill, a veteran will be defined as any resident of this State released under other than dishonorable conditions from active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States, a Reserve component thereof, or the New Jersey National Guard in a federal active duty status. Todays modern military requires the essential services of all military and Reserve personnel, regardless of location or duty assignment, to fulfill the militarys mission in time of war or peace.  The purpose of this bill is to recognize that all military personnel, regardless of their location or assigned duties serve our nation.  Military personnel who served domestically, including responders to 9-11, served our nation and should be considered veterans for pension and civil service purposes.

STATEMENT Under current law, to be considered a veteran and eligible for certain State civil service preference benefits and pension benefits as a public employee, a person must have served during specific dates or in specific locations. This bill changes the definition of veteran and removes the requirement of service during specified dates or in specified locations for the civil service preference benefits and the pension provisions of the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF), the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS), the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), and the State Police Retirement System (SPRS). Under this bill, a veteran will be defined as any resident of this State released under other than dishonorable conditions from active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States, a Reserve component thereof, or the New Jersey National Guard in a federal active duty status. Todays modern military requires the essential services of all military and Reserve personnel, regardless of location or duty assignment, to fulfill the militarys mission in time of war or peace.  The purpose of this bill is to recognize that all military personnel, regardless of their location or assigned duties serve our nation.  Military personnel who served domestically, including responders to 9-11, served our nation and should be considered veterans for pension and civil service purposes.
