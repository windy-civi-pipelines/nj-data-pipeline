A rare disease is generally considered to be a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States at any given time. Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) Deficiency is a life-limiting, severely debilitating genetic neurologic rare disease that significantly impacts a patients development, motor skills, growth, cognition, and language skills. While some patients who are born with AADC Deficiency may be asymptomatic at birth, AADC patients typically experience symptoms within the first year of life such as developmental delay and involuntary eye movements. Caregivers of patients with AADC Deficiency are often responsible for the overall care of the patient due to the debilitating nature of this disease and patients may need life-long care. The State of New Jersey can raise awareness of AADC Deficiency in the public and medical communities within this State in order to support individuals with AADC Deficiency and their caregivers by designating this awareness day.
