The restriction in section 2 of P.L.1947, c.94 (C.33:1-12.14) concerning the number of retail consumption licenses that may be issued in a municipality shall not be applicable to the license issued under this subsection. As used in this subsection, Private event means an event that is hosted by a bona fide member of a veterans service organization and is held on the licensed premises for an unlimited number of guests of the bona fide member in exchange for a fee and may including, but not limited to, a wedding, anniversary, bar mitzvah, or other social function; and Veterans service organization means the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, or other veterans' organizations chartered under federal law, or any service foundation of such an organization recognized in its bylaws. (cf: P.L.2024, c.73, s.6) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment, but the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control may take any anticipatory action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill establishes a veterans service organization license that would allow certain veteran organizations to sell alcoholic beverages on the licensed premises and only to bona fide members of a veterans service organization, guests of a bona fide member, affiliated bona fide members of other veteran service organizations, and members of auxiliary organizations that are allied with other veterans service organizations.  The bill defines veterans service organization as the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, or other veterans' organizations chartered under federal law, or any service foundation of such an organization recognized in its bylaws. Under current law, these veteran organizations may obtain a club license to serve alcoholic beverages to members and guests but are prohibited from serving alcoholic beverages to auxiliary and affiliated members. Under the bill, a bona fide member of a veterans service organization would be permitted to have not more than nine individuals as guests on any one occasion and host private events.  The bill prohibits affiliated and auxiliary members from having guests and hosting private events on the premises of a veterans service organization at which they are not a member.  A bona fide member who hosts a private event would be required to provide all of the alcoholic beverages which are to be purchased off the licensed premises. The license holder would be prohibited from selling alcoholic beverages or charging a fee for the consumption of alcoholic beverages at a private event but would be allowed sell food and non-alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed premises.
