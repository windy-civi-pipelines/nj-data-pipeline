Under current law, the boards of trustees of the State colleges and three of the States public research universities, Rowan University, Montclair State University, and Kean University, are required to include two student representatives elected by the student body or student government association, as applicable.  Currently, the statutes governing these public institutions of higher education require each student representative to be a citizen of the United States.  Under this bill, a student representative would no longer be required to be a United States citizen.
