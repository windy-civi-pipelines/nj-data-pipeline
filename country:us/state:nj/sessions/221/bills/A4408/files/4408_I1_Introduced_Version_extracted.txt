As used in this section, the term residential dwelling means a permanent structure intended as and currently being utilized as a residence by a private person or persons. For the purposes of paragraph (3) of this subsection, it is not an element of the offense that the actor knew that any other person was present in the dwelling when the actor entered or surreptitiously remained in the dwelling, and it shall not be a defense that the actor did not know that any other person was present in the residential dwelling when the actor entered or surreptitiously remained in the dwelling. Residential dwellings shall have the meaning set forth in Section 1 of P.L.    , c.

Upon the determination that a juvenile has committed an act of delinquency or that a juvenile-family crisis exists, the court may impose such disposition or dispositions over those persons subject to its jurisdiction consistent with the purposes of this act. Such jurisdiction shall extend in these matters over a juvenile and his parent, guardian or any family member found by the court to be contributing to a juvenile-family crisis.  The court shall, in accordance with the Rules of Court, clearly specify the responsibilities of those subject to its jurisdiction with respect to the plan of rehabilitation for the juvenile. b.     The court shall have jurisdiction in respect to the custody of any juvenile who may be held as a material witness in any case pending in the court.  Whenever a juvenile is a material witness in any other court, the procedures established by this act shall be followed. c.     Juveniles who appear before the court in any capacity shall be deemed to be wards of the court and protected accordingly. d.     Nothing in this act shall affect the jurisdiction of other courts over offenses committed after a juvenile under the jurisdiction of the court reaches the age of 18 years. e.     A juvenile accused of a delinquency complaint related to home invasion or carjacking shall appear before the court and be tried in the county where the incident giving rise to the complaint allegedly occurred. (cf: P.L.1982, c.77, s.5) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill creates the first degree crime of home invasion and upgrades burglary of a residence to a second degree crime under certain circumstances.  In addition, this bill requires juveniles accused of carjacking or home invasion to appear before the court and be tried in the county where alleged delinquency occurred. Specifically, under the provisions of the bill, a person commits the crime of home invasion if he or she enters a persons residence with the intent to commit a robbery, a first or second degree crime, or certain kidnapping and sexual crimes or offenses when another person or persons are present and the actor: 1) uses force or inflicts bodily injury on a person in the residence; 2) threatens a person in the residence with, or purposely or knowingly, puts the person in fear of immediate bodily injury; 3) commits, attempts to commit, or threatens to commit any first or second degree crime or certain kidnapping and sexual crimes and offenses; or 4) is armed with or threatens the use of a deadly weapon or explosive. Under the bill, burglary is upgraded to a second degree crime if a person enters a residence when a resident or any other person, other than a person acting in concert with the actor, is present in the home.  The bill provides that knowledge that another person was in the home would not be an element of this upgraded crime, and it would not be a defense that the offender was unaware that another person was present in the home when they entered the residence.  The upgraded crime would be punishable by a term of imprisonment between five to 10 years, a fine up to $150,000, or both. Under the New Jersey court rules, juvenile delinquency complaints are filed in the county where the incident giving rise to the complaint allegedly occurred, but if the juvenile resides in a county other than the county of the alleged incident, the venue is set to be the county where the juvenile resides.  This bill requires a juvenile accused of carjacking or home invasion to appear before court and be tried in the county where the alleged delinquency occurred.
