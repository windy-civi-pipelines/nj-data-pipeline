The member may purchase service credit for the service by paying into the annuity savings fund the amount required by applying the factor, supplied by the actuary as being applicable to the members age at the time of the purchase, to the members salary at that time, or to the highest annual compensation for service in this State for which contributions were made during any prior fiscal year of membership, whichever is greater.  The purchase may be made in a lump sum or in regular monthly installments pursuant to formulas, rules, and regulations as the Division of Pensions and Benefits may establish.  At a minimum, the member shall submit to the division a statement of service, detailing the members time and the nature of service in the fellowship program, signed and attested to by the Director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics.

The employer shall not be liable for payment to the division for any payment to the division made for the purchase of this credit.  All contributions required with respect to the liability created by the purchase of this credit shall be made by the member. Any member electing to make a purchase pursuant to this section who retires prior to completing payments as agreed with the division will receive pro rata credit for the purchase prior to the date of retirement, but if the member so elects at the time of retirement and such request is approved by the division, the member may make the additional lump sum payment as required by the division at that time to provide full credit. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately.

The bill provides that the member will be required to submit to the Division of Pensions and Benefits a statement, signed and attested to by the Director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics, detailing their time and the nature of their service in the fellowship program. The member will not be eligible to purchase this additional service if the member has a vested right to retirement benefits in another retirement system based in whole or in part upon that service. The public employer will not be responsible for any contributions to the retirement system based upon the members prior service in the fellowship program.
