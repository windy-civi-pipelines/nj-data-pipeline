style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>1</span></sup></b><b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>1.  Section 12
of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-28) is amended to read as follows:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  a.  A victim may file a
complaint alleging the commission of an act of domestic violence with the
Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court in conformity with
the Rules of Court.  The court shall not dismiss any complaint or delay
disposition of a case because the victim has left the residence to avoid
further incidents of domestic violence.  Filing a complaint pursuant to this
section shall not prevent the filing of a criminal complaint for the same act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     On weekends, holidays and
other times when the court is closed, a victim may file a complaint before a
judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court or a
municipal court judge who shall be assigned to accept complaints and issue
emergency, ex parte relief in the form of temporary restraining orders pursuant
to this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A plaintiff may apply for relief
under this section in a court having jurisdiction over the place where the
alleged act of domestic violence occurred, where the defendant resides, or
where the plaintiff resides or is sheltered, and the court shall follow the
same procedures applicable to other emergency applications.  Criminal
complaints filed pursuant to this act shall be investigated and prosecuted in
the jurisdiction where the offense is alleged to have occurred.  Contempt
complaints filed pursuant to N.J.S.2C:29-9 shall be prosecuted in the county
where the contempt is alleged to have been committed and a copy of the contempt
complaint shall be forwarded to the court that issued the order alleged to have
been violated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The court shall waive
any requirement that the petitioner's place of residence appear on the
complaint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)  The clerk of the
court, or other person designated by the court, shall assist the parties in
completing any forms necessary for the filing of a summons, complaint, answer
or other pleading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The plaintiff may
provide information concerning firearms to which the defendant has access,
including the location of these firearms, if known, on a form to be prescribed
by the Administrative Director of the Courts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Information provided by
the plaintiff concerning firearms to which the defendant has access shall be
kept confidential and shall not be disseminated or disclosed, provided that
nothing in this subsection shall prohibit dissemination or disclosure of this
information in a manner consistent with and in furtherance of the purpose for
which the information was provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Summons and complaint
forms shall be readily available at the clerk's office, at the municipal courts
and at municipal and State police stations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     As soon as the domestic
violence complaint is filed, both the victim and the abuser shall be advised of
any programs or services available for advice and counseling <u>as well as any
programs or services available for counseling for any minor children who were
either physically present at the time of the alleged act of domestic violence
or who may have seen or heard the alleged act of domestic violence</u>.<u>  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A plaintiff may seek
emergency, ex parte relief in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A
municipal court judge or a judge of the Family Part of the Chancery Division of
the Superior Court may enter an ex parte order when necessary to protect the

plaintiff is in danger of domestic violence, the judge shall, upon
consideration of the plaintiff's domestic violence complaint, order emergency
ex parte relief, in the nature of a temporary restraining order.  A decision
shall be made by the judge regarding the emergency relief forthwith.</p>

temporary restraining order upon sworn testimony or complaint of an applicant
who is not physically present, pursuant to court rules, or by a person who
represents a person who is physically or mentally incapable of filing personally. 
A temporary restraining order may be issued if the judge is satisfied that
exigent circumstances exist sufficient to excuse the failure of the applicant
to appear personally and that sufficient grounds for granting the application
have been shown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     An order for emergency,
ex parte relief shall be granted upon good cause shown and shall remain in

the record before any judge of the Family Part of the county in which the
plaintiff resides or is sheltered if that judge issued the temporary order or
has access to the reasons for the issuance of the temporary order and sets
forth in the record the reasons for the modification or dissolution.  The
denial of a temporary restraining order by a municipal court judge and
subsequent administrative dismissal of the complaint shall not bar the victim
from refiling a complaint in the Family Part based on the same incident and
receiving an emergency, ex parte hearing de novo not on the record before a
Family Part judge, and every denial of relief by a municipal court judge shall
so state.</p>

seizure of any firearm or other weapon at any location where the judge has
reasonable cause to believe the weapon is located and the seizure of any
firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun issued

accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if necessary, to
the scene of the domestic violence or any other location where the judge has
reasonable cause to believe any firearm or other weapon belonging to the
defendant is located, to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any
firearm or other weapon, and that the firearm or other weapon is appropriately
surrendered in accordance with the order.  If the order prohibits the defendant
from returning to the scene of domestic violence or any other location where
the judge has reasonable cause to believe any firearm or other weapon belonging
to the defendant is located, any firearm or other weapon located there shall be
seized by a law enforcement officer.  The order shall include notice to the
defendant of the penalties for a violation of any provision of the order,
including but not limited to the penalties for contempt of court and unlawful
possession of a firearm or other weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5.  Other
appropriate relief may include but is not limited to an order directing the
possession of any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either
party or a minor child residing in the household and providing that the animal
shall not be disposed of prior to entry of a final order pursuant to section 13

good cause is shown for the hearing to be held elsewhere.  A copy of the
complaint shall be served on the defendant in conformity with the Rules of
Court.  If a criminal complaint arising out of the same incident which is the
subject matter of a complaint brought under P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et seq.)
or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.) has been filed, testimony given by the
plaintiff or defendant in the domestic violence matter shall not be used in the
simultaneous or subsequent criminal proceeding against the defendant, other
than domestic violence contempt matters and where it would otherwise be admissible
hearsay under the rules of evidence that govern where a party is unavailable. 
At the hearing the standard for proving the allegations in the complaint shall
be by a preponderance of the evidence.  The court shall consider but not be
limited to the following factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The previous history of
domestic violence between the plaintiff and defendant, including threats,
harassment and physical abuse; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The existence of
immediate danger to person or property; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An order issued under this act
shall only restrain or provide damages payable from a person against whom a
complaint has been filed under this act and only after a finding or an
admission is made that an act of domestic violence was committed by that
person.  The issue of whether or not a violation of this act occurred,
including an act of contempt under this act, shall not be subject to mediation
or negotiation in any form.  In addition, where a temporary or final order has
been issued pursuant to this act, no party shall be ordered to participate in
mediation on the issue of custody or parenting time.</p>

complaints for restraining orders have been filed, the court shall grant any
relief necessary to prevent further abuse.  In addition to any other

or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a
handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3 during the period in which the restraining
order is in effect or two years, whichever is greater.  The order shall require
the immediate surrender of any firearm or other weapon belonging to the

firearm or other weapon, and a law enforcement officer shall take custody of
any firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant.  If the order prohibits
the defendant from returning to the scene of domestic violence or other place
where firearms or other weapons belonging to the defendant are located, any
firearm or other weapon located there shall be seized by a law enforcement
officer.  The provisions of this subsection requiring the surrender or removal
of a firearm, card, or permit shall not apply to any law enforcement officer
while actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United
States or member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to
or from an authorized place of duty.  At the hearing the judge of the Family
Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court may issue an order granting
any or all of the following relief:  </p>

exclusive possession to the plaintiff of the residence or household regardless
of whether the residence or household is jointly or solely owned by the parties
or jointly or solely leased by the parties.  This order shall not in any manner
affect title or interest to any real property held by either party or both
jointly.  If it is not possible for the victim to remain in the residence, the
court may order the defendant to pay the victim's rent at a residence other
than the one previously shared by the parties if the defendant is found to have
a duty to support the victim and the victim requires alternative housing.  </p>

parenting time.  The order shall protect the safety and well-being of the
plaintiff and minor children and shall specify the place and frequency of
parenting time. Parenting time arrangements shall not compromise any other
remedy provided by the court by requiring or encouraging contact between the
plaintiff and defendant.  Orders for parenting time may include a designation
of a place of parenting time away from the plaintiff, the participation of a
third party, or supervised parenting time.</p>

a person with parenting time rights to a child in the parent's custody for an
investigation or evaluation <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>by
the appropriate agency<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>

made if the judge finds the request to be arbitrary or capricious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The court shall consider
suspension of the parenting time order and hold an emergency hearing upon an
application made by the plaintiff certifying under oath that the defendant's

defendant to pay to the victim monetary compensation for losses suffered as a
direct result of the act of domestic violence.  The order may require the

Compensation Office for any and all compensation paid by the Victims of Crime
Compensation Office directly to or on behalf of the victim, and may require
that the defendant reimburse any parties that may have compensated the victim,
as the court may determine. Compensatory losses shall include, but not be
limited to, loss of earnings or other support, including child or spousal
support, out-of-pocket losses for injuries sustained, cost of repair or
replacement of real or personal property damaged or destroyed or taken by the
defendant, cost of counseling for the victim, moving or other travel expenses,
reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and compensation for pain and
suffering. Where appropriate, punitive damages may be awarded in addition to
compensatory damages.</p>

defendant to receive professional domestic violence counseling from either a
private source or a source appointed by the court and, in that event, requiring
the defendant to provide the court at specified intervals with documentation of
attendance at the professional counseling.  The court may order the defendant
to pay for the professional counseling.  No application by the defendant to
dissolve a final order which contains a requirement for attendance at
professional counseling pursuant to this paragraph shall be granted by the
court unless, in addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions
ordered by the court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at
such counseling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   An order restraining the
defendant from entering the residence, property, school, or place of employment
of the victim or of other family or household members of the victim and
requiring the defendant to stay away from any specified place that is named in
the order and is frequented regularly by the victim or other family or
household members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   An order restraining the
defendant from making contact with the plaintiff or others, including an order
forbidding the defendant from personally or through an agent initiating any

members, or their employers, employees, or fellow workers, or others with whom
communication would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm to the victim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   An order requiring that
the defendant make or continue to make rent or mortgage payments on the
residence occupied by the victim if the defendant is found to have a duty to

another action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   An order granting either
party temporary possession of specified personal property, such as an

emergency monetary relief, including emergency support for minor children, to
the victim and other dependents, if any.  An ongoing obligation of support

firearm or other weapon, and that the firearm or other weapon is appropriately
surrendered in accordance with the order. If the order prohibits the defendant
from returning to the scene of domestic violence or any other location where
the judge has reasonable cause to believe any firearm or other weapon belonging
to the defendant is located, any firearm or other weapon located there shall be
seized by a law enforcement officer. The order shall include notice to the
defendant of the penalties for a violation of any provision of the order,
including but not limited to the penalties for contempt of court and unlawful
possession of a firearm or other weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5. Other
appropriate relief may include but is not limited to an order directing the
possession of any animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either
party or a minor child residing in the household and providing that the animal
shall not be disposed of prior to entry of a final order pursuant to section 13

Section 13 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-29) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     13.  a.  A hearing shall be
held in the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court within
10 days of the filing of a complaint pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261
(C.2C:25-28) in the county where the ex parte restraints were ordered, unless
good cause is shown for the hearing to be held elsewhere.  A copy of the
complaint shall be served on the defendant in conformity with the Rules of
Court. If a criminal complaint arising out of the same incident which is the
subject matter of a complaint brought under P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et seq.)
or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.) has been filed, testimony given by the
plaintiff or defendant in the domestic violence matter shall not be used in the
simultaneous or subsequent criminal proceeding against the defendant, other
than domestic violence contempt matters and where it would otherwise be
admissible hearsay under the rules of evidence that govern where a party is
unavailable.  At the hearing the standard for proving the allegations in the
complaint shall be by a preponderance of the evidence.  In considering the
necessity of ordering a restraining order the court shall consider but not be
limited to the following factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The previous history of
domestic violence between the plaintiff and defendant, including threats,
harassment and physical abuse; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The existence of
immediate danger to person or property; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The financial
circumstances of the plaintiff and defendant; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The best interests of

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The existence of a
verifiable order of protection from another jurisdiction; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Any pattern of coercive
control against a person that in purpose or effect unreasonably interferes
with, threatens, or exploits a person's liberty, freedom, bodily integrity, or
human rights with the court specifically considering evidence of the need for
protection from immediate danger or the prevention of further abuse.  If the
court finds that one or more factors of coercive control are more or less
relevant than others, the court shall make specific written findings of fact
and conclusions of law on the reasons why the court reached that conclusion. 
Coercive control may include, but shall not be limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  isolating the person from
friends, relatives, transportation, medical care, or other source of support;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  depriving the person of
basic necessities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)  monitoring the person's
movements, communications, daily behavior, finances, economic resources, or
access to services;</p>

force, threat, or intimidation, including, but not limited to, threats based on
actual or suspected immigration status;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)  threatening to make or
making baseless reports to the police, courts, the Division of Child Protection
and Permanency (DCPP) within the Department of Children and Families, the Board
of Social Services, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), or other
parties;</p>

interfere with an individual's custody or parenting time, other than through
enforcement of a valid custody arrangement or court order pursuant to current
law including, but not limited to, an order issued pursuant to Title 9 of the
Revised Statutes; or</p>

circumstances that the court deems relevant or material.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An order issued under this act
shall only restrain or provide damages payable from a person against whom a
complaint has been filed under this act and only after a finding or an
admission is made that an act of domestic violence was committed by that
person.  The issue of whether or not a violation of this act occurred,
including an act of contempt under this act, shall not be subject to mediation
or negotiation in any form.  In addition, where a temporary or final order has
been issued pursuant to this act, no party shall be ordered to participate in mediation
on the issue of custody or parenting time.</p>

section.</p>

complaints for restraining orders have been filed, the court shall grant any
relief necessary to prevent further abuse.  In addition to any other
provisions, any restraining order issued by the court shall bar the defendant
from purchasing, owning, possessing or controlling a firearm and from receiving
or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a
handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3 during the period in which the restraining
order is in effect or two years, whichever is greater. The order shall require
the immediate surrender of any firearm or other weapon belonging to the
defendant.  The order shall include notice to the defendant of the penalties
for a violation of any provision of the order, including but not limited to the
penalties for contempt of court and unlawful possession of a firearm or other
weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A law enforcement officer
shall accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if
necessary, to any place where any firearm or other weapon belonging to the
defendant is located to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any
firearm or other weapon, and a law enforcement officer shall take custody of
any firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant.  If the order prohibits
the defendant from returning to the scene of domestic violence or other place
where firearms or other weapons belonging to the defendant are located, any
firearm or other weapon located there shall be seized by a law enforcement
officer.  The provisions of this subsection requiring the surrender or removal
of a firearm, card, or permit shall not apply to any law enforcement officer
while actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United
States or member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to
or from an authorized place of duty.  At the hearing the judge of the Family
Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court may issue an order granting
any or all of the following relief:  </p>

of whether the residence or household is jointly or solely owned by the parties
or jointly or solely leased by the parties.  This order shall not in any manner
affect title or interest to any real property held by either party or both
jointly.  If it is not possible for the victim to remain in the residence, the
court may order the defendant to pay the victim's rent at a residence other
than the one previously shared by the parties if the defendant is found to have
a duty to support the victim and the victim requires alternative housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  An order that the
landlord of a residential dwelling unit shall change the locks on the dwelling

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   An order providing for
parenting time.  The order shall protect the safety and well-being of the
plaintiff and minor children and shall specify the place and frequency of
parenting time. Parenting time arrangements shall not compromise any other
remedy provided by the court by requiring or encouraging contact between the
plaintiff and defendant.  Orders for parenting time may include a designation
of a place of parenting time away from the plaintiff, the participation of a
third party, or supervised parenting time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The court shall consider
a request by a custodial parent who has been subjected to domestic violence by
a person with parenting time rights to a child in the parent's custody for an
investigation or evaluation <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>by
the appropriate agency<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
to assess the risk of harm to the child prior to the entry of a parenting time
order.  Any denial of such a request must be on the record and shall only be
made if the judge finds the request to be arbitrary or capricious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The court shall consider
suspension of the parenting time order and hold an emergency hearing upon an
application made by the plaintiff certifying under oath that the defendant's
access to the child pursuant to the parenting time order has threatened the
safety and well-being of the child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) An order requiring the
defendant to pay to the victim monetary compensation for losses suffered as a
direct result of the act of domestic violence.  The order may require the

Compensation Office directly to or on behalf of the victim, and may require
that the defendant reimburse any parties that may have compensated the victim,
as the court may determine. Compensatory losses shall include, but not be
limited to, loss of earnings or other support, including child or spousal
support, out-of-pocket losses for injuries sustained, cost of repair or
replacement of real or personal property damaged or destroyed or taken by the

defendant to receive professional domestic violence counseling from either a
private source or a source appointed by the court and, in that event, requiring
the defendant to provide the court at specified intervals with documentation of
attendance at the professional counseling.  The court may order the defendant
to pay for the professional counseling.  No application by the defendant to
dissolve a final order which contains a requirement for attendance at
professional counseling pursuant to this paragraph shall be granted by the
court unless, in addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions
ordered by the court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at
such counseling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   An order restraining the

communication would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm to the victim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   An order requiring that
the defendant make or continue to make rent or mortgage payments on the
residence occupied by the victim if the defendant is found to have a duty to

another action.</p>

required by this subsection prohibiting the defendant from possessing any
firearm, the court may also issue an order prohibiting the defendant from
possessing any other weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and
