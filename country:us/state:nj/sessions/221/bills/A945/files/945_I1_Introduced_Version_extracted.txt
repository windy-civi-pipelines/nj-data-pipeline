STATEMENT This bill prohibits the payment by the State, local governments, and boards of education of supplemental compensation to any current or future public officer or employee for accumulated unused sick leave earned after the bills effective date. Supplemental compensation for any time earned prior to that date will be payable as under current law.  In addition, the bill provides that the payment of supplemental compensation for unused sick leave will be suspended if an officer or employee is indicted for any of the crimes which under current law are grounds for pension forfeiture and that supplemental compensation will be forfeited upon conviction.  The bill also requires all public officers and employees to provide medical documentation for absences of six or more consecutive days and imposes penalties for the failure to do so. The bill requires the Attorney General to develop guidelines or establish procedures to ensure that public employers are notified when a public officer or employee is indicted for, or convicted of, any crime or offense that triggers the suspension or forfeiture of payment for supplemental compensation.  It also provides that the suspension or forfeiture of payment for supplemental compensation will apply only in the case of crimes or offenses committed after the bills effective date. The bill will take effect on the first day of the second month following enactment.

The bill will take effect on the first day of the second month following enactment.
