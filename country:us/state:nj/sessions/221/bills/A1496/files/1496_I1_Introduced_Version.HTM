c.142 (C.39:3-84.3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    a. Officers shall have
authority as set forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection to
require the driver, operator, owner, lessee<u>,</u> or bailee of any vehicle or
combination of vehicles found on any public road, street, or highway or any
public or quasi-public property in this State to facilitate and permit the
measurement or weighing of the vehicle or combination of vehicles, including
load or contents, for the purpose of determining whether the size or weight of
the vehicle or combination of vehicles, including load or contents, is in
excess of that permitted in this Title: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Officers of the Division
of State Police shall have the exclusive authority to conduct random roadside
examinations for the purpose of determining whether size or weight is in excess
of that permitted in this Title, and officers of the Division of State Police
shall have the authority, with or without probable cause to believe that the
size or weight is in excess of that permitted, to require the driver, operator,
owner, lessee<u>,</u> or bailee, to stop, drive or otherwise move to a location
for measurement or weighing and submit the vehicle or combination of vehicles,
including load or contents, to measurement or weighing; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Police or peace officers
or inspectors appointed by any municipality or county shall have the authority
to require the driver, operator, owner, lessee<u>,</u> or bailee to stop, drive<u>,</u>
or otherwise move to a location for measurement or weighing and submit the
vehicle or combination of vehicles, including load or contents, to measurement
or weighing, only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the size or

provided in P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as
this bill), the</u> Division of State Police and the director shall have the
exclusive authority to establish and operate locations for the measurement and
weighing of vehicles, including load and contents, and all measuring and
weighing devices or scales employed at such locations shall be approved and
certified by the State Superintendent of Weights and Measures or the State
Superintendent's agent.  Copies of documents displaying the State
Superintendent's seal or certification shall be prima facie evidence of the
reliability and accuracy of the measuring or weighing devices or scales
utilized. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Whenever the officer,
upon measuring or weighing a vehicle or combination of vehicles, including load
or contents, determines that the size or weight is in excess of the limits permitted
in this Title, the officer or inspector shall require the driver, operator,
owner, lessee<u>,</u> or bailee to stop the vehicle or combination of vehicles
in a suitable place and remain in that place until a portion of the load or
contents of the vehicle or combination of vehicles is removed by the driver,
operator, owner, lessee, bailee<u>,</u> or duly appointed agent thereof, as may
be necessary to conform or reduce the size or weight of the vehicle or
combination of vehicles, including load or contents, to those limits as
permitted under this act, or permitted by the certificate of registration for
the vehicle or combination of vehicles, whichever may be lower.  All materials
so unloaded or removed shall be cared for by the driver, owner, operator,
lessee<u>,</u> or bailee of the vehicle or combination of vehicles, or duly
appointed agent thereof, at the risk, responsibility<u>,</u> and liability of
the driver, owner, operator, lessee, bailee<u>,</u> or duly appointed agent
thereof.  </p>

combination of vehicles shall be deemed to be in violation of the weight
limitation provision of this act, when, upon examination by the officer, <u>or
presented in defense to an enforcement action for a violation documented by a
weigh-in-motion monitoring system pursuant to P.L.    , c.     (C.        )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill),</u> the dispatch papers for the
vehicle or combination of vehicles, including load or contents, show it is
proceeding from its last preceding freight pickup point within the State of New
Jersey by a reasonably expeditious route to the nearest available scales or to
the first available scales in the general direction towards which the vehicle
or combination of vehicles has been dispatched, or is returning from such
scales after weighing-in to the last preceding pickup point.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    When the officer
determines that a vehicle or combination of vehicles, including load or
contents, is in violation of the weight limitations of this Title as provided
at paragraph (1) of subsection b. of R.S.39:3-84; paragraph (2) of subsection
b. of R.S.39:3-84; paragraph (3) of subsection b. of R.S.39:3-84; or paragraph
(5) of subsection b. of R.S.39:3-84 relative to maximum gross axle weights, but
is within the permissible maximum gross vehicle weight of this Title as provided
at paragraph (4) of subsection b. of R.S.39:3-84 or paragraph (5) of subsection
b. of R.S.39:3-84, whichever is applicable, the driver, operator, owner,
lessee, bailee<u>,</u> or duly appointed agent thereof shall be permitted,
before proceeding, to redistribute the weight of the vehicle or combination of
vehicles or the load or contents of the vehicle or combination of vehicles so
that no axle or combination of consecutive axles are in excess of the limits
set by this act, in which event there is no violation.  </p>
