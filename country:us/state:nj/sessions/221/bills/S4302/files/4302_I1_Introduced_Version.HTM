If it appears to the prosecutor that the deportation of a person arrested subject to subsection a. of this section will adversely affect the investigation or prosecution of the crime for which the person has been arrested, or will prevent the person from providing relevant information or serving as a material witness for the investigation or prosecution of another crime, the prosecutor may seek a stay of removal as provided for under federal law. f.

P.L.2021, c.199 (C.30:4-8.15 and C.30:4-8.16) is repealed. 4. This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill, to be known as the New Jersey Laken Riley Act, establishes law enforcement procedures for cases where an alien unlawfully present in the United States is arrested and charged with certain crimes. Under the bill, an alien who is confirmed by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to be an alien unlawfully present in the United States, and who is arrested for certain crimes, is presumed to require pretrial detention, notwithstanding the States Criminal Justice Reform Law (also known as bail reform).  The applicable crimes are any indictable crime of the first, second, third, or fourth degree; any motor vehicle violation involving bodily injury to another person; or any crime defined under federal law as an aggravated felony, serious criminal offense, or crime of violence. Additionally, the bill reforms certain law enforcement practices concerning illegal immigration.  First, the bill expressly authorizes and requires law enforcement officers to comply with immigration detainers requested by DHS.  Second, the bill expressly authorizes law enforcement agencies to enter into voluntary agreements with federal authorities to provide immigration enforcement services.  Third, the bill repeals the law banning prisons and jails in this State from serving as immigration detention facilities.  Finally, the bill directs the Attorney General to rescind A.G. Directive 2018-6 v.2.0, commonly known as the Immigrant Trust Directive, which was issued on Sept. 27, 2019. Through this bill, it is the intent of the sponsor to align State law with federal immigration law, particularly the federal Laken Riley Act, Pub.L.119-1, signed into law by the President on January 29, 2025.
