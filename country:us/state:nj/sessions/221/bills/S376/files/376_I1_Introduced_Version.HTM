Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)    a.   There
is created in the Department of Environmental Protection a special non-lapsing
fund to be known as the Flood Protection and Home Elevation Fund.  The money
in this fund is to be dedicated and shall be used only to carry out the purpose
specified in subsection b. of this section.  The fund shall be credited with
all revenues collected and deposited in the fund pursuant to section 4 of
P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-8), all interest and other income received from the
investment of money in the fund, and any money which, from time to time, may
otherwise become available for the purposes of the fund.  Pending the use
thereof pursuant to the provisions of subsection b. of this section, the money
deposited in the fund shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in public
depositories, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.236 (C.17:9-41),
and may be invested or reinvested in such securities as are approved by the
State Treasurer.  Interest or other income earned on monies deposited into the
fund shall be credited to the fund for use as set forth in subsection b. of
this section for other money in the fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Monies deposited in the
Flood Protection and Home Elevation Fund shall be used to reimburse a
homeowner who undertakes a home elevation project subsequent to the effective
date of this act in an amount equal to 25 percent of the annual interest
payment made by the homeowner on any loans taken to finance the home elevation
project, or $750, whichever is less; provided, however, that the county in
which the home elevation project takes place provides matching funds to the
homeowner in the same amount.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In order to qualify for
reimbursement pursuant to subsection b. of this section, a homeowner shall
first obtain all necessary State and local zoning and land use approvals for
the home elevation project, and approval from the financing institution for any
loan taken to finance the home elevation project.  The homeowner shall then
apply to the department and to the county on a form and in a manner established
by the department.  No payment shall be made by the State to the homeowner
until the home elevation is complete, and proof thereof to the satisfaction of
the department has been provided to the department.  A qualifying homeowner
shall be eligible to reapply to the State and county for reimbursement each
year the homeowner continues to pay interest on a loan taken to finance the
home elevation project.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Before a county provides
matching funds to homeowners pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the
governing body of the county shall establish, by ordinance or resolution, as
appropriate, a source of funding for the matching funds, which may include, but
need not be limited to, the county portion of the basic fee collected pursuant
to paragraph (1) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1968,&nbsp;c.49
(C.46:15-7) or county open space trust funds as specified in paragraph (1) of

would be used to reimburse a homeowner who undertakes a home elevation project
for 25 percent of the annual interest payment made by the homeowner on a loan
to finance the home elevation project, or $750, whichever is less.  However, a
homeowner will only be reimbursed if the county in which the home elevation
project takes place agrees to provide matching funds in the same amount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to qualify for
reimbursement, a homeowner would first need to obtain all necessary State and
local zoning and land use approvals for the home elevation project, as well as
approval from the financing institution for any loan taken to finance the
project.  The homeowner would then apply to the State and county for
reimbursement.  No payment would be made by the State to the homeowner until
the home elevation is complete and proof of completion has been submitted to
the department.  A qualifying homeowner would be eligible to reapply to the
State and county for reimbursement during each year the homeowner pays interest
on a loan taken to finance the home elevation project. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would dedicate up to
$5 million of the State share of the realty transfer fee annually to the Flood
Protection and Home Elevation Fund.  The fund would also be credited with all
interest and other income received from the investment of money in the fund. 
However, the bill provides that no money would be credited to the fund unless
$25 million of the State share of the realty transfer fee has first been
credited to the Shore Protection Fund, and $5 million of the State share of
the realty transfer fee has been credited to the Highlands Protection Fund,
both of which are required by current law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that, before a county can provide matching funds to homeowners for home
elevation projects, the county must first establish a source of funding, which
may include, but need not be limited to, the county share of the realty
transfer fee or county open space trust funds.  The bill would amend the county
open space trust fund law to explicitly allow counties to use trust funds for
home elevation projects pursuant to this bill.</p>
