(cf: P.L.2004, c.120, s.62) 6.    The Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall, in consultation with the State Treasurer, and in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt rules and regulations to implement P.L.    , c. (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including procedures and standards of eligibility for reimbursement pursuant to section 1 of P.L. , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 7.    This act shall take effect immediately, but sections 1 through 5 shall apply to the fiscal years beginning on and after July 1 next following the date of its enactment. STATEMENT This bill would establish a special, non-lapsing fund within the Department of Environmental Protection to be known as the Flood Protection and Home Elevation Fund.  Monies in the fund would be used to reimburse a homeowner who undertakes a home elevation project for 25 percent of the annual interest payment made by the homeowner on a loan to finance the home elevation project, or $750, whichever is less.  However, a homeowner will only be reimbursed if the county in which the home elevation project takes place agrees to provide matching funds in the same amount. In order to qualify for reimbursement, a homeowner would first need to obtain all necessary State and local zoning and land use approvals for the home elevation project, as well as approval from the financing institution for any loan taken to finance the project.  The homeowner would then apply to the State and county for reimbursement.  No payment would be made by the State to the homeowner until the home elevation is complete and proof of completion has been submitted to the department.  A qualifying homeowner would be eligible to reapply to the State and county for reimbursement during each year the homeowner pays interest on a loan taken to finance the home elevation project. The bill would dedicate up to $5 million of the State share of the realty transfer fee annually to the Flood Protection and Home Elevation Fund.  The fund would also be credited with all interest and other income received from the investment of money in the fund. However, the bill provides that no money would be credited to the fund unless $25 million of the State share of the realty transfer fee has first been credited to the Shore Protection Fund, and $5 million of the State share of the realty transfer fee has been credited to the Highlands Protection Fund, both of which are required by current law. Finally, the bill provides that, before a county can provide matching funds to homeowners for home elevation projects, the county must first establish a source of funding, which may include, but need not be limited to, the county share of the realty transfer fee or county open space trust funds.  The bill would amend the county open space trust fund law to explicitly allow counties to use trust funds for home elevation projects pursuant to this bill.

(d)   Selection of historic preservation projects shall be in accordance with a historic preservation plan prepared and adopted by the county.

(cf: P.L.2011, c.173, s.2) 4.    Section 4 of P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-8) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a.   The proceeds of the fees collected by the county recording officer, as authorized by P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-5 et seq.), shall be accounted for and remitted to the county treasurer. b.    (1)   The county portion of the basic fee collected pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-7) shall be retained by the county treasurer for the use of the county.  The county may use all or a portion of this money to provide matching funds for home elevation projects pursuant to section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (2)   The State portion of the basic fee, the additional fee, and the general purpose fee shall be paid to the State Treasurer for the use of the State.  Payments shall be made to the State Treasurer on the tenth day of each month following the month of collection. c.     (1)   Amounts, not in excess of $25,000,000, paid during the State fiscal year to the State Treasurer from the payment of the State portion of the basic fee shall be credited to the "Shore Protection Fund" created pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1992, c.148 (C.13:19-16.1), in the manner established under that section.

(3)   In addition to the amounts credited to the Shore Protection Fund pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and the Highlands Protection Fund pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, amounts of up to $5,000,000, as determined by the department, paid during the State fiscal year to the State Treasurer from the payment of the State portion of the basic fee shall be credited to the Flood Protection and Home Elevation Fund, created pursuant to section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  No monies shall be credited to the Flood Protection and Home Elevation Fund pursuant to this paragraph unless the full amount of $25,000,000 has been credited to the Shore Protection Fund pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and the full amount of $5,000,000 has been credited to the Highlands Protection Fund pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. d.    All amounts paid to the State Treasurer from the  payment of the additional fee  shall be credited to the Neighborhood Preservation Nonlapsing Revolving Fund established pursuant to P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), in the manner established under section 20 thereof (C.52:27D-320). (cf: P.L.2004, c.120, s.61) 5.    Section 2 of P.L.1992, c.148 (C.46:15-10.2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.   The annual appropriations act for each State fiscal year shall, without other conditions, limitations or restrictions on the following: (1)   credit amounts paid to the State Treasurer, if any, in payment of fees collected pursuant to paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-7) to the "Shore Protection Fund" created pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1992, c.148 (C.13:19-16.1), the Neighborhood Preservation Nonlapsing Revolving Fund established pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-320), and the "Highlands Protection Fund" created pursuant to section 21 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-19), pursuant to the requirements of section 4 of P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-8); (2)   appropriate the balance of the "Shore Protection Fund" created pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1992, c.148 (C.13:19-16.1), for the purposes of that fund; (3)   appropriate the balance of the Neighborhood Preservation Nonlapsing Revolving Fund established pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-320), for the purposes of that fund; [and] (4)   appropriate the balance of the "Highlands Protection Fund" created pursuant to section 21 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-19), for the purposes of that fund ; and (5)   appropriate the balance of the Flood Protection and Home Elevation Fund created pursuant to section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), for the purposes of that fund . b.    If the requirements of subsection a. of this section are not met on the effective date of an annual appropriations act for the State fiscal year, or if an amendment or supplement to an annual appropriations act for the State fiscal year should violate any of the requirements of subsection a. of this section, the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury shall, not later than five days after the enactment of the annual appropriations act, or an amendment or supplement thereto, that violates any of the requirements of subsection a. of this section, certify to the Director of the Division of Taxation that the requirements of subsection a. of this section have not been met. (cf: P.L.2004, c.120, s.62) 6.    The Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall, in consultation with the State Treasurer, and in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt rules and regulations to implement P.L.    , c. (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including procedures and standards of eligibility for reimbursement pursuant to section 1 of P.L. , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 7.    This act shall take effect immediately, but sections 1 through 5 shall apply to the fiscal years beginning on and after July 1 next following the date of its enactment. STATEMENT This bill would establish a special, non-lapsing fund within the Department of Environmental Protection to be known as the Flood Protection and Home Elevation Fund.  Monies in the fund would be used to reimburse a homeowner who undertakes a home elevation project for 25 percent of the annual interest payment made by the homeowner on a loan to finance the home elevation project, or $750, whichever is less.  However, a homeowner will only be reimbursed if the county in which the home elevation project takes place agrees to provide matching funds in the same amount. In order to qualify for reimbursement, a homeowner would first need to obtain all necessary State and local zoning and land use approvals for the home elevation project, as well as approval from the financing institution for any loan taken to finance the project.  The homeowner would then apply to the State and county for reimbursement.  No payment would be made by the State to the homeowner until the home elevation is complete and proof of completion has been submitted to the department.  A qualifying homeowner would be eligible to reapply to the State and county for reimbursement during each year the homeowner pays interest on a loan taken to finance the home elevation project. The bill would dedicate up to $5 million of the State share of the realty transfer fee annually to the Flood Protection and Home Elevation Fund.  The fund would also be credited with all interest and other income received from the investment of money in the fund. However, the bill provides that no money would be credited to the fund unless $25 million of the State share of the realty transfer fee has first been credited to the Shore Protection Fund, and $5 million of the State share of the realty transfer fee has been credited to the Highlands Protection Fund, both of which are required by current law. Finally, the bill provides that, before a county can provide matching funds to homeowners for home elevation projects, the county must first establish a source of funding, which may include, but need not be limited to, the county share of the realty transfer fee or county open space trust funds.  The bill would amend the county open space trust fund law to explicitly allow counties to use trust funds for home elevation projects pursuant to this bill.
