HALL District 28 (Essex and Union) SYNOPSIS Establishes Office of the Advocate for Private Commuter Bus Service Customers and bill of rights for customers of private carriers operating motorbus regular route services. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act establishing an Office of the Advocate for Private Commuter Bus Service Customers and a bill of rights for customers of private carriers operating motorbus regular route services, and supplementing Title 56 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The provision of safe, adequate, and reliable public and private transportation services is vital to the economy of this State and to the health and financial welfare of its citizens. b.    The New Jersey Transit Corporation, its contract carriers, and various private carriers are responsible for providing motorbus regular route service to the people of New Jersey and serve a critical role by providing for the efficient movement of people within the State and to and from destinations outside of New Jersey. c.     The private companies that provide motorbus regular route service are providing a service that many New Jersey residents depend on in their everyday lives, and since there are few, if any, alternatives to the services provided by these companies, commuters are forced to continue using the services provided by private companies regardless of their adequacy and reliability. d.    The motorbus regular route service currently provided by certain private companies is inadequate and unreliable, causing commuters distress and loss of income for those who rely on that service to get them to work every day. e.     In protecting the health, safety, and welfare of the thousands of New Jersey residents who use commuter bus services provided by private companies, it is necessary and proper to ensure that those companies uphold their obligation to provide safe, adequate, and reliable services to their customers. f.     In order to ensure that private carriers operating motorbus regular route service provide safe, adequate, and reliable service to the people of this State, it is appropriate for this Legislature to enact a bill of rights for customers of privately operated motorbus regular route services which establishes basic rights and guarantees that protect the health, safety, and welfare of those customers. 2.    As used in P.L.    c. (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Advocate means the Advocate within the Office of the Advocate for Commuter Bus Service Customers. Division means the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Motorbus regular route service means and includes the operation of any motorbus or motorbuses on streets, public highways or other facilities, over a fixed route and between fixed termini on a regular schedule for the purpose of carrying passengers for hire or otherwise, in this State or between points in this State and points in other states. Office means the Office of the Advocate for Private Commuter Bus Service Customers. Operator means the person responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and operation of a motorbus providing motorbus regular route service. Private carrier or carrier means any private entity which offers motorbus regular route service. 3.    There is hereby established an Office of the Advocate for Private Commuter Bus Service Customers in the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. 4.    The Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs shall designate one or more employees of the division to serve in the office.  The director shall designate an Advocate for Private Commuter Bus Service Customers and shall provide for the organization of the office. 5.    In addition to other powers and duties vested in it by P.L.    c.    (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) or any other law, the office shall: a.     Assist customers in resolving problems with private carriers who offer motorbus regular route service; b.    Identify recurrent problems that customers have with private carriers and propose solutions to those problems; c.     Preserve and protect the rights of the customers of motorbus regular route service; d.    Promote open and direct communications between customers and the private carriers, including facilitating semi-annual public hearings at locations along the route or routes served by a private carrier that has been identified to have recurrent problems with and deficiencies in service; and e.     Investigate, attempt to resolve, and if necessary refer to the division or the Attorney General any matters or complaints received pursuant to P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 6.    The following consumer protections, obligations of private carriers, and basic expectations and guarantees of health, safety, and welfare are established as a bill of rights for customers of private carriers operating motorbus regular route service: a.     For all routes upon which a private carrier operates motorbus regular route service, a private carrier shall adhere to a published schedule by making all stops on-time, except in cases where delay is caused by an emergency, flood, storm event, natural disaster, or other act of God.  An operator for a private carrier shall make each and every stop on the published route that the private carrier serves and shall provide real-time schedule information about any delays or alterations to published route on the website of the private carrier; b.    A private carrier shall operate a sufficient number of motorbuses on all routes in which the private carrier operates motorbus regular route service in order to accommodate every customer who pays a fare for use of the service; c.     A private carrier shall provide adequate notice and sufficient opportunity for feedback from its customers regarding any increase in fares or any discontinuation or diminishment of service; d.    An operator of a motorbus shall not allow a motorbus to become overcrowded with more passengers than the motorbus can safely accommodate; e.     A motorbus being used to provide motorbus regular route service shall be clean, well-maintained, and in good working condition at all times; f.     A private carrier shall make every effort to compensate or reimburse, through the refund of fare or a voucher for future provision of service, any customer who pays a fare to use that carriers service, but is forced to use other means of travel as a result of the customers inability to utilize the service because the motorbus was operating at capacity or an insufficient number of motorbuses were operating on the route; g.    A private carrier shall implement a toll-free telephone hotline which allows customers to submit complaints regarding service provided by the carrier.  The carrier shall respond to all complaints in a timely fashion and work to resolve any problems customers encounter regarding poor or inadequate service;

The customer bill of rights provides that private carriers are obligated to adhere to a published schedule, provide real-time information on the private carriers website when there are delays or alterations to the published schedule, operate a sufficient number of motorbuses to accommodate all customers, and provide adequate notice regarding any changes in fares or service.  The bill of rights prohibits operators from allowing motorbuses to become overcrowded and requires that motorbuses be clean, well-maintained, and in good working condition.  Private carriers are to make every effort to compensate customers who pay fares but do not use the carriers service because a motorbus was already operating at capacity or because of an insufficient number of motorbuses on the route.  Private carriers are to implement a toll-free telephone hotline by which customers may submit complaints.  Finally, the bill of rights provides that all operators are to be well-trained and familiar with the routes that the operators serve and are to refrain from engaging in unsafe behaviors while operating motorbus. This bill requires private carriers to provide customer complaint contact information so that customers may contact the Office of the Advocate for Private Commuter Bus Service Customers. The Attorney General or any other person may bring an action before the Superior Court to impose a civil penalty not exceeding $1,000 per violation for any violation of the provisions set forth in this bill.  The penalty is to take into consideration any compensation paid or offered by the private carrier to its customers.
