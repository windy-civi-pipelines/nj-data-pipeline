<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  The
Legislature hereby finds and declares that certain crimes are so reprehensible
and abhorrent that extreme measures must be taken against them, and that it is
not only murders that are suitable for such a designation.  Any person who
commits a depraved and violent sexual assault must be permanently removed from
contact with society.</p>

who has been convicted of aggravated sexual assault pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-2
where the victim suffered serious bodily injury as defined in subsection b. of
N.J.S.2C:11-1 shall be sentenced by the court to a term of life imprisonment,

application of the prosecutor, be sentenced to an extended term of
imprisonment.</p>

conviction of aggravated sexual assault, the extended term shall be for a
specific term of years which shall be between 30 years and life imprisonment. </p>

minimum sentence of not less than 5 years during which the defendant shall not

is considered a second or subsequent offense, if the actor has at any time been
convicted under sections 2C:14-2 or 2C:14-3a. or under any similar statute of
the United States, this state, or any other state for an offense that is

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In 1987, Lawrence Singleton's
parole from a California prison made national headlines; he had served eight
years of a fourteen-year sentence for the vicious rape and mutilation of a
15-year-old hitchhiker.  After the rape, Singleton had hacked off his victim's
arms with an ax and left her to die, but she survived to testify against him.
Despite the public outcry against Singleton's release, officials were powerless
to stop it, since he had served his sentence under the California law in effect
at the time.  In February, 1997, Singleton was arrested again, this time for
the murder of a woman in his home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is intended to
prevent brutal attackers such as Singleton from ever getting a second chance to
claim another victim. The bill would require that any person who commits a
violent sexual assault would be required to serve a life sentence, without
possibility for parole.  The life sentence would be imposed on any person
convicted of aggravated sexual assault upon a victim who suffers serious bodily
injury.  Under the Criminal Code, &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; is defined
as &quot;bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which
causes serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of
the function of any bodily member or organ.&quot; </p>
