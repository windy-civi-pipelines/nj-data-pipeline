(cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.10) 4.    Section 13 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.16) is amended to read as follows: 13.  a.  Controllers and processors shall meet their respective obligations established under P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) and P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    Processors shall adhere to the instructions of the controller and assist the controller to meet its obligations under this act. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, the processor shall assist the controller by: (1) taking appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, for the fulfillment of the controller's obligation to respond to consumer requests to exercise their rights under this act; (2) helping to meet the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to notification of a breach of the security of the system; and (3) providing information to the controller necessary to enable the controller to conduct and document any data protection assessments required by section 9 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.12). The controller and processor are each responsible for only the measures allocated to them. c.     Notwithstanding the instructions of the controller, a processor shall: (1) ensure that each person processing the personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data; and (2) engage a subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in accordance with subsection e. of this section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data. d.    Taking into account the context of processing, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk and establish a clear allocation of the responsibilities between them to implement the measures. e.     Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract between the controller and the processor that is binding on both parties and that sets forth: (1) the processing instructions to which the processor is bound, including the nature and purpose of the processing; (2) the type of personal data subject to the processing[,] and the duration of the processing; (3) the requirements imposed by this subsection and subsections c. and d. of this section; and (4) the following requirements: (a) At the discretion of the controller, the processor shall delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law; (b) (i) The processor shall make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations in this act; and (ii) The processor shall allow for, and contribute to, reasonable assessments and inspections by the controller or the controller's designated assessor. Alternatively, the processor may, with the controller's consent, arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct, at least annually and at the processor's expense, an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this act using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework for the assessment as applicable. The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller upon request. f.     In no event may a contract relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on them by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as defined by P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.). g.    Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data shall be a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data are to be processed. A person that is not limited in its processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or that fails to adhere to the instructions, shall be deemed a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data shall remain a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, it shall be deemed a controller with respect to the processing. (cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.13) 5.    Section 14 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.17) is amended to read as follows: 14.  a.  It shall be an unlawful practice and violation of P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.) for a controller or processor to violate the provisions of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) and P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    Until the first day of the 18th month next following the effective date of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.), prior to bringing an enforcement action before an administrative law judge or a court of competent jurisdiction in this State, the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety shall issue a notice to the controller or processor if a cure is deemed possible. If the [operator] controller or processor fails to cure the alleged violation of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) within 30 days after receiving notice of alleged noncompliance from the division, such enforcement action may be brought. (cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.14) 6.    Section 15 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.18) is amended to read as follows: 15.  The Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety shall promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act,"  P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), necessary to effectuate the purposes of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) and P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The director shall promulgate rules and regulations that provide for standards for the de-identification of personal data pursuant to section 8 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The director may include in the rules and regulations one or more limited exceptions to the provisions of subsections a. and b. of section 8 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), provided that: a.     the director expects any exception to benefit the public; and b.    any exception is limited to the purpose of medical studies or the purpose of preventing or alleviating environmental hazards. (cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.15) 7.    Section 16 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.19) is amended to read as follows: 16.  The Office of the Attorney General shall have sole and exclusive authority to enforce a violation of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) and P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Nothing in P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) or P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be construed as providing the basis for, or subject to, a private right of action for violations of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.16) 8.    (New section)  a.  A controller or processor shall de-identify personal data prior to the sale of the personal data. b.    A controller or processor shall not: (1)   re-identify de-identified data before or after the sale of personal data that has been previously de-identified; (2)   provide a third party the means to re-identify personal data after the sale of de-identified data to the third party; or (3)   engage a third party to re-identify de-identified data before or after the sale of the de-identified data. c.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this section to the contrary, a controller or processor shall not be found to violate this section if an exception, established by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs pursuant to section 15 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.18), applies. 9.    This act shall take effect on the 365th day following the date of enactment, except that the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill amends current law on the sale or processing of personal data to provide that a controller or processor of personal data is required to de-identify personal data before sale.  The bill also prohibits a controller or processor from (1) re-identifying de-identified data before or after the sale of personal data that has been previously de-identified; (2) providing a third party the means to re-identify personal data after the sale of de-identified data to the third party; or (3) engaging a third party to re-identify de-identified data before or after the sale of the de-identified data.  Pursuant to the bill, re-identify means to link de-identified data to an identified or identifiable individual, or a device linked to such an individual. The bill requires the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs (director) in the Department of Law and Public Safety to establish standards for the de-identification of personal data.  The bill also permits the director to allow exceptions to the requirements of de-identification or prohibitions on re-identification, provided that: (1) the director expects any exception to benefit the public; and (2) any exception is limited to the purpose of medical studies or the purpose of preventing or alleviating environmental hazards.

(cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.10) 4.    Section 13 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.16) is amended to read as follows: 13.  a.  Controllers and processors shall meet their respective obligations established under P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) and P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    Processors shall adhere to the instructions of the controller and assist the controller to meet its obligations under this act. Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, the processor shall assist the controller by: (1) taking appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as possible, for the fulfillment of the controller's obligation to respond to consumer requests to exercise their rights under this act; (2) helping to meet the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to notification of a breach of the security of the system; and (3) providing information to the controller necessary to enable the controller to conduct and document any data protection assessments required by section 9 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.12). The controller and processor are each responsible for only the measures allocated to them. c.     Notwithstanding the instructions of the controller, a processor shall: (1) ensure that each person processing the personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data; and (2) engage a subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in accordance with subsection e. of this section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data. d.    Taking into account the context of processing, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk and establish a clear allocation of the responsibilities between them to implement the measures. e.     Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract between the controller and the processor that is binding on both parties and that sets forth: (1) the processing instructions to which the processor is bound, including the nature and purpose of the processing; (2) the type of personal data subject to the processing[,] and the duration of the processing; (3) the requirements imposed by this subsection and subsections c. and d. of this section; and (4) the following requirements: (a) At the discretion of the controller, the processor shall delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law; (b) (i) The processor shall make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations in this act; and (ii) The processor shall allow for, and contribute to, reasonable assessments and inspections by the controller or the controller's designated assessor. Alternatively, the processor may, with the controller's consent, arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct, at least annually and at the processor's expense, an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this act using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework for the assessment as applicable. The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller upon request. f.     In no event may a contract relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on them by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as defined by P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.). g.    Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data shall be a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data are to be processed. A person that is not limited in its processing of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or that fails to adhere to the instructions, shall be deemed a controller and not a processor with respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data shall remain a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, it shall be deemed a controller with respect to the processing. (cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.13) 5.    Section 14 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.17) is amended to read as follows: 14.  a.  It shall be an unlawful practice and violation of P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.) for a controller or processor to violate the provisions of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) and P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    Until the first day of the 18th month next following the effective date of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.), prior to bringing an enforcement action before an administrative law judge or a court of competent jurisdiction in this State, the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety shall issue a notice to the controller or processor if a cure is deemed possible. If the [operator] controller or processor fails to cure the alleged violation of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) within 30 days after receiving notice of alleged noncompliance from the division, such enforcement action may be brought. (cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.14) 6.    Section 15 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.18) is amended to read as follows: 15.  The Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety shall promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act,"  P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), necessary to effectuate the purposes of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) and P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The director shall promulgate rules and regulations that provide for standards for the de-identification of personal data pursuant to section 8 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The director may include in the rules and regulations one or more limited exceptions to the provisions of subsections a. and b. of section 8 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), provided that: a.     the director expects any exception to benefit the public; and b.    any exception is limited to the purpose of medical studies or the purpose of preventing or alleviating environmental hazards. (cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.15) 7.    Section 16 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.19) is amended to read as follows: 16.  The Office of the Attorney General shall have sole and exclusive authority to enforce a violation of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) and P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Nothing in P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.) or P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be construed as providing the basis for, or subject to, a private right of action for violations of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.4 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2023, c.266, s.16) 8.    (New section)  a.  A controller or processor shall de-identify personal data prior to the sale of the personal data. b.    A controller or processor shall not: (1)   re-identify de-identified data before or after the sale of personal data that has been previously de-identified; (2)   provide a third party the means to re-identify personal data after the sale of de-identified data to the third party; or (3)   engage a third party to re-identify de-identified data before or after the sale of the de-identified data. c.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this section to the contrary, a controller or processor shall not be found to violate this section if an exception, established by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs pursuant to section 15 of P.L.2023, c.266 (C.56:8-166.18), applies. 9.    This act shall take effect on the 365th day following the date of enactment, except that the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill amends current law on the sale or processing of personal data to provide that a controller or processor of personal data is required to de-identify personal data before sale.  The bill also prohibits a controller or processor from (1) re-identifying de-identified data before or after the sale of personal data that has been previously de-identified; (2) providing a third party the means to re-identify personal data after the sale of de-identified data to the third party; or (3) engaging a third party to re-identify de-identified data before or after the sale of the de-identified data.  Pursuant to the bill, re-identify means to link de-identified data to an identified or identifiable individual, or a device linked to such an individual. The bill requires the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs (director) in the Department of Law and Public Safety to establish standards for the de-identification of personal data.  The bill also permits the director to allow exceptions to the requirements of de-identification or prohibitions on re-identification, provided that: (1) the director expects any exception to benefit the public; and (2) any exception is limited to the purpose of medical studies or the purpose of preventing or alleviating environmental hazards.
