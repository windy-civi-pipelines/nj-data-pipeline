(cf: P.L.2013, c.166, s.6) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require that shared service agreements between local governments include certain provisions.  Specifically, and in addition to provisions required under current law, the bill requires such an agreement to include: (1) performance evaluation criteria; (2)  procedures for determining any fee adjustments; (3) alternative dispute resolution procedures; and (4) exit procedures to govern the dissolution of the agreement.  Requiring these items to be addressed at the outset will help avoid, and make easier to resolve, potential issues that may arise over the course of such an agreement.
