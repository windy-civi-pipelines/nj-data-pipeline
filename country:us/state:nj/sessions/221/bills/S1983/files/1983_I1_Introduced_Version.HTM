<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning advanced practice nurses, revising
various parts of the statutory law, and supplementing P.L.1991, c.377
(C.45:11-45 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Advanced practice
nurses are registered nurses who are certified to provide an advanced level of
health care to patients that exceeds the standard scope of nursing practice.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Advanced practice nurses
augment the system of care in New Jersey and nationwide by providing treatment
services at a level that can relieve some of the demand on physicians, of whom
there is a chronic shortage, and expedite access to care for patients,
including those in medically underserved areas and among medically underserved
populations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Studies suggest that
approximately one quarter of the population of the United States lives in an
area with a shortage of primary care professionals.  Limited access to care is
frequently worse among racial and ethnic minorities, people with low incomes,
and individuals for whom a lack of transportation creates logistical barriers
to health care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    One way to reduce gaps
in health care access is to allow full practice authority for advanced practice
nurses, over 75 percent of whom are educated in a primary care specialty and
can directly improve access to both primary care services and specialty care
services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Currently, 24 states,
the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories have adopted full practice
authority for advanced practice nurses.  The requirement to practice in
collaboration with a physician limits the ability of advanced practice nurses
to provide primary care and specialty care services, and has been associated
with advanced practice nurses leaving New Jersey for other jurisdictions with
fewer practice restrictions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     It has been estimated
that removing practice restrictions for advanced practice nurses has the
potential to reduce health care access disparities by a factor of more than 38
percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    In response to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Governor Murphy issued Executive
Order No. 112, which, among other things, directly and through waivers issued
pursuant to its authority, waived existing practice restrictions for advanced
practice nurses, including joint protocol and supervision requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    According to surveys,
over 45 percent of advanced practice nurses in New Jersey reported working
without practice restrictions as authorized under Executive Order No. 112 and
the waivers issued pursuant to the executive order.  No adverse incidents were
reported during the waiver period involving advanced practice nurses practicing
without practice restrictions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Given the need for
expanded access to care, it is necessary and appropriate to take steps to
remove practice restrictions that serve as a barrier for advanced practice
nurses to practice in New Jersey to the full extent of their education,
clinical training, and national certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 1 of P.L.1947,
c.262 (C.45:11-23) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The words &quot;the
board&quot; mean the New Jersey Board of Nursing created by this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The practice of nursing
as a registered professional nurse is defined as diagnosing and treating human
responses to actual or potential physical and emotional health problems,
through such services as casefinding, health teaching, health counseling, and provision
of care supportive to or restorative of life and well-being, and executing
medical regimens as prescribed by a licensed or otherwise legally authorized
physician or dentist. Diagnosing in the context of nursing practice means the
identification of and discrimination between physical and psychosocial signs
and symptoms essential to effective execution and management of the nursing
regimen within the scope of practice of the registered professional nurse. 
Such diagnostic privilege is distinct from a medical diagnosis.  Treating means
selection and performance of those therapeutic measures essential to the
effective management and execution of the nursing regimen.  Human responses
means those signs, symptoms, and processes which denote the individual's health
need or reaction to an actual or potential health problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The practice of nursing as a
licensed practical nurse is defined as performing tasks and responsibilities
within the framework of casefinding; reinforcing the patient and family
teaching program through health teaching, health counseling and provision of
supportive and restorative care, under the direction of a registered nurse or
licensed or otherwise legally authorized physician or dentist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The terms &quot;nursing,&quot;
&quot;professional nursing,&quot; and &quot;practical nursing&quot; as used in
this act shall not be construed to include nursing by students enrolled in a
school of nursing accredited or approved by the board performed in the
prescribed course of study and training, nor nursing performed in hospitals,
