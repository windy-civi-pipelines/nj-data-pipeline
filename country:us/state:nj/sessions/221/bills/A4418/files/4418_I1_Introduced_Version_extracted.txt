A Supplement to the annual appropriations act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, P.L.2023, c.74. Be It Enacted by the Senate and the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  In addition to the amounts appropriated under P.L.2023, c.74, the annual appropriations act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, there are appropriated from the General Fund the following amount for the purpose specified: 10 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 40 Community Development and Environmental Management 49 Agricultural Resources, Planning, and Regulation DIRECT STATE SERVICES 06-3360 Marketing and Development Services $500,000 Direct State Services: 06 Jersey Fresh Program ($500,000) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill supplements the Fiscal Year 2024 appropriations act to make an additional appropriation of $500,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Agriculture to increase funding to the Jersey Fresh program.  Jersey Fresh is an advertising and marketing program that helps farmers inform consumers about the availability of locally grown produce.  The program began in 1984 as a $50,000 campaign before accruing appropriations of over $1 million per year; funding has since been limited to $100,000 as the campaign approaches its 40th anniversary.  Under the fiscal year 2024 appropriations act, Jersey Fresh programs received $100,000 for the purpose of marketing and promoting locally grown produce.  This bill increases the funding for FY 2025 by $500,000. The sponsor intends this appropriation to replace the use of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Specialty Crops Block Grant for the Jersey Fresh program.  As a result of the supplemental appropriation, the amount of federal money available to farmers and organizations from this needed federal grant program will be increased, as up to 50 percent of the federal grant funds are used to fund the Jersey Fresh program. This bill would rebalance the funding of the Jersey Fresh program and the amount available for USDA Specialty Crop Block Grant awards so that both benefit the States farmers to the fullest.
