It shall be a violation of P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), subject to all remedies and penalties available pursuant to P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), in addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by law, for a veterinarian to intentionally misrepresent, including through the use of euphemisms, code words, or otherwise, the information required to be provided pursuant to this subsection.  It shall be assumed that a veterinarian who intentionally misrepresents information pursuant to this subsection is not acting within the veterinary scope of practice. c.     Upon receiving the notification required in subsection b. of this section, the owner of the animal shall immediately provide, in writing, in the manner prescribed by the department pursuant to subsection d. of this section: (1) release of the animal to the health official or veterinarian, as applicable, for the rabies testing, in accordance with the protocols to be followed pursuant to subsection b. of this section; and (2) the owner's signature to acknowledge notification about the protocols and procedures to be followed pursuant to this section. d.    The Department of Health shall develop and provide on its website forms for use in providing the notification required pursuant to subsection b. of this section, and the release, and acknowledgement of notification required pursuant to subsection c. of this section. e.     This section shall not apply to rabies testing required pursuant to section 10 of P.L.1989, c.307 (C.4:19-26) or to the handling of an impounded animal that is suspected of being rabid pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.16).  In cases where a veterinarian or health official has made reasonable attempts to contact the owner to comply with this section and the owner is unable to be contacted or refuses to provide a signature, rabies testing can proceed.  When contact is made but a written signature or acknowledgement by the owner cannot be obtained, the veterinarian or health official shall document the date and time that verbal or electronic notification was made to the owner and keep this information on file for [six months] three years. f.     Nothing in this section shall be construed to interfere with the powers of any municipality to control rabies consistent with R.S.26:4-95. g.    As used in this section, "domestic companion animal" means any animal commonly referred to as a pet that was bought, bred, raised, or otherwise acquired, in accordance with local ordinances and State and federal law, for the primary purpose of providing companionship to the owner, rather than for business or agricultural purposes.

STATEMENT The bill provides that it is a violation of the consumer fraud act for a veterinarian to intentionally misrepresent, including through the use of euphemisms, code words, or otherwise, the information required under current law to be provided to the owner of a dead domestic companion animal undergoing testing for rabies.  An unlawful practice is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense.  In addition, a violation can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured party. In addition, the bill requires the Division of Consumer Affairs to develop a poster and pamphlet with information relating to rabies vaccines and quarantine and testing protocols. Veterinarians are required to display the poster in office reception areas and to distribute the pamphlets to certain customers.
