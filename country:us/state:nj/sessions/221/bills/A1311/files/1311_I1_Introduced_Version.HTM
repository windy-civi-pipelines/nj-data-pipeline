P.L.   , c.    (C.       ) (now pending before the Legislature as this bill)</u>. 
The board shall provide the commissioner with an informational filing of the
policy and contract forms and benefit levels it establishes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The individual health
benefits plans established by the board may include cost containment measures
such as, but not limited to: utilization review of health care services,
including review of medical necessity of hospital and physician services; case
management benefit alternatives; selective contracting with hospitals,
physicians, and other health care providers; and reasonable benefit
differentials applicable to participating and nonparticipating providers; and
other managed care provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    An individual health
benefits plan offered pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1992, c.161 (C.17B:27A-4)
shall contain a limitation of no more than 12 months on coverage for
preexisting conditions.  An individual health benefits plan offered pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.1992, c.161 (C.17B:27A-4) shall not contain a preexisting
condition limitation of any period under the following circumstances:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) to an individual who has,
under creditable coverage, with no intervening lapse in coverage of more than
31 days, been treated or diagnosed by a physician for a condition under that
plan or satisfied a 12-month preexisting condition limitation; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) to a federally defined
eligible individual who applies for an individual health benefits plan within
63 days of termination of the prior coverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In addition to the five
standard individual health benefits plans provided for in section 3 of
P.L.1992, c.161 (C.17B:27A-4), the board may develop up to five rider
packages.  Premium rates for the rider packages shall be determined in accordance
with section 8 of P.L.1992, c.161 (C.17B:27A-9).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    After the board's
establishment of the individual health benefits plans required pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.1992, c.161 (C.17B:27A-4), and notwithstanding any law to the
contrary, a carrier shall file the policy or contract forms with the board and
certify to the board that the health benefits plans to be used by the carrier
are in substantial compliance with the provisions in the corresponding board
approved plans.  The certification shall be signed by the chief executive
officer of the carrier.  Upon receipt by the board of the certification, the
certified plans may be used until the board, after notice and hearing,
disapproves their continued use.</p>

anniversary date of an individual health benefits plan in effect on the
effective date of P.L.1995, c.316 (C.17:48E-35.10 et al.), the individual
health benefits plans required pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1992, c.161
(C.17B:27A-4), including any plan offered by a federally qualified health
maintenance organization, shall contain benefits for expenses incurred in the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  Screening by blood lead
measurement for lead poisoning for children, including confirmatory blood lead

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill allows gross income
tax advantages in connection with Health Savings Accounts in conformity with
the federal income tax advantages extended to these accounts under recent
federal law.  The bill provides a gross income tax deduction for deposits to,
and an exemption for withdrawals from, health savings accounts. Individuals can
use these accounts to cover out-of-pocket medical care costs under
high-deductible medical care plans.  The bill also excludes the earnings in an
account from gross income taxation, as the account earnings are excluded from
federal income taxation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The federal Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 permits eligible
individuals to establish health savings accounts (HSAs) for taxable years beginning
on or after January 1, 2004.  Under the federal income tax, HSA contributions
are deductible from adjusted gross income, contributions grow tax-free over the
years, and amounts can be distributed tax-free to pay or reimburse qualified
medical expenses. HSAs are similar to Archer medical savings accounts (MSAs)
established as tax-advantaged accounts under the federal income tax and
accorded similar tax-free treatment under the New Jersey gross income tax. 
However, HSAs are more flexible and available to many more individuals than
MSAs. Taxpayers can be expected to embrace them enthusiastically because the
federal tax benefits are generous; HSAs are akin to tax-favored accounts like
IRAs or 401(k)s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Eligible individuals are
individuals who are covered by a high-deductible health plan.  A
high-deductible health plan is a health plan that has a deductible that is at
least $1,000 for self-only coverage or $2,000 for family coverage.  The policy
must also have an out-of-pocket maximum that can be no greater than $5,000 for
self-only coverage and $10,000 for family coverage.  Out-of-pocket expense
includes deductibles, copayments, and other amounts (other than premiums) that
the individual must pay for covered benefits under their medical care plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes contributions
made by or on behalf of an eligible individual that are deductible for federal
income tax purposes deductible by the individual for gross income tax
purposes.  Also, the bill makes employer contributions to an HSA excludible
from gross income to the extent the contribution would be deductible if made by
the employee.  The maximum aggregate annual contribution that can be made to an
HSA, as set by federal law, is the lesser of 100 percent of the annual
deductible under the high-deductible health plan, or the maximum deductible
permitted under an MSA as adjusted for inflation.  Contributions can be made to
individual HSAs by individual and their employers.  For 2018, the amount of the
maximum high deductible is estimated to be $6,650 in the case of self-only
coverage and $13,300 in the case of family coverage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the gross income tax as
under the federal income tax, tax-free rollover contributions from Archer MSAs
and other HSAs into an HSA will be permitted. Rollovers will not be subject to
the annual contribution limits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, distributions
from an HSA for qualified medical expense (most medical expenses defined as
deductible for federal income tax purposes) for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's
spouse, and dependents generally will be excludable from New Jersey gross
income.  Distributions from an HSA that are not for qualified medical expenses
will be includable in New Jersey gross income. However, distributions that are
not for qualified medical expenses will not be includable in gross income if
they are made after death or disability, or after the individual attains the
age of Medicare eligibility (age 65).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     HSAs give workers the
opportunity to save tax-free for routine medical bills like doctor visits or
medicines, the security of funds to cover the out-of-pocket expenses of a major
illness, and the freedom of knowing that the account is worker-owned, not under
the control of an insurance company, and is portable whenever a worker changes
employers.  During years when an individual's family health care spending is
low, the money remaining in the HSA earns tax-free interest, dividends or gains
and is available in the future when unexpected medical expenses arise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Health savings accounts are a
new option which will give families access to affordable health care will
reducing health insurance premiums.  The tax advantages provided under federal
law are not available under the current New Jersey gross income tax.  This bill
will extend that tax conformity. </p>
