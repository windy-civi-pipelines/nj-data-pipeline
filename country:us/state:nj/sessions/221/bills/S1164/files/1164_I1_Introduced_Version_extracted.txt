Federally chartered credit unions enjoy an exemption from state sales taxes and most other state taxes pursuant to the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. s.1768).  The sales and use tax imposed on State-chartered credit unions creates a competitive disadvantage compared to their federal counterparts.  The exemption establishes sales tax parity between State and federally chartered credit unions. The exemption in the bill expires if federally chartered credit unions lose their current exemption from state sales taxes.  Additionally, the exemption does not apply if the credit union is a purchaser or user of tangible personal property for the purpose of being a lessor.
