The bill provides that the Commissioner of Human Services, based upon clinical evidence and the recommendations of experts in the fields of obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine, will determine the remote services to be provided through the pilot program.  At minimum, the program will provide remote patient monitoring, remote non-stress tests, and tele-ultrasound services for pregnant Medicaid beneficiaries.  The bill defines remote maternal health services as the use of digital technology to collect medical and health data from a pregnant patient and securely transmit this information to a health care provider at a distant site for interpretation and use as part of a diagnosis or a treatment plan.  Remote patient monitoring is defined as the use of digital technology to collect and transmit patient health data to a healthcare provider at a distant site for review and treatment management.

The bill provides that State licensed physicians, certified nurse midwives, professional midwives, or midwives may refer a pregnant Medicaid beneficiary to the pilot program if the health care provider determines that remote maternal health services are in the beneficiarys best interests; or that the beneficiary has an increased likelihood of a high-risk pregnancy due to: pre-existing medical conditions; age; lifestyle factors; or a diagnosed pregnancy-related condition, such as preeclampsia. The bill also provides that remote maternal health services will be available to a pregnant Medicaid beneficiary whose pregnancy is not high-risk, but who resides in a community that lacks a sufficient number of health care providers who offer obstetric care and participate in the Medicaid program.  Eligibility for the pilot program will also be extended to a pregnant Medicaid beneficiary who is unable to access consistent obstetric care due to socioeconomic factors, such as the beneficiarys work schedule, a lack of reliable transportation, or a lack of reliable child care. Pursuant to the bill, the establishment of the remote maternal health services pilot program is contingent upon federal approval of the States Medicaid waiver application or State plan amendment, in order to ensure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program.
