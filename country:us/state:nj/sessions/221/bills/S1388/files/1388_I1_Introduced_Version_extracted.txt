"Supplemental limited benefit insurance" means insurance that is provided in addition to a health benefits plan on an indemnity non-expense incurred basis. (cf: P.L.2009, c.293, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill resolves an apparent conflict between provisions in chapter 10 of Title 40A of the New Jersey Statutes, which permit municipalities to offer group health insurance benefits to volunteer fire fighters and emergency responders, and provisions in chapter 27A of Title 17B of the New Jersey Statutes regarding small employer health benefits plans.  For example, although N.J.S.40A:10-30 authorizes a municipality to provide group health plans to volunteer firefighters, those volunteers are not considered eligible employees under the small employer health benefits plan statutes.  This bill clarifies that these volunteers, as well as emergency responders, may be included in the group of eligible employees in municipalities regarded as small employers, and thereby receive coverage under the same group plan.

"Supplemental limited benefit insurance" means insurance that is provided in addition to a health benefits plan on an indemnity non-expense incurred basis. (cf: P.L.2009, c.293, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill resolves an apparent conflict between provisions in chapter 10 of Title 40A of the New Jersey Statutes, which permit municipalities to offer group health insurance benefits to volunteer fire fighters and emergency responders, and provisions in chapter 27A of Title 17B of the New Jersey Statutes regarding small employer health benefits plans.  For example, although N.J.S.40A:10-30 authorizes a municipality to provide group health plans to volunteer firefighters, those volunteers are not considered eligible employees under the small employer health benefits plan statutes.  This bill clarifies that these volunteers, as well as emergency responders, may be included in the group of eligible employees in municipalities regarded as small employers, and thereby receive coverage under the same group plan.
