<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1999,
c.154 (C.17:48-8.4) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  Within 180 days of the
adoption of a timetable for implementation pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999,
c.154 (C.17B:30-23), a hospital service corporation or its agent or a subsidiary
that processes health care benefits claims as a third party administrator,
shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Banking and
Insurance that it will adopt and implement all of the standards to receive and
transmit health care transactions electronically, according to the
corresponding timetable, and otherwise comply with the provisions of this
section, as a condition of its continued authorization to do business in this
State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Commissioner of Banking
and Insurance may grant extensions or waivers of the implementation requirement
when it has been demonstrated to the commissioner's satisfaction that
compliance with the timetable for implementation will result in an undue
hardship to a hospital service corporation, or its agent, its subsidiary or its
covered persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Within 12 months of the
adoption of regulations establishing standard health care enrollment and claim
forms by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance pursuant to section 1 of
P.L.1999, c.154 (C.17B:30-23), a hospital service corporation or its agent or a
subsidiary that processes health care benefits claims as a third party
administrator shall use the standard health care enrollment and claim forms in
connection with all group and individual contracts issued, delivered, executed

adoption of regulations establishing standard health care enrollment and claim
forms by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance pursuant to section 1 of
P.L.1999, c.154 (C.17B:30-23), a hospital service corporation or its agent
shall require that health care providers file all claims for payment for health
care services.  A covered person who receives health care services shall not be
required to submit a claim for payment, but notwithstanding the provisions of
this subsection to the contrary, a covered person shall be permitted to submit
a claim on his own behalf, at the covered person's option.  All claims shall be
filed using the standard health care claim form applicable to the contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    For the purposes of this
subsection, &quot;substantiating documentation&quot; means any information
specific to the particular health care service provided to a covered person.</p>

the effective date of P.L.1999, c.154, a hospital service corporation or its
agent, hereinafter the payer, shall remit payment for every insured claim
submitted by a covered person or health care provider, no later than the 30th
calendar day following receipt of the claim by the payer or no later than the
time limit established for the payment of claims in the Medicare program
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s.1395u(c)(2)(B), whichever is earlier, if the claim is

service or supply covered under the health benefits plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   the claim is submitted
with all the information requested by the payer on the claim form or in other
instructions that were distributed in advance to the health care provider or
covered person in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of P.L.2023,
c.296 (C.17B:30-55.4); and</p>

incorrect information with a statement as to what information must be corrected
for adjudication of the claim;</p>

dispute; or</p>
