purposes but for the fact that such taxpayer is a nonresident alien, shall determine tax pursuant to subsection a. of this section. (cf: P.L.2004, c.40, s.17) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. STATEMENT The bill reduces gross income tax rates by ten percent over three taxable years.  The purpose of this bill is to lower the gross income tax liabilities of all New Jersey gross income taxpayers while tempering the steep progressivity of the gross income tax liability structure. The bill schedules the gross income tax rate reductions to occur at three and one-third percent for taxable years beginning in 2013, an additional three and one-third percent for taxable years beginning in 2014, and an additional three and one-third percent for taxable years beginning in 2015.  After 2015, the bill maintains the total ten percent gross income tax rate reduction for future taxable years.

purposes but for the fact that such taxpayer is a nonresident alien, shall determine tax pursuant to subsection a. of this section. (cf: P.L.2004, c.40, s.17) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2013. STATEMENT The bill reduces gross income tax rates by ten percent over three taxable years.  The purpose of this bill is to lower the gross income tax liabilities of all New Jersey gross income taxpayers while tempering the steep progressivity of the gross income tax liability structure. The bill schedules the gross income tax rate reductions to occur at three and one-third percent for taxable years beginning in 2013, an additional three and one-third percent for taxable years beginning in 2014, and an additional three and one-third percent for taxable years beginning in 2015.  After 2015, the bill maintains the total ten percent gross income tax rate reduction for future taxable years.
