The bill requires the Division of Pensions and Benefits to send a first notice to the member or the members designated beneficiary stating the details of the final compensation that will be utilized in calculating the members retirement benefits upon receiving a properly completed retirement application from the member of TPAF or PERS.  Under current law, final compensation is calculated using the members ultimate three years of creditable service in New Jersey immediately preceding the member's retirement or death, or the average annual compensation for New Jersey service for which contributions are made during any three fiscal years of the members membership providing the largest possible benefit to the member or the member's beneficiary.
