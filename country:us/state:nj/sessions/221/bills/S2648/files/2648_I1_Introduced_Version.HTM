STATEMENT This bill concerns the provision of services to defendants on pretrial release. While current law provides a variety of services for individuals upon reentering society following their release from incarceration, there are limited supports and services offered to defendants in this State who are charged with certain crimes and who are ordered to be released pending a final resolution of their matter. This bill authorizes counties to appoint a county pretrial release coordinator to evaluate the needs of defendants in the county for whom a complaint-warrant has been issued for an initial charge involving an indictable offense or a disorderly persons offense, and pretrial release has been ordered. The  pretrial release coordinator is required to advise each eligible defendant that the services are offered on a voluntary basis and that the defendant is not required to receive the services offered. The pretrial release coordinator is responsible for offering the following assistance to the defendants in accessing services deemed necessary pursuant to the evaluation: · scheduling and otherwise accessing appropriate treatment, services, and programming during the defendants period of pretrial release; · providing information concerning, and assistance in completing, applications for appropriate State and county public assistance program benefits; · providing information concerning available substance use disorder treatment and services including, but not limited to, medication-assisted treatment; · providing information concerning relevant social services and rehabilitative programs; · providing information concerning services provided by the State's One-Stop Career Centers; · providing information concerning insurance eligibility; · providing information concerning any other treatment, services, and programming deemed appropriate based on the evaluation required pursuant to the bill; and · if appropriate, providing assistance with obtaining a non-driver identification card. In addition, the county pretrial release coordinator is required to consult and coordinate with the county board of social services or welfare agency, as appropriate, when providing information or assistance with respect to a benefit or service administered by the board or welfare agency. The coordinator is required to collect and analyze data related to the services provided; develop peer counseling programs; meet with community stakeholders to establish best practices in providing services to defendants on pretrial release; identify available county services; and make recommendations for the provision of services to defendants during pretrial release.  The amounts deemed necessary to support the county pretrial release coordinators are to be annually appropriated. This bill would implement recommendation number 15 of the report of the reconvened Joint Committee on Criminal Justice issued in June 2023.
