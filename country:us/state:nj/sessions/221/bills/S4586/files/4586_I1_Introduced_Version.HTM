<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    N.J.S.2C:44-1 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2C:44-1. a. In determining the
appropriate sentence to be imposed on a person who has been convicted of an
offense, the court shall consider the following aggravating circumstances:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) The nature and
circumstances of the offense, and the role of the actor in committing the
offense, including whether or not it was committed in an especially heinous,
cruel, or depraved manner;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) The gravity and seriousness
of harm inflicted on the victim, including whether or not the defendant knew or
reasonably should have known that the victim of the offense was particularly
vulnerable or incapable of resistance due to advanced age, ill-health, or
extreme youth, or was for any other reason substantially incapable of
exercising normal physical or mental power of resistance;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) The risk that the
defendant will commit another offense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) A lesser sentence will
depreciate the seriousness of the defendant's offense because it involved a
breach of the public trust under chapters 27 and 30 of this title, or the
defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence to commit the
offense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) There is a substantial
likelihood that the defendant is involved in organized criminal activity; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) The extent of the
defendant's prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses of which
the defendant has been convicted; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7) The defendant committed
the offense pursuant to an agreement to either pay or be paid for the
commission of the offense and the pecuniary incentive was beyond that inherent
in the offense itself;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8) The defendant committed
the offense against a police or other law enforcement officer, correctional
employee or firefighter, acting in the performance of the officer, employee, or
firefighter duties while in uniform or exhibiting evidence of his authority;
the defendant committed the offense because of the status of the victim as a
public servant; the defendant committed the offense against a sports official,
athletic coach or manager, acting in or immediately following the performance
of the person's duties or because of the person's status as a sports official,
coach or manager; or the defendant committed the offense against any health
care professional, volunteer working for a health care professional or working
at a health care facility, supportive services staff member working for a
health care professional or working at a health care facility, or employee of a
health care professional or health care facility, while the health care
professional, volunteer, supportive services staff member, or employee is
performing official duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
paragraph, &quot;health care facility&quot; and &quot;health care
professional&quot; mean the same as those terms are defined in subsection b. of
section 3 of P.L.2023, c.48 (C.2C:12-3.1);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9) The need for deterring the
defendant and others from violating the law;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10) The offense involved
fraudulent or deceptive practices committed against any department or division
of State government; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11) The imposition of a fine,
penalty, or order of restitution without also imposing a term of imprisonment
would be perceived by the defendant or others merely as part of the cost of
doing business, or as an acceptable contingent business or operating expense
associated with the initial decision to resort to unlawful practices; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (12) The defendant committed
the offense against a person who the defendant knew or should have known was 60
years of age or older, or disabled; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (13) The defendant, while in
the course of committing or attempting to commit the crime, including the
immediate flight therefrom, used or was in possession of a stolen motor
vehicle; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (14) The offense involved an
act of domestic violence, as that term is defined in subsection a. of section 3
of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19), committed in the presence of a child under 16
years of age; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (15) The offense involved an
act of domestic violence, as that term is defined in subsection a. of section 3

degree, a term of six months;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) for a crime of the third
degree, a term of up to one year but not more than three years;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) for a crime of the second
degree, a term of up to three years but not more than five years;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) for a crime of the first

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u><span style='text-decoration:

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'><u>Resentencing</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows persons currently
incarcerated and serving a sentence of a minimum term of eight years or more
for an offense committed prior to the effective date of this act to apply for
resentencing pursuant to the new sentencing range.  Procedures are established
for applying for resentencing, requesting the assistance of appointed counsel
through the Office of the Public Defender, and notifying the prosecutor of a
defendants application.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
application for resentencing must include corroborating evidence that the
defendant was, at the time of the offense, a victim of domestic violence.  If
the court finds that the applicant has provided the required corroborating
evidence, the court is directed to conduct a hearing to aid in the resentencing
determination.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a person may
appeal an order denying resentencing, or a new sentence imposed on the grounds
that the term of the new sentence is excessive, or that the term of the new
sentence is unauthorized as a matter of law.  The applicant may request that
the court assign the applicant an attorney for the preparation of and
proceedings related to any appeals regarding the application for resentencing.
The attorney is to be assigned in accordance with the provisions of P.L.1967,
c. 43 (C. 2A:158A-1 et seq.). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'><u>Trauma-informed
reentry survivor support services</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that an
individual sentenced, resentenced, or released under the provisions of the bill
is eligible for trauma-informed reentry support services which shall include
access to mental health counseling, peer recovery support, vocational training,
and housing assistance.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Department of Corrections,
in collaboration with the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Office of
the Public Defender is directed to develop and disseminate implementation
guidelines for community-based reentry programs that serve individuals sentenced,
released, or resentenced under the bill.  The Department of Corrections is
directed to establish a grant program to assist community-based reentry
programs in providing mental health service providers and expanding the
pipeline of trained mental health service providers.  Community-based mental
health service provider is defined under the bill to mean a State-licensed or
State-certified counselor, psychologist, social worker, or other State-licensed
or State-certified mental health professional qualified under State law to
provide mental health services to trauma-involved reentry survivors.  In
addition to providing sentencing relief, the bill recognizes the critical need
for trauma-informed service centered justice through the provision of wraparound
reentry services delivered by justice-impacted, trained individuals.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is based, in part,
on the New York law known as the Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act, signed
into law on May 14, 2019, and Proposed Sentencing Reform B of the New Jersey Criminal
Sentencing and Disposition Commission Report, issued in March 2023.</p>
