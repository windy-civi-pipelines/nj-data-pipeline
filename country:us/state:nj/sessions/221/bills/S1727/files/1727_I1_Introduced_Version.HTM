No person who has been convicted of a crime, arising out of fraud or misrepresentation in the sale, leasing or financing of a motor vehicle, shall be eligible to receive a license.  For the purposes of this section, each applicant for a license shall submit to the chief administrator the applicant's name, address, fingerprints, and written consent for a criminal history record background check to be performed.  The chief administrator is hereby authorized to exchange fingerprint data with and receive criminal history record information from the State Bureau of Identification in the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation consistent with applicable State and federal laws, rules, and regulations, for purposes of facilitating determinations concerning licensure eligibility.  The applicant shall bear the cost for the criminal history record background check, including all costs of administering and processing the check.  The Division of State Police shall promptly notify the chief administrator in the event a current holder of a license or prospective applicant, who was the subject of a criminal history record background check pursuant to this section, is arrested for a crime or offense in this State after the date the background check was performed. Each applicant for a license shall at the time such license is issued have established and maintained, or by that application shall agree to establish and maintain, within 90 days after the issuance thereof, a place of business consisting of a permanent building not less than 1,000 square feet in floor space located in the State of New Jersey to be used principally for the servicing and display of motor vehicles with such equipment installed therein as shall be requisite for the servicing of motor vehicles in such manner as to make them comply with the laws of this State and with any rules and regulations made by the board governing the equipment, use, and operation of motor vehicles within the State.

STATEMENT This bill provides for the licensure of used motor vehicle dealers and establishes an eight-member State Board of Used Motor Vehicle Dealers in the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety to oversee their licensure. The board is to consist of three licensed used motor vehicle dealers, one licensed used motor vehicle dealer employed by a used motor vehicle dealer auction company, three public members, and a State executive department member. The bill provides for three types of licensure: retail used motor vehicle dealer, wholesale used motor vehicle dealer, and retail-wholesale used motor vehicle dealer.  To be eligible for licensure as a used motor vehicle dealer, an applicant is required to be at least 18 years old, be of good moral character, and fulfill the following requirements: (1)   hold a valid New Jersey drivers license demonstrating proof of residency or be an officer of a publicly traded or privately held company with a minimum of 500 domestic employees and hold a valid drivers license in the jurisdiction of the companys corporate headquarters; (2)   have an established place of business; and (3)   undergo a criminal history record background check. Under the bill, an established place of business includes a trailer, if the trailer is connected to utilities and remains in the same location for at least six months of the year. Further, under the bill, an applicant is not eligible to be licensed as a used motor vehicle dealer if the applicant has been convicted of an offense involving dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, or of a crime of the first or second degree. The bill provides that no person may engage in business as a used motor vehicle dealer in this State unless that person holds a valid license or the transaction involves an in-State purchaser, who is a used motor vehicle dealer licensed under the provisions of the bill, and a person who holds a valid used motor vehicle dealer license issued by another state. As defined in the bill, "used motor vehicle means every motor vehicle and motorized bicycle, except a nonconventional type motor vehicle, for which title to, or possession of, has been transferred from the person who first acquired it from the manufacturer or dealer, and so used as to become what is commonly known as "secondhand" within the ordinary meaning of that term, and includes every motor vehicle and motorized bicycle other than a new motor vehicle, a nonconventional type motor vehicle, or a manufactured home subject to real property taxation. The bill also makes changes to several statutes relating to the licensure of motor vehicle dealers by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC), currently the regulatory authority that licenses used motor vehicle dealers in the State.  In amending these statutes, the bill clarifies that the MVC will no longer license used motor vehicle dealers on or after the bills date of enactment.

F.    In addition to the fees elsewhere in this section provided for, there shall be paid to the [director] chief administrator at the time a certificate of ownership is issued a fee of $10 for notice of satisfaction of the lien or encumbrance of the record or abstract, or of the termination of the security interest, where the motor vehicle is subject to a lien or encumbrance or a security interest as provided in R.S.39:10-14. G.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, when any dealer licensed under the provisions of R.S.39:10-19 or P.L.    , c.  (C.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) is the purchaser of a motor vehicle in this State, he may, within 10 working days after its purchase, submit to the [director] chief administrator the evidence of purchase.  Upon presentation of the certificate of ownership with proper assignment and certification of the seller to the [director] chief administrator, a record of the transaction shall be made and filed. A certificate of ownership shall be issued by the [director] chief administrator and delivered to such purchaser, and the [director] chief administrator shall collect a fee of $10 for the issuing and filing thereof. If a dealer does not submit the evidence of purchase, upon resale of the motor vehicle he shall execute and attach to the certificate of ownership a dealer reassignment certificate.  The [director] chief administrator shall issue dealer reassignment certificates in lots upon payment of a fee of $10 for each certificate. H.   Any purchaser of a motor vehicle who fails to comply with the provisions of this section shall pay to the [director] chief administrator a penalty of $25 plus the issuing and filing fee. I.     The failure of any person to comply with the requirements of this section shall not constitute a misdemeanor within the provisions of R.S.39:10-24, nor shall such failure affect the validity of any instrument creating or reserving a security interest in a motor vehicle, as between the parties to such instrument. J.     The notation of the name and business or residence address of a secured party or his assignee, on the certificate of origin or on the certificate of ownership, as provided in R.S.39:10-8 and R.S.39:10-9, and the presentation to the [director] chief administrator, in accordance with R.S.39:10-11, of the certificate of origin or certificate of ownership so noted, and the compliance with the requirements of subsections C. and D. of R.S.39:10-11 shall be in lieu of all filing requirements imposed by chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes and shall constitute the perfection of a security interest in the motor vehicle, and the rights and remedies of the debtors and the secured parties in respect to such security interest shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, be subject to and governed by chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes. (cf: P.L.1994, c.60, s.26) 16.  R.S.39:10-19 is amended to read as follows: 39:10-19.    No person shall engage in the business of buying, selling or dealing in motor vehicles in this State, nor shall a person engage in activity that would qualify the person as a leasing dealer, as defined in section 2 of P.L.1994, c.190 (C.56:12-61), unless:  a. the person is a licensed real estate broker acting as an agent or broker in the sale of mobile homes without their own motor power other than recreation vehicles as defined in section 3 of P.L.1990, c.103 (C.39:3-10.11), or manufactured homes as defined in section 3 of P.L.1983, c.400 (C.54:4-1.4); or b. the person is authorized to do so under the provisions of this chapter and P.L.1985, c.361 (C.56:10-26 et seq.).  Notwithstanding this section or any law or regulation to the contrary, no person shall engage in business as a used motor vehicle dealer unless licensed pursuant to P.L.    , c.  (C.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) upon the effective date of that act, and the provisions of this section shall not apply to used motor vehicle dealers on or after the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.  (C.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). The chief administrator may, upon application in such form as the chief administrator prescribes, license any proper person as such dealer or leasing dealer.  A licensed real estate broker shall be entitled to act as an agent or broker in the sale of a mobile or manufactured home as defined in subsection a. of this section without obtaining a license from the chief administrator. For the purposes of this chapter, a "licensed real estate broker" means a real estate broker licensed by the New Jersey Real Estate Commission pursuant to the provisions of chapter 15 of Title 45 of the Revised Statutes.  Any sale or transfer of a mobile or manufactured home, in which a licensed real estate broker acts as a broker or agent pursuant to this section, which sale or transfer is subject to any other requirements of R.S.39:10-1 et seq., shall comply with all of those requirements. No person who has been convicted of a crime, arising out of fraud or misrepresentation in the sale, leasing or financing of a motor vehicle, shall be eligible to receive a license.  For the purposes of this section, each applicant for a license shall submit to the chief administrator the applicant's name, address, fingerprints, and written consent for a criminal history record background check to be performed.  The chief administrator is hereby authorized to exchange fingerprint data with and receive criminal history record information from the State Bureau of Identification in the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation consistent with applicable State and federal laws, rules, and regulations, for purposes of facilitating determinations concerning licensure eligibility.  The applicant shall bear the cost for the criminal history record background check, including all costs of administering and processing the check.  The Division of State Police shall promptly notify the chief administrator in the event a current holder of a license or prospective applicant, who was the subject of a criminal history record background check pursuant to this section, is arrested for a crime or offense in this State after the date the background check was performed. Each applicant for a license shall at the time such license is issued have established and maintained, or by that application shall agree to establish and maintain, within 90 days after the issuance thereof, a place of business consisting of a permanent building not less than 1,000 square feet in floor space located in the State of New Jersey to be used principally for the servicing and display of motor vehicles with such equipment installed therein as shall be requisite for the servicing of motor vehicles in such manner as to make them comply with the laws of this State and with any rules and regulations made by the board governing the equipment, use, and operation of motor vehicles within the State. However, a leasing dealer, who is not engaged in the business of buying, selling, or dealing in motor vehicles in the State, shall not be required to maintain a place of business with floor space available for the servicing or display of motor vehicles or to have an exterior sign at the lessor's place of business. A license fee of $200 shall be paid by an applicant upon the applicant's initial application for a license. The chief administrator may renew an applicant's license upon application for renewal on a form prescribed by the chief administrator and accompanied by a renewal fee of $200.  Every license shall expire 24 months from the date on which it is issued.  The chief administrator may, at the chief administrator's discretion and for good cause shown, extend an applicant's license for an additional period not to exceed 12 months from the date on which it is scheduled to expire.  The chief administrator may, at the chief administrator's discretion and for good cause shown, issue a license which shall expire on a date fixed by the chief administrator.  The fee for licenses with an expiration date fixed by the chief administrator shall be fixed by the chief administrator in an amount proportionately less or greater than the fee established herein. For the purposes of this section, a leasing dealer or an assignee of a leasing dealer whose leasing activities are limited to buying motor vehicles for the purpose of leasing them and selling motor vehicles at the termination of a lease shall not be deemed to be engaged in the business of buying, selling, or dealing in motor vehicles in this State.

STATEMENT This bill provides for the licensure of used motor vehicle dealers and establishes an eight-member State Board of Used Motor Vehicle Dealers in the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety to oversee their licensure. The board is to consist of three licensed used motor vehicle dealers, one licensed used motor vehicle dealer employed by a used motor vehicle dealer auction company, three public members, and a State executive department member. The bill provides for three types of licensure: retail used motor vehicle dealer, wholesale used motor vehicle dealer, and retail-wholesale used motor vehicle dealer.  To be eligible for licensure as a used motor vehicle dealer, an applicant is required to be at least 18 years old, be of good moral character, and fulfill the following requirements: (1)   hold a valid New Jersey drivers license demonstrating proof of residency or be an officer of a publicly traded or privately held company with a minimum of 500 domestic employees and hold a valid drivers license in the jurisdiction of the companys corporate headquarters; (2)   have an established place of business; and (3)   undergo a criminal history record background check. Under the bill, an established place of business includes a trailer, if the trailer is connected to utilities and remains in the same location for at least six months of the year. Further, under the bill, an applicant is not eligible to be licensed as a used motor vehicle dealer if the applicant has been convicted of an offense involving dishonesty, fraud, or misrepresentation, or of a crime of the first or second degree. The bill provides that no person may engage in business as a used motor vehicle dealer in this State unless that person holds a valid license or the transaction involves an in-State purchaser, who is a used motor vehicle dealer licensed under the provisions of the bill, and a person who holds a valid used motor vehicle dealer license issued by another state. As defined in the bill, "used motor vehicle means every motor vehicle and motorized bicycle, except a nonconventional type motor vehicle, for which title to, or possession of, has been transferred from the person who first acquired it from the manufacturer or dealer, and so used as to become what is commonly known as "secondhand" within the ordinary meaning of that term, and includes every motor vehicle and motorized bicycle other than a new motor vehicle, a nonconventional type motor vehicle, or a manufactured home subject to real property taxation. The bill also makes changes to several statutes relating to the licensure of motor vehicle dealers by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC), currently the regulatory authority that licenses used motor vehicle dealers in the State.  In amending these statutes, the bill clarifies that the MVC will no longer license used motor vehicle dealers on or after the bills date of enactment.
