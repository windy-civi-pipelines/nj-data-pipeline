with such equipment installed therein as shall be requisite for the servicing
of motor vehicles in such manner as to make them comply with the laws of this
State and with any rules and regulations made by the board governing the
equipment, use, and operation of motor vehicles within the State. However, a
leasing dealer, who is not engaged in the business of buying, selling, or

additional period not to exceed 12 months from the date on which it is
scheduled to expire.  The chief administrator may, at the chief administrator's
discretion and for good cause shown, issue a license which shall expire on a

motor vehicle dealers and establishes an eight-member State Board of Used Motor
Vehicle Dealers in the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law
and Public Safety to oversee their licensure. The board is to consist of three
licensed used motor vehicle dealers, one licensed used motor vehicle dealer
employed by a used motor vehicle dealer auction company, three public members,
and a State executive department member.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides for three
types of licensure: retail used motor vehicle dealer, wholesale used motor
vehicle dealer, and retail-wholesale used motor vehicle dealer.  To be eligible
for licensure as a used motor vehicle dealer, an applicant is required to be at
least 18 years old, be of good moral character, and fulfill the following
requirements:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   hold a valid New Jersey
drivers license demonstrating proof of residency or be an officer of a
publicly traded or privately held company with a minimum of 500 domestic
employees and hold a valid drivers license in the jurisdiction of the
companys corporate headquarters; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   have an established
place of business; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   undergo a criminal
history record background check.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, an established
place of business includes a trailer, if the trailer is connected to utilities
and remains in the same location for at least six months of the year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, under the bill, an
applicant is not eligible to be licensed as a used motor vehicle dealer if the
applicant has been convicted of an offense involving dishonesty, fraud, or
misrepresentation, or of a crime of the first or second degree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that no
person may engage in business as a used motor vehicle dealer in this State
unless that person holds a valid license or the transaction involves an
in-State purchaser, who is a used motor vehicle dealer licensed under the
provisions of the bill, and a person who holds a valid used motor vehicle
dealer license issued by another state.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As defined in the bill,
&quot;used motor vehicle means every motor vehicle and motorized bicycle,
except a nonconventional type motor vehicle, for which title to, or possession
of, has been transferred from the person who first acquired it from the
manufacturer or dealer, and so used as to become what is commonly known as
&quot;secondhand&quot; within the ordinary meaning of that term, and includes
every motor vehicle and motorized bicycle other than a new motor vehicle, a nonconventional
type motor vehicle, or a manufactured home subject to real property taxation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also makes changes to
several statutes relating to the licensure of motor vehicle dealers by the New
Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC), currently the regulatory authority that
licenses used motor vehicle dealers in the State.  In amending these statutes,
the bill clarifies that the MVC will no longer license used motor vehicle
dealers on or after the bills date of enactment.</p>
