<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 5 of P.L.1999,
c.45 (C.56:10-7.4) is amended to read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    It shall be a violation
of P.L.1971, c.356 (C.56:10-1 et seq.) for any motor vehicle franchisor,
directly or indirectly, through any officer, agent or employee, to engage in
any of the following practices: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     To impose unreasonable
standards of performance or unreasonable facilities, financial, operating or
other requirements upon a motor vehicle franchisee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    To base the disapproval
of the transfer, sale or assignment of a motor vehicle franchise, or any
interest therein, on the ground that the proposed transferee is not a natural
person. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     To fail to compensate a
motor vehicle franchisee for all reasonable costs incurred by the franchisee in
complying with the requirements imposed on the franchisee by the franchisor
relating to a product recall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    To utilize an arbitrary
or unreasonable formula or other calculation or process intended to gauge
performance as a basis for making any decision or taking any action governed by
P.L.1971, c.356 (C.56:10-1 et seq.). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Except as provided
pursuant to section 6 of P.L.2015, c.24 (C.56:10-27.1) <u>and section 5 of
P.L.    , c.   (C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)</u>
, to own or operate or enter into an agreement with a person, other than an
existing motor vehicle franchisee, to operate a retail facility for the
servicing of motor vehicles, which is authorized to perform warranty service on
motor vehicles manufactured or distributed by the motor vehicle franchisor. 
The establishment, relocation, reopening or reactivation of such a facility
pursuant to an agreement with a motor vehicle franchisee shall be subject to
the provisions of P.L.1982, c.156 (C.56:10-16 et seq.), except that paragraph
(3) of subsection b. of section 8 of that act (C.56:10-23) shall not be
applicable.  Notice shall be given to motor vehicle franchisees in the same
line make or makes within six miles of the proposed retail facility for the
servicing of motor vehicles which is authorized to perform warranty service on
motor vehicles manufactured or distributed by the motor vehicle franchisor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     To require an
unconditional release from a motor vehicle franchisee without permitting the
franchisee to except from the release any claims for outstanding financial
obligations of the motor vehicle franchisor to the motor vehicle franchisee for
which payment will not be made at or before the giving of the release.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g. (1) To require or attempt
to require a motor vehicle franchisee to order or purchase a new or used motor
vehicle, or any accessory or equipment thereof not required by law; or (2) to
require or attempt to require a motor vehicle franchise to accept delivery of
any motor vehicle, or any accessory or equipment thereof not required by law,
which is not as ordered by the motor vehicle franchisee; or (3) to take or
withhold or threaten to take or withhold any action, impose or threaten to
impose any penalty, or deny or threaten to deny any benefit, as a result of the
motor vehicle franchisee's failure or refusal to purchase, order or accept
delivery of any such motor vehicle, accessory or equipment. This subsection
shall not prevent a motor vehicle franchisor from requiring that a motor
vehicle franchisee carry a representative inventory of models offered for sale
by the motor vehicle franchisor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    To fail or refuse to
sell or offer to sell to all motor vehicle franchisees in a line make every
motor vehicle sold or offered for sale to any motor vehicle franchisee of the
same line make, or to fail or refuse to sell or offer to sell such motor
vehicles to all motor vehicle franchisees at the same price for a comparably
equipped motor vehicle, on the same terms, with no differential in discount,
allowance, credit or bonus, and on reasonable, good faith and
non-discriminatory allocation and availability terms.  However, the failure to
deliver any such motor vehicle shall not be considered a violation of this
section if the failure is not arbitrary and is due to a lack of manufacturing
capacity or to a strike or labor difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
embargo or other cause over which the franchisor has no control.  A motor
vehicle franchisor shall not require a motor vehicle franchisee to purchase
unreasonable quantities of advertising materials, purchase special tools not
required to properly service a motor vehicle or undertake sales person or
service person training unrelated to the motor vehicle or meet unreasonable
display requirements as a condition of receiving a motor vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Unless compelled by law
or legal process, (1) if the customer has objected thereto in writing, to
require a motor vehicle franchisee to publish, release, convey or otherwise
provide information obtained with respect to any customers, contracts,
products, services or other transactions of the motor vehicle franchisee which
is not necessary for the motor vehicle franchisor to meet its obligations to
consumers or the motor vehicle franchisee, including vehicle recalls or other
requirements imposed by State or federal law, or for complying with the duties
or obligations of the respective parties under the franchise; or (2) to release
such information which has been provided to it by the motor vehicle franchisees
to any third party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     To impose or attempt to
impose any requirement, limitation or regulation on, or interfere or attempt to
interfere with, the manner in which a motor vehicle franchisee utilizes the
