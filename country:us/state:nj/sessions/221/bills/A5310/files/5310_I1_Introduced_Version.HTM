<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes various
changes to State school aid, including extraordinary special education aid and
vocational expansion stabilization aid, and establishes a new category of State
school aid known as reduction adjustment aid.&nbsp; The bill also includes
certain additional requirements for the issuance of the Educational Adequacy
Report.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill
requires the Department of Education to make available on the departments
Internet website the calculation of aid payable to each school district in the
succeeding year in a user-friendly manner, including explanations of the
variables used to determine the districts aid.  The information is required to
be posted each year within two days of the Governors Budget Message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under
current law, a school district is reimbursed for certain special education
costs in the form of extraordinary special education aid.&nbsp;
However,&nbsp;in recent years the States appropriation for extraordinary
special education aid has covered only a portion of eligible costs provided in
state, with the percentage covered fluctuating from year to year.&nbsp;The bill
requires the State to increase the appropriation from year to year, or
otherwise&nbsp;ensure that the percentage of a school districts costs
reimbursed through extraordinary special education aid increases compared to
the previous fiscal year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally, the bill provides that the amount of vocational expansion
stabilization aid received by a county vocational school district is to be
adjusted to allow for increases in resident enrollment.&nbsp; The adjustment is
to equal the number of additional students enrolled in the district multiplied
by the additional cost per pupil for county vocational school districts and the
geographic cost adjustment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill
also establishes certain municipal overburden protections to prevent a school
district from receiving a reduction in State school aid.&nbsp; Pursuant to the
bill, an SDA district would not be subject to a reduction in State school aid
if it is located in a municipality in which the equalized total tax rate is
greater than the Statewide average equalized total tax rate for the most
recently available calendar year and if the district is spending below
adequacy.&nbsp; In the case of a school district other than an SDA district,
the district would not be subject to a reduction in State school aid if it is
located in a municipality in which the equalized total tax rate is at least 10
percent greater than the Statewide average equalized total tax rate for the
most recently available calendar year and is spending at least 10 percent below
adequacy.&nbsp; These municipal overburden protections would also apply to a
regional school district if 50 percent or more of the districts constituent
districts or municipalities met either of the aforementioned qualifying criteria.&nbsp;
An SDA district that is spending above adequacy would not be subject to a
reduction in State school aid that exceeds the amount by which the district is
spending above adequacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill
also establishes reduction adjustment aid to ensure that the amount of State
school aid provided to a school district is not decreased by more than two
percent of the districts prebudget year total operating budget.&nbsp; The
total operating budget is defined as the sum of a districts general fund
revenues from local sources, State sources, federal sources, and other sources,
less any withdrawals from reserve accounts and reimbursements for extraordinary
special education aid.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally, the bill makes certain changes to the Educational Adequacy
Report, which is submitted to the Legislature every three years to update the
various parameters used to calculate State aid to school districts.&nbsp;
Pursuant to the bill, the Commissioner of Education may initiate a review of
certain elements of the school funding formula, including the metrics for
adjusting costs in intervening years between reports.&nbsp; Additionally, the
bill requires that a draft of the Educational Adequacy Report be made available
for public comment for at least 30 days, during which time members of the
public may provide remarks on the draft report at public hearings to be held at
various locations across the State and through the submission of written and
electronic testimony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the
development of the next Educational Adequacy Report following enactment of this
bill, the commissioner is to engage a diverse group of stakeholders to review
and make recommendations concerning: the calculation of a districts local
share and whether the metrics used are best able to estimate a districts
potential adjusted tax levy; the impact and feasibility of using multi-year
averages in the calculation of local share; the abilities of the Department of
Education and school districts to predict and anticipate State school aid
amounts from year to year; and possible methods of improving upon the existing
preschool funding methodology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill establishes
the&nbsp;Special Education Funding Review Task Force&nbsp;for the purpose of assessing
the effectiveness of State aid provided to support special education costs,
examining the possibility of a tier-based model for special education funding,
and making recommendations regarding the implementation of a tier-based funding
model. The task force is to consist of 11 members, each of whom is to have a
background in, or special knowledge of, the legal, policy, and administrative
aspects of special education in New Jersey.  The task force is to issue a final
report detailing its findings and recommendations to the Governor and the
Legislature no later than one year after the organization of the task force. </p>
