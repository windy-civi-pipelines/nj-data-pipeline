Section 1:
S2638 SENATE, No. 2638 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 8, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  PARKER SPACE District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) SYNOPSIS Allows individuals that have undergone certain background checks, including individuals with certain commercial driver license endorsements, to renew license online or by mail. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the renewal of certain driver licenses and supplementing Title 39 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    An individual possessing a valid driver license pursuant to the provisions of R.S.39:3-10 and valid commercial driver license pursuant to the provisions of the New Jersey Commercial Driver License Act, P.L.1990, c.103 (C.39:3-10.9 et seq.) who also possesses either a federal Transportation Worker Identification Credential, issued by the federal Transportation Security Administration; or a commercial driver license endorsement for the transport of hazardous materials, which includes fingerprinting and background check requirements to be conducted by the federal Transportation Security Administration, shall be allowed to renew the individuals existing driver license and commercial driver license as a REAL-ID compliant version of each of those licenses by mail or through the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission Internet website and shall not be required to renew in-person at a commission agency. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill permits individuals with a valid driver license and commercial driver license who also have either: 1) a federal Transportation Worker Identification Credential issued by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA); or 2) an endorsement to transport hazardous materials with a required TSA fingerprinting and background check, to renew their licenses as REAL-ID compliant versions by mail or the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) Internet website, and not in-person at an MVC agency. These individuals have already met federal REAL ID requirements as a result of having acquired certain federal TSA documents with requirements that are equal to or greater than REAL ID standards. As a result, it is reasonable to allow these individuals to renew their licenses as REAL ID versions without having to do so in person, given the lengthy wait times for in-person appointments to conduct REAL ID license transactions at this moment in time.
