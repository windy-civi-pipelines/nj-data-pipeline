<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning nuclear energy, amending P.L.2007, c.340,
and supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section) Sections 1
through 6 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the
&quot;Small Modular Nuclear Energy Incentive Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  (New section) a.  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  Nuclear fission is a cost
effective, safe, and reliable method of generating electricity without emitting
greenhouse gases;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Solar and wind power do
not provide constant power output, rendering them unsuitable for replacing coal
and natural gas as the primary methods of electricity generation, meaning that
the State will be unable to reach its clean energy goals through the use of
solar and wind power alone;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Nuclear reactors, by
contrast, provide constant power output, and its fuel prices are not subject to
the frequent and unpredictable fluctuations in oil prices;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  Private industries, with
the support of the federal Department of Energy, are developing a new type of
nuclear fission reactor, known as small modular reactors (SMRs), which are
designed to be compact, be capable of being factory-assembled and transported
to a location for installation, and to generate sufficient electricity to power
up to hundreds of thousands of homes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  SMRs are designed to be
simpler and safer than conventional nuclear reactors, often relying on passive
systems and inherent safety characteristics, such as natural circulation,
convection, gravity, and self-pressurization, to keep the reactor within
acceptable operating parameters, reducing the possibility of human error and
making them less prone to malicious attacks;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  In addition, SMRs are
designed to require refueling only every three to seven years, as opposed
conventional reactors, which require refueling every one to two years, and some
SMRs are designed to operate for up to 30 years without refueling; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)  The United States has
nearly four gigawatts of announced SMR projects, in addition to almost three
gigawatts in early development or pre-development stages, according to a 2024
report by the energy data analytics firm Wood Mackenzie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  It is therefore in the
public interest for New Jersey to establish a program to incentivize and
attract the construction of small modular reactors, in order to provide
reliable electricity to the State, replace the jobs lost through retiring
nuclear, coal, and natural gas power plants, and help the State meet its clean
energy goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  (New section) As used in P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Board&quot; means the
Board of Public Utilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Small modular reactor&quot;
or &quot;SMR&quot; means a nuclear fission reactor that:  (1) has a rated
electric generating capacity of not more than 300 megawatts; (2) is capable of
being constructed and operated either alone or in combination with one or more
similar reactors if additional reactors are or become necessary at a single
site; and (3) is required to be licensed by the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;SMR incentive&quot;
means a pecuniary incentive, provided per megawatt hour of electric energy
produced by an SMR that is selected through the competitive solicitation
program established by P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Transmission and
distribution system&quot; means the same as the term is defined in section 3 of
P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-51).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  (New section) a.  No later
than one year after the effective date of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill), the board shall develop a competitive
solicitation program for awarding SMR incentive contracts to promote the
construction of small modular nuclear reactors in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  In order to be eligible to
participate in a solicitation process administered by the board pursuant to
this section, a project for the construction of small modular nuclear reactor
shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) commence after the
effective date of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill); and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, to be known as the &quot;Small

Utilities (BPU) to establish a program to solicit bids for the construction of
new small modular nuclear reactors in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would authorize the
BPU to issue financial incentives to SMRs, to be known as SMR incentives, for
each megawatt hour of electric energy produced by the reactor.  The amount of
the incentive would be determined through a competitive solicitation process. 
Private entities would submit bids to the BPU, which state the level of SMR
incentive they estimate they would require to achieve profitability.  The BPU
would select the lowest bids, except that the bill authorizes the BPU to give
preference to certain projects, for example projects sited at former nuclear
energy facilities or fossil fuel power plants.  The bill would authorize the
BPU to use moneys in the &quot;Global Warming Solutions Fund,&quot; which
serves as the repository for funds collected by the State under the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), in order to fund the SMR incentives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would direct the BPU
to develop the program within one year after the bill's enactment, and to begin
the first competitive solicitation round within two years after the bill's
enactment.  The bill would restrict the owner or operator of an SMR that
receives an incentive from otherwise profiting from the environmental
attributes of the energy it produces.  Finally, the bill would require each SMR
that is selected to participate in the incentive program to pay an annual
administrative fee to the BPU, to compensate the BPU for its costs in
administering the program.</p>
