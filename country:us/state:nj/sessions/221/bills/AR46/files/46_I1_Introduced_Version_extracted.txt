STATEMENT This resolution strongly condemns speech and rhetoric that threatens law enforcement personnel and incites violence against them. Recent news reports include accounts of individuals statements and group demonstrations demonizing police as murderers.  Law enforcement officers in New Jersey and throughout the nation serve the public honorably, protecting all people regardless of religion, race, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, or socio-economic status, and risk their own lives every day in pursuit of this duty despite the inherent dangers and risks associated with this profession. Law enforcement officials are properly subject to scrutiny of their actions and are held responsible for them.  While a number of instances have given rise to questions concerning the judgment exercised by certain officers, the disruptive and violent actions of some individuals and groups are provoking unwarranted violence against law enforcement. There is no justification for targeting and, at worst, assassinating members of the force, who deserve respect and gratitude for the selfless acts they perform to serve and protect all people.  Outside of their law enforcement roles, officers are private citizens with families, friends, and neighbors who deserve the same freedoms and protections to live their lives as any other person in New Jersey and this country.
