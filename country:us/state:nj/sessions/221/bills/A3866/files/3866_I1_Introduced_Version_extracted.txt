This bill provides that the mileage reimbursement rate payable to a State officer or employee driving a private automobile on State business will be the same as the standard mileage rate established by the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the deductible cost of operating an automobile for business purposes. The bill repeals the provision of current law that requires adjustment twice each year to reflect changes in the price of gasoline.
