In the decades that followed, nearly all of the major United States diner builders, including Jerry OMahony Inc., started operating in New Jersey. Due to New Jerseys location between Philadelphia and New York City, New Jersey built highly developed transportation systems and road networks for commuters traveling between the two metropolitan hubs. As busy commuters traveled between these three states, New Jerseys 24-hour diners became destinations to eat and rest. Travelers and locals alike sought out these diners for an affordable, convenient meal. New Jersey is home to approximately 525 diners, the most diners in any state. Diners play an important role in New Jerseys economy and culture and should be celebrated.
