(2)  If the department approves the maintenance plan, the public community water system shall implement the plan within 30 days after receipt of approval from the department or within another timeframe agreed to by the department.  If the plan is disapproved, the department shall inform the owner or operator of the public community water system of the reasons for the disapproval, and the owner or operator shall have 30 days thereafter to submit a revised plan to the department.  If the department conditionally approves the maintenance plan, the owner or operator of the public community water system, shall implement the plan, subject to any modifications or additional requirements imposed by the department in association with the conditional approval, within 30 days after the plan has been deemed conditionally approved. (3)  If, at the conclusion of the time period ending 90 days after receipt, by the department, of a completed maintenance plan, the department has not approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved the plan pursuant to this subsection, the plan shall be deemed to be approved. e.  The department may, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt rules or regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require a public community water system to sample and test the water supply on a quarterly basis for compliance with secondary drinking water regulations in accordance with testing protocols established by the Department of Environmental Protection (department).  The testing protocols, in addition to requiring sampling when the water enters the distribution system, would require the public community water system to collect samples for testing from at least 10 percent of customer taps.  The bill would also require that the owner or operator of a public community water system submit quarterly and annual test results to the department, to the governing body of each municipality within its service area, and to customers of the system.  The bill would further require, whenever the test results of a water supply exceed the standards established in the secondary drinking water regulations, that the owner or operator of the public community water system formulate a compliance plan, within 30 days,  that provides for the public community water system to take any action necessary to bring the water supply into compliance with the standard within 30 days after the plans completion.  Finally, the bill would require that the public community water system also develop and submit, for department approval, a maintenance plan for the system to ensure that the water supply continues to meet the standards set forth in the States secondary drinking water regulations.
