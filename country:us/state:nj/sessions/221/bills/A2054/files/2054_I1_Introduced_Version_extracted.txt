Additionally, the BME, in consultation with the Commissioners of Health and Human Services, will be required to develop a program to promote the use of MAT.  The program is to include an education and outreach campaign to improve physician awareness of the availability of MAT, provide information and resources concerning the training and federal waiver requirements to become authorized to prescribe and administer certain forms of MAT, and advise physicians of the availability of MAT support services.  In addition, the program is to study and implement initiatives to encourage physicians and other authorized health care providers in the State to obtain federal authorization to prescribe narcotic drugs that are Schedule III, IV, or V controlled dangerous substances for maintenance or detoxification treatment.  The program will also include technical assistance and additional training to physicians seeking to provide MAT, which support and assistance may include the use of telehealth and telemedicine to provide remote consultations with addiction medicine specialists.  Finally, the program is to provide outreach and support services to other health care professionals, including, but not limited to, physician assistants, advanced practice nurses, and certified nurse midwives, who seek to provide MAT.
