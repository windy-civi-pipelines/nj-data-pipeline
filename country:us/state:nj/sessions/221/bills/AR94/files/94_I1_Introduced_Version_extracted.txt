AR94 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 94 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  BENJIE E. WIMBERLY District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Urges Federal Bureau of Investigation to categorize white supremacists as domestic terrorists. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Assembly Resolution urging the Federal Bureau of Investigation to categorize white supremacists and white nationalists as domestic terrorists. Whereas, White extremists have been killing citizens in this country in an array of public places at an increasingly alarming rate, often employing high-powered firearms, as evidenced by a recent mass shooting in an El Paso, Texas Walmart in which 22 people were killed, followed shortly thereafter by another shooting in Dayton, Ohio, in which 13 people were killed; and Whereas, Since 9/11,  almost three times as many terrorist attacks in the United States have been by white supremacists and other far-right extremists than by Islamic terrorists; and Whereas, According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the overall number of domestic terrorism investigations is decreasing, but the number of domestic terrorism investigations targeting white supremacists, white nationalists, and other racially-motivated persons is increasing; and Whereas, There is no federal crime of domestic terrorism with which these perpetrators specifically can be charged; and Whereas, The FBI defines domestic terrorism as the unlawful use, or threatened use, of force or violence by a group or individual based and operating entirely within the United States or Puerto Rico without foreign direction committed against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives; and Whereas, Despite the rise in violence attributed to white supremacist and nationalist groups, the FBI often classifies these acts as hate crimes or gang-related crimes, rather than domestic terrorism; and Whereas, The FBI accords domestic terrorism cases higher priority than hate and gang crimes, which results in more resources, including the assignment of counterterrorism agents, being dedicated to fight domestic terrorism; and Whereas, When deadly hate crimes are not classified as terrorism, the crimes often are investigated and prosecuted by State and local law enforcement agencies who are less equipped and have fewer resources with which to respond; and Whereas, White supremacists and white nationalists have become the face of terrorism in the United States; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House urges the Federal Bureau of Investigation to categorize as domestic terrorism those crimes committed by members of white supremacy and white nationalist groups in the United States to increase the priority of these cases and consequently the resources allocated to their investigation and prosecution. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, each member of the United States Congress elected from this State, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. STATEMENT This Assembly resolution urges the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to classify as domestic terrorism those crimes committed by members of white supremacy and white nationalist groups in the United States.  Prioritizing domestic terrorism cases will result in the allocation of more resources to the investigation and prosecution of these heinous crimes. White extremists have been killing citizens in this country in an array of public places at an increasingly alarming rate.  Since 9/11, almost three times as many terrorist attacks in the United States have been by white supremacists and other far-right extremists than by Islamic terrorists. There is no federal crime of domestic terrorism with which these perpetrators specifically can be charged. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as the unlawful use, or threatened use, of force or violence by a group or individual based and operating entirely within the United States or Puerto Rico without foreign direction committed against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives.  Despite the rise in violence attributed to white supremacist and nationalist groups, the FBI often classifies these acts as hate crimes or gang-related crimes, rather than domestic terrorism.  The FBI accords domestic terrorism cases higher priority than hate and gang crimes, which results in more resources, including the assignment of counterterrorism agents, being dedicated to fight domestic terrorism.  When deadly hate crimes are not classified as terrorism, the crimes often are investigated and prosecuted by State and local law enforcement agencies who are less equipped and have fewer resources with which to respond. Because white supremacists and white nationalists have become the face of terrorism in the United States, the crimes they commit should be considered domestic terrorism by the FBI.
