The EPA has found that PCE is associated with health risks such as damage to the kidney, liver, and immune system, neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, and cancer from inhalation or skin exposure.  TCE is a volatile organic compound that is used in industrial cleaning and degreasing applications, lubricants, adhesives and sealants, paints and coatings, automotive care products, cleaning products, and furniture care products.  The EPA has found that TCE is associated with health risks including liver cancer, kidney cancer, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
