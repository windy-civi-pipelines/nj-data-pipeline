(C.30:11B-2), shall be fully credited pursuant to rules promulgated or to be
promulgated by the council, to the extent that the units are affordable to
persons of low and moderate income and are available to the general public.</p>

any municipality seeking substantive certification, shall require that a
minimum percentage of housing units in any residential development resulting
from a zoning change made to a previously non-residentially-zoned property, where
the change in zoning precedes or follows the application for residential
development by no more than 24 months, be reserved for occupancy by low or
moderate income households, which percentage shall be determined by the council
based on economic feasibility with consideration for the proposed density of
development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In carrying out the above
duties, including, but not limited to, present and prospective need estimations
the council shall give appropriate weight to pertinent research studies,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Although the Fair Housing
Act, P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), clearly states that the State
Constitutions affordable housing obligation is comprised of the present and
prospective need for affordable housing only, some courts have misunderstood the
intent of the Legislature behind the Fair Housing Act, and imposed a
retroactive obligation for the so-called gap period. The purpose of this bill
is to eliminate any possible misconception with respect to the Legislatures
intent to ensure that determinations of a municipalitys fair share of
affordable housing will be based upon the present and prospective need for
affordable housing, as clearly set forth in the Fair Housing Act, and that a
fair share obligation will not include retrospective need that may have arisen
during any gap period between housing cycles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The New Jersey Supreme Court,
through its rulings in <u>South</u> <u>Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel</u>,
67 <u>N.J.</u> 151 (1975) and <u>South Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel</u>,
92 <u>N.J.</u> 158 (1983), determined that every municipality in a growth area
has a constitutional obligation to provide through its land use regulations a
realistic opportunity for a fair share of its region's present and prospective
needs for housing for low and moderate income families.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     By enacting the Fair Housing
Act, the Legislature accepted the Supreme Courts request that the Legislature
occupy the field of affordable housing and defined the constitutional
obligation to include the present and prospective needs for affordable housing
only. The Legislature directed each municipality to comply with its
constitutional obligation to address its obligations with respect to the
present and prospective need by:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     including in the housing
element of its master plan a determination of the municipality's present and
prospective fair share for low and moderate income housing and a determination
of the municipalitys capacity to accommodate its present and prospective
housing needs, including its fair share for low and moderate income housing as
the present and prospective need; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     adopting or revising land use
and other relevant ordinances consistent with the provisions for low and
moderate income housing in its housing element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The courts and the Legislature
of this State require municipalities to allow low and moderate income families
a chance to find housing based upon the present need and the prospective need
for affordable housing in each municipality and region of the State.  This
requirement has always been about planning and zoning; municipalities may not
limit opportunities for affordable housing through exclusionary zoning.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Differences of opinion between
the judicial and executive branches of government over how to calculate each
municipalitys fair share of affordable housing have resulted in a gap
period of over 15 years, which is still going on, during which the State
provided municipalities no clear guidelines on how to zone to satisfy their
obligation to allow for a fair share of affordable housing.  Now that the
courts have assumed control over municipal compliance with affordable housing
obligations, it is possible that municipalities may be obligated to allow for
the production of affordable housing based upon the speculated need for
affordable housing which arose during the gap period.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     While laudable, such a result
is contrary to current law, which confines municipal fair share determinations
to a present and prospective need for affordable housing, and would impose an
unrealistic and excessive burden upon the residential communities of our
State.  Requiring fair share obligations to include the need developed through
a long regulatory gap period would result in an unreasonable burden, the
resolution of which would force municipalities to allow rapid, unsettling
changes to the physical and demographic nature of their communities. This bill
eliminates any possible misconception of what the Legislature intended the fair
share obligation to include so as to preclude the imposition of a fair share
obligation based upon a concept of retrospective need during the gap period.</p>
