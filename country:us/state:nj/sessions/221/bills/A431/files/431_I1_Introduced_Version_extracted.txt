Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph to the contrary, for the period from  the 2016 implementation date  through December 31, 2016, no rate of tax shall be applied to diesel fuel, blended fuel that contains diesel fuel or is intended for use as diesel fuel, or kerosene, other than aviation grade kerosene; for the period from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, the applicable rate for those fuels shall be 70 percent of the rate otherwise determined pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, and for July 1, 2017 and thereafter the applicable rate for those fuels determined pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (e)   [The cents-per-gallon rate determined pursuant to subparagraph (d) of this paragraph shall not be less than the rate determined for the  average retail price per gallon of number 2 diesel in the State on July 1, 2016.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (f)   [The applicable tax rate for fuel oil determined pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall be converted to a cents-per-gallon rate, rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent, and adjusted quarterly by the director, effective on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April 1, to reflect the average price per gallon, without State or federal tax included, of retail sales of number 2 fuel oil in the State, as determined in the most recent survey of retail diesel fuel prices that included a Statewide representative random sample conducted by the Board of Public Utilities, Office of the Economist, or its successor.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (g)   [The cents-per-gallon rate determined pursuant to subparagraph (f) of this paragraph shall not be less than the rate determined for the  average price per gallon, without State or federal tax included, of retail sales of number 2 fuel oil in the State on July 1, 2016.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (h)  [On and after the 10th day following a certification by the review council pursuant to subsection c. of section    19 of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.52:18A-257), no tax shall be imposed pursuant to this paragraph.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (2)  (a)  [In addition to the tax, if any, imposed by paragraph (1) of this subsection, a cents-per-gallon tax is imposed on each company's gross receipts derived from the first sale of petroleum products within this State on gasoline, blended fuel that contains gasoline or that is intended for use as gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas, and aviation fuel at the rate of four cents per gallon; and] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (b)   [In addition to the tax, if any, imposed by paragraph (1) of this subsection, a cents-per-gallon tax is imposed on each company's gross receipts derived from the first sale of petroleum products within this State on diesel fuel, blended fuel that contains diesel fuel or is intended for use as diesel fuel, and kerosene, other than aviation grade kerosene, at the rate of four cents per gallon before July 1, 2017 and at the rate of eight cents per gallon on and after July 1, 2017.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) b.    There is imposed on each company that imports or causes to be imported, other than by a company subject to and having paid the tax on those imported petroleum products that have generated gross receipts taxable under subsection a. of this section, petroleum products for use or consumption by it within this State a tax at the rate [or rates, determined pursuant to subsection a. of this section,] of four cents per gallon on the consideration given or contracted to be given and the gallonage  for such petroleum products if the consideration given or contracted to be given for all such deliveries made during a quarterly period exceeds $5,000. c.  [(1) For State fiscal years 2018 through 2026, the rate of tax imposed on highway fuel pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall be adjusted annually so that the total revenue derived from highway fuel shall not exceed the highway fuel cap amount.

(4)   Upon consideration of the result of the determination pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, and consultation with the Legislative Budget and Finance Officer, the State Treasurer shall determine the rate of tax to be imposed on highway fuel pursuant to subsection a. of this section that will result in revenue from: (a)   the taxes collected on highway fuel for the current State Fiscal Year pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2010, c.22 (C.54:39-103), (b)   the revenue derived from the tax imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section on highway fuel at the rate of four cents per gallon for the current State Fiscal Year, and (c)   the revenue derived from the taxation of highway fuel pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section equaling the highway fuel cap amount determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection; and that rate shall take effect on  October 1 of that year. (5)   If the actual revenue determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection exceeds the highway fuel cap amount determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the highway fuel cap amount for the succeeding year shall be decreased by the amount of the excess in setting the rate pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection.  If the actual revenue determined pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection is less than the highway fuel cap amount determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the highway fuel cap amount for the succeeding year shall be increased by the amount of the shortfall in setting the rate pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (cf: P.L.2016, c.57, s.14) 2.    Section 19 of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.52:18A-257) is repealed. 3.    The State Treasurer, in consultation with the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority, shall ensure, to the extent practicable, that the rights of bondholders are not negatively impacted by the provisions of P.L.    , c.    . 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill reduces the petroleum products gross receipts tax to four cents per gallon, which was the effective tax rate in 2016 prior to the taxs most recent legislative revision.  In 2016, the State increased three components of the petroleum products gross receipts tax (PPGRT): (1) the tax on motor fuels was increased by 12.85 %; (2) the tax on non-motor fuels was increased from 2.75% to 7%; and (3) the tax on diesel fuels was increased four cents per gallon.  The largest part of this increase was that tax on motor fuels, which effectively amounted to an increase in 23 cents per gallon.  Because the law included a provision that allows the State Treasurer to modify the tax rate based on fuel consumption and revenue collections, the total tax on motor fuels under the PPGRT currently sits at 31.9 cents per gallon.  This bill would eliminate all three components of the 2016 tax increase and any subsequent PPGRT increases that have been imposed by the State Treasurer, reverting the PPGRT back to four cents per gallon and thereby reducing the cost of gasoline for consumers. The bill also eliminates the power of the State Treasurer to modify the tax based on fuel consumption and eliminates a review council connected to the 2016 legislative revision.  Any future changes to the tax would be required to be enacted by the Legislature and approved by the Governor. The bill provides that the State Treasurer, in consultation with the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority, is to ensure that the rights of bondholders are not negatively impacted by the provisions of the bill.
