The Legislature further declares its opposition to such practices of discrimination when directed against any person by reason of the race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, marital status, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, disability or nationality of that person or that person's family members, partners, members, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, superintendents, agents, employees, interns, business associates, suppliers, or customers, in order that the economic prosperity and general welfare of the inhabitants of the State may be protected and ensured. The Legislature further finds that because of discrimination, people suffer personal hardships, and the State suffers a grievous harm.  The personal hardships include: economic loss; time loss; physical and emotional stress; and in some cases severe emotional trauma, illness, homelessness or other irreparable harm resulting from the strain of employment or employer internship controversies; relocation, search and moving difficulties; anxiety caused by lack of information, uncertainty, and resultant planning difficulty; career, education, family and social disruption; and adjustment problems, which particularly impact on those protected by this act.  Such harms have, under the common law, given rise to legal remedies, including compensatory and punitive damages.  The Legislature intends that such damages be available to all persons protected by this act and that this act shall be liberally construed in combination with other protections available under the laws of this State.

Nothing in this subsection q. shall be construed as reducing: (a)   The number of the hours worked by the employee which are counted towards the accruing of seniority, pension or other benefits; or (b)   Any premium wages or benefits provided to an employee pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. (2)   For an employer to refuse to permit an employee or intern to utilize leave, as provided for in this subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employee's or interns sincerely held religious observance or practice.  Except where it would cause an employer to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at his place of employment or internship during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement of his religion, he observes as his Sabbath or other holy day, including a reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between his place of employment or internship and his home; provided that any such absence from work shall, wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time, or shall, if applicable, be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by the employer of that person as leave taken without pay. (3)   (a)  For purposes of this subsection q., "undue hardship" means an accommodation requiring unreasonable expense or difficulty, unreasonable interference with the safe or efficient operation of the workplace or a violation of a bona fide seniority system or a violation of any provision of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. (b)   In determining whether the accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the factors considered shall include: (i)    The identifiable cost of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer. (ii)   The number of individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held religious observance or practice. (iii) For an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. (c)   An accommodation shall be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the inability of an employee or intern to perform the essential functions of the position in which he or she is employed or engaged as an intern. (d)   (i)  The provisions of this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees or interns. (ii)   This subsection q. shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of attendance to employees or interns is essential to prevent undue hardship to the employer.  The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph (d) shall be upon the employer. r.     For any employer to take reprisals against any employee or intern for requesting from, discussing with, or disclosing to, any other employee or former employee, or any other intern or former intern of the employer, a lawyer from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation, including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee, or any intern or former intern, of the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to, or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an employee or intern to disclose such information about the employee or intern herself to any other employee or former employee, or intern or former intern, of the employer or to any authorized representative [of the other employee or former employee] thereof. s.     For an employer to treat, for employment-related or internship-related purposes, a woman employee or intern that the employer knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  In addition, an employer of an employee or intern who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make available to the employee or intern reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the pregnancy when the employee or intern, based on the advice of her physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of a employee breast feeding her infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee or intern in terms, conditions or privileges of employment or internship for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee or intern affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees or interns not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any employee's or interns rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding. For the purposes of this section "pregnancy or breastfeeding" means pregnancy, childbirth, and breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from childbirth. For the purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity requirement. t.     For an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates: (1)   That the differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity or quality of production; (2)   That the factor or factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class; (3)   That each of the factors is applied reasonably; (4)   That one or more of the factors account for the entire wage differential; and (5)   That the factors are job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Comparisons of wage rates shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. For the purposes of this subsection, "member of a protected class" means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or liability for service in the armed forces, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or requiring to retire from employment or discriminating against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment. (cf: P.L.2021, c.248, s.2) 8.    Section 1 of P.L.2001, c.385 (C.10:5-12.6) is amended to read as follows: 1.    No employer, public or private, shall discharge or discriminate against an employee or intern in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment or internship for displaying the American flag on the employee's or interns person or work station, provided the display does not substantially and materially interfere with the employee's or interns job duties.  An employer who discharges or discriminates against an employee or intern as described in this section shall be liable to the employee or intern for damages caused by the discharge or discrimination, including punitive damages, and for reasonable attorney's fees as part of the costs of any action for damages.  If the court determines that the action for damages was brought without substantial justification, the court may award costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the employer.

[This act] P.L.2006, c.53 (C.34:19-9 et seq.) shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer from permitting its employees or interns to voluntarily attend employer-sponsored meetings or providing other communications to the employees or interns, if the employer notifies the employees or interns that they may refuse to attend the meetings or accept the communications without penalty.

STATEMENT The bill designated the New Jersey Intern Protection Act, provides legal protections and remedies for persons engaged in internships with employers.  It does so by adding interns to the provisions of the Law Against Discrimination, P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, P.L.1986, c.105 (C.34:19-1 et seq.), and P.L.2006, c.53 (C.34:19-9 et seq.), sometimes referred to as the Worker Freedom From Employer Intimidation Act. Under all three enactments, an intern would be defined as an individual who performs services for an employer on a temporary basis whose work: (1) Provides training or supplements training given in an educational environment such that the employability of the individual performing the work may be enhanced; (2) Provides experience for the benefit of the individual performing the work; and (3)  Is performed under the supervision of existing staff.  The term intern includes individuals without regard to whether the employer pays them a salary or wage. An intern would not only have recognized and enforceable legal protections from various forms of employer discrimination, retaliatory acts, and intimidation relative to religious and political matters in the workplace, the State would also have the authority, under the Law Against Discrimination, P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), to bring actions against employers.  In addition, nothing within the provisions of this bill or the various past legislative acts amended by this bill would prevent an intern from seeking protections or receiving remedies pursuant to any applicable federal law, other State law, or the common law.

Such prohibited conduct shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   Buying from, selling to, leasing from or to, licensing, contracting with, trading with, providing goods, services, or information to, or otherwise doing business with any person because that person does, or agrees or attempts to do, any such act or any act prohibited by this subsection; or (2)   Boycotting, commercially blacklisting or refusing to buy from, sell to, lease from or to, license, contract with, provide goods, services or information to, or otherwise do business with any person because that person has not done or refuses to do any such act or any act prohibited by this subsection; provided that this subsection shall not prohibit refusals or other actions either pertaining to employee-employer collective bargaining, labor disputes, or unfair labor practices, or made or taken in connection with a protest of unlawful discrimination or unlawful employment practices. o.    For any multiple listing service, real estate brokers' organization or other service, organization or facility related to the business of selling or renting dwellings to deny any person access to or membership or participation in such organization, or to discriminate against such person in the terms or conditions of such access, membership, or participation, on account of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, familial status, pregnancy or breastfeeding, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, disability, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States or nationality. p.    Nothing in the provisions of this section shall affect the ability of an employer to require employees or interns to adhere to reasonable workplace appearance, grooming and dress standards not precluded by other provisions of State or federal law, except that an employer shall allow an employee or intern to appear, groom and dress consistent with the employee's or interns gender identity or expression. q.    (1)  For any employer to impose upon a person as a condition of obtaining or retaining employment or internship, including opportunities for promotion, advancement or transfers, any terms or conditions that would require a person to violate or forego a sincerely held religious practice or religious observance, including but not limited to the observance of any particular day or days or any portion thereof as a Sabbath or other holy day in accordance with the requirements of the religion or religious belief, unless, after engaging in a bona fide effort, the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate the employee's or interns religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall not be entitled to premium wages or premium benefits for work performed during hours to which those premium wages or premium benefits would ordinarily be applicable, if the employee is working during those hours only as an accommodation to his religious requirements. Nothing in this subsection q. shall be construed as reducing: (a)   The number of the hours worked by the employee which are counted towards the accruing of seniority, pension or other benefits; or (b)   Any premium wages or benefits provided to an employee pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. (2)   For an employer to refuse to permit an employee or intern to utilize leave, as provided for in this subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employee's or interns sincerely held religious observance or practice.  Except where it would cause an employer to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at his place of employment or internship during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement of his religion, he observes as his Sabbath or other holy day, including a reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between his place of employment or internship and his home; provided that any such absence from work shall, wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time, or shall, if applicable, be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by the employer of that person as leave taken without pay. (3)   (a)  For purposes of this subsection q., "undue hardship" means an accommodation requiring unreasonable expense or difficulty, unreasonable interference with the safe or efficient operation of the workplace or a violation of a bona fide seniority system or a violation of any provision of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. (b)   In determining whether the accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the factors considered shall include: (i)    The identifiable cost of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer. (ii)   The number of individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held religious observance or practice. (iii) For an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. (c)   An accommodation shall be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the inability of an employee or intern to perform the essential functions of the position in which he or she is employed or engaged as an intern. (d)   (i)  The provisions of this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees or interns. (ii)   This subsection q. shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of attendance to employees or interns is essential to prevent undue hardship to the employer.  The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph (d) shall be upon the employer. r.     For any employer to take reprisals against any employee or intern for requesting from, discussing with, or disclosing to, any other employee or former employee, or any other intern or former intern of the employer, a lawyer from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation, including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee, or any intern or former intern, of the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to, or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an employee or intern to disclose such information about the employee or intern herself to any other employee or former employee, or intern or former intern, of the employer or to any authorized representative [of the other employee or former employee] thereof. s.     For an employer to treat, for employment-related or internship-related purposes, a woman employee or intern that the employer knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  In addition, an employer of an employee or intern who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make available to the employee or intern reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the pregnancy when the employee or intern, based on the advice of her physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of a employee breast feeding her infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee or intern in terms, conditions or privileges of employment or internship for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee or intern affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees or interns not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any employee's or interns rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding. For the purposes of this section "pregnancy or breastfeeding" means pregnancy, childbirth, and breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from childbirth. For the purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity requirement. t.     For an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates: (1)   That the differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity or quality of production; (2)   That the factor or factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class; (3)   That each of the factors is applied reasonably; (4)   That one or more of the factors account for the entire wage differential; and (5)   That the factors are job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Comparisons of wage rates shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. For the purposes of this subsection, "member of a protected class" means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or liability for service in the armed forces, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or requiring to retire from employment or discriminating against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment.

[This act] P.L.2006, c.53 (C.34:19-9 et seq.) shall not be construed as prohibiting an employer from permitting its employees or interns to voluntarily attend employer-sponsored meetings or providing other communications to the employees or interns, if the employer notifies the employees or interns that they may refuse to attend the meetings or accept the communications without penalty.

(cf: P.L.2006, c.53, s.3) 20.  Section 4 of P.L.2006, c.53 (C.34:19-12) is amended to read as follows: 4.    No employer or employer's agent, representative or designee shall discharge, discipline or otherwise penalize or threaten to discharge, discipline or otherwise penalize any employee or intern because the employee or intern, or a person acting on behalf of the employee or intern, makes a good faith report, verbally or in writing, of a violation or suspected violation of [this act] P.L.2006, c.53 (C.34:19-9 et seq.).

(cf: P.L.2006, c.53, s.5) 22.  Section 6 of P.L.2006, c.53 (C.34:19-14) is amended to read as follows: 6.    Nothing in [this act] P.L.2006, c.53 (C.34:19-9 et seq.) shall be construed to limit an employee's or interns right to bring a common law tort cause of action against an employer, including an action for wrongful termination, or to diminish or impair the rights of a person under any collective bargaining agreement. (cf: P.L.2006, c.53, s.6) 23.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment, and apply to any violation against an intern occurring on or after the effective date. STATEMENT The bill designated the New Jersey Intern Protection Act, provides legal protections and remedies for persons engaged in internships with employers.  It does so by adding interns to the provisions of the Law Against Discrimination, P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, P.L.1986, c.105 (C.34:19-1 et seq.), and P.L.2006, c.53 (C.34:19-9 et seq.), sometimes referred to as the Worker Freedom From Employer Intimidation Act. Under all three enactments, an intern would be defined as an individual who performs services for an employer on a temporary basis whose work: (1) Provides training or supplements training given in an educational environment such that the employability of the individual performing the work may be enhanced; (2) Provides experience for the benefit of the individual performing the work; and (3)  Is performed under the supervision of existing staff.  The term intern includes individuals without regard to whether the employer pays them a salary or wage. An intern would not only have recognized and enforceable legal protections from various forms of employer discrimination, retaliatory acts, and intimidation relative to religious and political matters in the workplace, the State would also have the authority, under the Law Against Discrimination, P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), to bring actions against employers.  In addition, nothing within the provisions of this bill or the various past legislative acts amended by this bill would prevent an intern from seeking protections or receiving remedies pursuant to any applicable federal law, other State law, or the common law.
