c.169 (C.10:5-3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    The Legislature finds
and declares that practices of discrimination against any of its inhabitants,
because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, gender
identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, marital status,
familial status, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United
States, disability or nationality, are matters of concern to the government of
the State, and that such discrimination threatens not only the rights and
proper privileges of the inhabitants of the State but menaces the institutions
and foundation of a free democratic State; provided, however, that nothing in
this expression of policy prevents the making of legitimate distinctions
between citizens and aliens when required by federal law or otherwise necessary
to promote the national interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further
declares its opposition to such practices of discrimination when directed
against any person by reason of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>race, creed, color, national
origin, ancestry, age, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or
sexual orientation, marital status, liability for service in the Armed Forces
of the United States, disability or nationality of that person or that person's
family members, partners, members, stockholders, directors, officers, managers,
superintendents, agents, employees, <u>interns,</u> business associates,
suppliers, or customers, in order that the economic prosperity and general
welfare of the inhabitants of the State may be protected and ensured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
that because of discrimination, people suffer personal hardships, and the State
suffers a grievous harm.  The personal hardships include: economic loss; time
loss; physical and emotional stress; and in some cases severe emotional trauma,
illness, homelessness or other irreparable harm resulting from the strain of
employment <u>or employer internship</u> controversies; relocation, search and
moving difficulties; anxiety caused by lack of information, uncertainty, and
resultant planning difficulty; career, education, family and social disruption;
and adjustment problems, which particularly impact on those protected by this
act.  Such harms have, under the common law, given rise to legal remedies,
including compensatory and punitive damages.  The Legislature intends that such
damages be available to all persons protected by this act and that this act
shall be liberally construed in combination with other protections available
under the laws of this State.</p>

but not limited to the observance of any particular day or days or any portion
thereof as a Sabbath or other holy day in accordance with the requirements of
the religion or religious belief, unless, after engaging in a bona fide effort,
the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate the

hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall not be entitled to premium
wages or premium benefits for work performed during hours to which those

would cause an employer to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required
to remain at his place of employment <u>or internship</u> during any day or
days or portion thereof that, as a requirement of his religion, he observes as
his Sabbath or other holy day, including a reasonable time prior and subsequent
thereto for travel between his place of employment <u>or internship</u> and his
home; provided that any such absence from work shall, wherever practicable in
the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by an equivalent amount of
time and work at some other mutually convenient time, or shall<u>, if
applicable,</u> be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other

retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to
another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer.</p>

multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or
administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation
more difficult or expensive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   An accommodation shall
be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the
inability of an employee <u>or intern</u> to perform the essential functions of
the position in which he or she is employed <u>or engaged as an intern</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   (i)  The provisions of

or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective
employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective
employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to require an employee <u>or intern</u> to
disclose such information about the employee <u>or intern</u> herself to any
other employee or former employee<u>, or intern or former intern,</u> of the
employer or to any authorized representative <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>of

treat, for employment-related <u>or internship-related</u> purposes, a woman
employee <u>or intern</u> that the employer knows, or should know, is affected
by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of
other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their
ability or inability to work.  In addition, an employer of an employee <u>or
intern</u> who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make available to the
employee <u>or intern</u> reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as
bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance
with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary
transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the
pregnancy when the employee <u>or intern</u>, based on the advice of her
physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of a employee breast
feeding her infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time
each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy,
other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee
to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that
providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business
operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way penalize the
employee <u>or intern</u> in terms, conditions or privileges of employment <u>or
internship</u> for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace
accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave
provided to an employee <u>or intern</u> affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding
shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave
provided to other employees <u>or interns</u> not affected by pregnancy or
breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  This
subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any
employee's <u>or interns</u> rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in
connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
section &quot;pregnancy or breastfeeding&quot; means pregnancy, childbirth, and
breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions
related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from
childbirth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship
on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered
include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number
of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of
the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the employer's
workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into
consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside
funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an
essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business
necessity requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     t.     For an employer to pay
any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of
compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the
employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for
substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and
responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation
of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in
order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of
compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made
pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   That the differential is
based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the
characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education
or experience, or the quantity or quality of production;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   That the factor or
factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation
based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   That each of the factors
is applied reasonably;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   That one or more of the
factors account for the entire wage differential; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   That the factors are
job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate
business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it
is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve
the same business purpose without producing the wage differential.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Comparisons of wage rates
shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. 
For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;member of a protected class&quot;

color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union
status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic
