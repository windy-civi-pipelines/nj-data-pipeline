The bill also enables affordable housing programs and projects in a municipality to: (1)  receive funding from the State Affordable Housing Trust Fund by submitting a written statement in support of the program from the municipal clerk, instead of having to submit a written statement in support of the program or project from the municipal governing body; and (2)  be processed by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA) by submitting a written statement from the municipal clerk stating that there is a need for such a housing project in the municipality, instead of requiring a resolution stating such a need by the governing body of the municipality. Finally, the bill would make technical changes and would take effect immediately.
