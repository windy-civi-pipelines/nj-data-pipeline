<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section)  A municipal
governing body may, by ordinance, delegate to its municipal clerk the authority
to provide, on the governing bodys behalf, a written statement in support of
one or more affordable housing programs or projects, or indicating a need for
the programs or projects in the municipality, in order to satisfy any other
provision of statute or regulation, including but not limited to subsection a.
of section 20 of P.L.1985, c.222 <br>
(C.52:27D-320) and subsection c. of section 6 of P.L.1983, c.530 <br>
(C.55:14K-6), provided that the proposed affordable housing program or project
conforms to the provisions of a municipal fair share plan and housing element
that has been approved through a judgment of repose or compliance, or through
another form of judicial or State-level administrative certification.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  Section 20 of P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-320) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     20.  There is established in
the Department of Community Affairs a separate trust fund, to be used for the
exclusive purposes as provided in this section, and which shall be known as the
&quot;New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund.&quot;  The fund shall be a
non-lapsing, revolving trust fund, and all monies deposited or received for
purposes of the fund shall be accounted for separately, by source and amount,
and remain in the fund until appropriated for such purposes.  The fund shall be
the repository of all State funds appropriated for affordable housing purposes,
including, but not limited to, the proceeds from the receipts of the additional
fee collected pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 3 of
P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-7), proceeds from available receipts of the Statewide
non-residential development fees collected pursuant to section 35 of P.L.2008,
c.46 (C.40:55D-8.4), monies lapsing or reverting from municipal development
trust funds, or other monies as may be dedicated, earmarked, or appropriated by
the Legislature for the purposes of the fund.  All references in any law,
order, rule, regulation, contract, loan, document, or otherwise, to the
&quot;Neighborhood Preservation Nonlapsing Revolving Fund&quot; shall mean the
&quot;New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund.&quot;  The department shall be
permitted to utilize annually up to 7.5 percent of the monies available in the
fund for the payment of any necessary administrative costs related to the
administration of the &quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222
(C.52:27D-301 et al.), or any costs related to administration of P.L.2008, c.46

permitted pursuant to subsection g. of this section, and by section 41 of
P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-320.1), the commissioner shall award grants or loans
from this fund for housing projects and programs in municipalities whose
housing elements have received substantive certification from the council, in
municipalities receiving State aid pursuant to P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178 et
seq.), in municipalities subject to a builder's remedy as defined in section 28
of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-328), or in receiving municipalities in cases
where the council has approved a regional contribution agreement and a project
plan developed by the receiving municipality.</p>

deposited into the &quot;New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund&quot; that
are derived from municipal development fee trust funds, or from available

funding shall be established for projects in municipalities that have
petitioned the council for substantive certification.</p>

projects in any municipality shall be funded only after receipt by the
commissioner of <u>either:</u></p>

statement in support of the program or project from the municipal governing

application procedures, and the criteria for awarding grants and loans and the
standards for establishing the amount, terms, and conditions of each grant or

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  For any period which the
council may approve, the commissioner may assist affordable housing programs
which are not located in municipalities whose housing elements have been
granted substantive certification or which are not in furtherance of a regional

all or part of a municipal low and moderate income housing obligation.</p>

applied for the following purposes in designated neighborhoods:</p>
