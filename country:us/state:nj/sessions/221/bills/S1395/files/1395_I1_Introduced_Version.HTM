units.  After the first 90 days of the initial 120-day marketing period, if any
of those units subject to the preference remain available, then applicants from
the general public shall be considered for occupancy.  Following the initial
120-day marketing period, previously qualified applicants and future qualified
applicants who are veterans who served in time of war or other emergency, as
referenced in this subsection, shall be placed on a special waiting list as

shall be given preference for affordable units, as the units become available,
whenever the percentage of preference-occupied units falls below the agreed
upon percentage.  Any agreement to provide affordable housing preferences for
veterans pursuant to this subsection shall not affect a municipality's ability
to receive credit for the unit from the council, or its successor.</p>
