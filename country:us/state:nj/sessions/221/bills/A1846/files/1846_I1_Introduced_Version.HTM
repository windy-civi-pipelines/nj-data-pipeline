<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require the
Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of Environmental
Protection and the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, to establish the
New Jersey Healthy Soils Program.  The purpose of the New Jersey Healthy Soils
Program is to:  improve the health, yield, and profitability of the States
soils; increase biological activity and carbon sequestration in the soils of
the State by promoting practices based on emerging soil science, including
planting mixed cover crops, adopting no-till or low-till farming practices, and
rotation grazing; and promote widespread use of healthy soils practices among
farmers and other persons throughout the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To carry out the purposes of
the program, the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department
of Environmental Protection and the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station,
would be required to:  provide incentives, including research, education,
technical assistance, and, subject to available funding, financial assistance
to farmers to implement farm management practices that contribute to healthy
soils within the State; provide incentives, technical assistance, and education
to persons in the State to maintain and promote healthy soils; and determine
whether the program may be implemented in a manner to enhance other State and
federal programs that provide financial assistance to farmers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the Department
of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of Environmental
Protection, would be required to establish soil management guidelines for how
to maintain and promote healthy soils within the State.  The guidelines would
be required to include, at a minimum, best practices to improve soil health in
agriculture, including urban agriculture, and in residential landscaping for
homeowners.  The guidelines, along with information concerning the New Jersey
Healthy Soils Program, would be required to be published on the Department of
Agriculture and the Department of Environmental Protections Internet websites
and updated annually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines healthy
soils as soil with the continuing capacity to function as a biological system,
increase soil organic matter, improve soil structure and water nutrient holding
capacity, and sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Healthy
soil is necessary to provide clean air and water, bountiful crops and forests,
productive grazing lands, diverse wildlife, and beautiful landscapes, and
proper soil management is essential for soil to perform optimally.  The New
Jersey Healthy Soils Program would educate farmers and residents throughout the
State on best soil management practices while providing farmers and other
persons with research, resources, and education to implement best management
practices to improve soil health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines urban
agriculture as city and suburban agriculture including, but not limited to,
backyard, roof-top and balcony gardening, community gardening in vacant lots and
parks, and roadside urban fringe agriculture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would also require a
grant program to be established within Department of Agriculture with
consultation from the Department of Environmental Protection.  The grant
program would pay for the costs of soil testing for eligible farmers who grow
food products on urban agriculture sites.  The soil testing provided, pursuant
to the grant program, would be required to include, at a minimum:  pH,
percentage of organic matter, nutrients, micronutrients, petroleum products and
petroleum hydrocarbons, and metals including lead, arsenic, cadmium, and
nickel.  In establishing the grant program, the Department of Agriculture, in
consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, would be required
to do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  establish eligibility
criteria for farmers working on urban agriculture sites;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  establish guidelines and
procedures for the submission of grant applications, and criteria for the
evaluation of such applications;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  establish soil testing
protocols and the amount of a grant to be awarded to each applicant; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  publicize on its Internet
website the application procedures and awarding of grants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Department of Agriculture,
in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, would be
required to <span style='color:black'>submit a report to the Governor and the
Legislature, during each year in which a grant is awarded, on the effectiveness
of the grant program in providing soil testing on urban agriculture sites and
improving the soil health of those urban agriculture sites.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     Due
to possible past uses of urban agriculture sites, soil testing is important to
learn as much as possible about any contaminants, such as unsafe levels of lead
or other heavy metals that may be present in the soil of urban agriculture
sites.  Elevated levels of lead in particular are fairly common in urban soils,
and pose health risks, especially to young children who can ingest soil while
playing or helping in gardens.  Other contaminants are possible, especially if
the urban agriculture site has any industrial or manufacturing history.  In
order to reduce soil contamination and improve soil health within urban
agriculture sites, soil testing is necessary.  This bill would improve access
to soil testing for eligible farmers who grow food on urban agriculture sites
and provide grants to pay for the costs of the soil testing required.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     The
bill also would establish the Urban Agriculture Site Soil Testing Fund. 
Moneys in the fund would be dedicated to providing grants to eligible farmers
for the purposes of paying the costs of soil testing on urban agriculture sites
and paying the costs of the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the
Department of Environmental Protection, to develop, implement, and administer
the grant program.  The Urban Agriculture Site Soil Testing Fund would be
credited with funding in the Global Warming Solutions Fund (GWSF).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     In
addition, the bill </span>would decrease the percentage of moneys provided in
the GWSF <span style='color:black'>to the New Jersey Economic Development
Authority to provide grants and other forms of financial assistance to
commercial, institutional, and industrial entities to support end-use energy
efficiency projects and new, efficient electric generation facilities from 60
percent to 58 percent and provide two percent of the moneys in the GWSF to the
Department of Agriculture to support programs that improve soil health within
the State and provide opportunities to increase carbon sequestration in soils.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     Finally,
New Jersey, as the most densely populated state in the nation, is highly
urbanized and suburbanized with limited opportunities to use its smaller pockets
of open space for agriculture and horticulture.  Improving soil testing within
urban agriculture sites will allow for those areas to operate effectively and
help support the Vision 2025 plan developed by the New Jersey Agricultural
Experiment Station at Rutgers, the State University.  The New Jersey
Agricultural Experiment Stations Vision 2025 plan is a system of responsive,
innovative, and inclusive programs, farms, stations, and centers that is
prioritizing investments in infrastructure, information technology, and
equipment designed to enable the expansion and development of cutting-edge
programs to support the future of agriculture by engaging with urban and
suburban communities, supporting farmers, and assisting with climate resilience
and adaptation strategies in agriculture.  The New Jersey Agricultural
Experiment Station programs, farms, stations, and centers are designed to be
national models for research, education, and outreach programs that can address
grand challenges of the State and broader society, as well as being known for
the sustainable management of the land and natural resources these efforts
encompass.</span>  </p>
