<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill's provisions,
the Commissioner of Transportation, in consultation with the Commissioner of
Education, will develop three definitions of &quot;hazardous route&quot; for
the purposes of this transportation requirement.  The definitions will
differentiate between urban, suburban, and rural routes.  In developing the
definitions, the commissioners will consider the following criteria: population
density; traffic volume; average vehicle velocity; existence or absence of
sufficient sidewalk space; roads and highways that are winding or have blind curves;
roads and highways with steep inclines and declines; drop-offs that are in
close proximity to a sidewalk; bridges or overpasses that must be crossed to
reach the school; train tracks or trestles that must be crossed to reach
school; and busy roads or highways that must be crossed to reach school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Commissioner of
Transportation, in consultation with the local police department, will
designate hazardous routes in the State using the established definitions. The
Commissioner of Transportation will then notify the Commissioner of Education
of the designated routes.  The Commissioner of Transportation will also conduct
an annual review to determine whether the designated routes continue to need
the hazardous designation, and will notify the Commissioner of Education if a
determination is made to discontinue a hazardous route designation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that when the Commissioner of Transportation determines discretionary aid from
the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund, he must give highest priority to
projects intended to remedy conditions on the designated hazardous routes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends and repeals
sections of a prior law which had authorized school districts to adopt a list
of hazardous routes in the district requiring courtesy busing services. </p>
