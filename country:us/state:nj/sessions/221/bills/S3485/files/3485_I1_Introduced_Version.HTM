establishes similar requirements for institutions of higher education.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law requires all
employers in the State to report certain employee information of all hires to
the Department of Human Services.  This bill requires that the information be
shared with any </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>school district, charter school,
nonpublic school, contracted service provider, or institution of higher
education conducting an employment verification pursuant to the bills
provisions.  Under the bill, these hiring entities are required to verify the
employment history listed by an applicant using the records available through
the Department of Human Services.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a school
district, charter school, nonpublic school, or contracted service provider that
contracts with a district or school to utilize the standardized employment
history forms developed by the Department of Education.  The bill also requires
these entities to utilize any other standardized forms developed by the
department required to carry out the provisions of the Safer Students Act.  
Similarly, the bill requires the Secretary of Higher Education to develop forms
for applicants and employers that are to be used to comply with the requirements
of this bill, as well as any other forms necessary to carry out the provisions
of this bill.  The bill also requires these hiring entities to maintain their
hiring records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that if an
applicant applying for employment with a public or nonpublic school willfully
provides false information or willfully fails to disclose information on an
application the applicant is to be subject to discipline up to, and including,
termination or denial of employment, as deemed appropriate by the department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits the
governing body of an institution of higher education from employing a person
serving in a position which involves regular contact with students unless the
institution conducts a review of the applicants employment history by
obtaining from former and current employers information regarding child abuse
and sexual misconduct allegations.  The applicant is required to list employers
from the prior 20 years that were institutions of higher education, schools, or
places where the employment involved direct contact with children.  The
institution is required to ask those employers for certain information related
to any potential allegations made or disciplinary or licensure actions taken
against the applicant.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>The applicant is required to also
provide a written statement disclosing any of the same matters. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
governing body of an institution of higher education may not enter into a
collectively bargained or negotiated agreement, an employment contract, an
agreement for resignation or termination, a severance agreement, or any other
contract or agreement or take any action that impacts the ability to report or
investigate suspected child abuse or sexual misconduct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpMiddle style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides
that an applicant to an institution of higher education who gives false
information or willfully fails to disclose required information will be subject
to discipline, including termination or denial of employment.  The applicant

Auditor may audit the hiring records of a school district, charter school,
nonpublic school, contracted service provider holding a contract with a
district or school, or institution of higher education to ensure compliance
with the provisions of the Safer Students Act.  The State Auditor is directed
to annually conduct a total of 30 randomly selected audits of school districts,
charter schools, nonpublic schools, and contracted service providers and three
randomly selected audits of institutions of higher education.  Additionally,
the State Auditor may immediately conduct an audit of the hiring practices of
an entity that is reported to be not in compliance with the provisions of the
Safer Students Act.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
Secretary of Higher Education to establish a public awareness campaign to
publicize the provisions of the bill and to ensure applicants and employers are
aware of their respective rights and responsibilities under the bill.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
department and the secretary to establish a procedure for the prompt
investigation of allegations of child abuse or sexual misconduct by a school
employee and employees of an institution of higher education. The bill includes
numerous requirements for this procedure and requires school districts, charter
schools, nonpublic schools, and institutions of higher education to utilize the
procedure established by the bill for any investigation regarding an allegation
of child abuse or sexual misconduct by an employee.   The bill further
prohibits school districts, charter schools, and nonpublic schools from
entering into contracts with contracted services providers unless the provider
attests that it utilizes comparable investigation procedures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
requires the department and secretary to provide training, free of charge, to
all designated employees.  A designated employee is required to complete the
training prior to conducting an investigation of an allegation of child abuse
or sexual misconduct by an employee, and annually thereafter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The department and secretary
are also required to establish guidelines to assist school districts, charter
schools, nonpublic schools, and institutions of higher education in
implementing the investigation procedure and for determining when to refer an
allegation of child abuse or sexual misconduct to law enforcement.  The bill
clarifies that this investigation procedure is not to be construed to supersede
requirements under current law for the reporting of child abuse by school
employees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
superintendent or chief school administrator of each school district, charter
school, and nonpublic school to designate a compliance specialist, who shall
ensure compliance of the district or school with the bills provisions.  A
contracted service provider is to identify in its contract with a district or
school the employee responsible for ensuring compliance with the provisions of
the Safer Students Act. The bill also requires designation of a compliance
specialist by an institution of higher education for the same purpose.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
Commissioner of Education to establish a range of penalties to be imposed on a
school district, charter school, nonpublic school, or contracted service
provider, for noncompliance with the Safer Students Act including fines and,
as applicable, the withholding of all or part of the districts State aid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>In addition, the commissioner is to
establish a range of penalties to be imposed on the compliance specialist of a
school district, charter school, or nonpublic school, or any other employee of
a school district, charter school, nonpublic school, or contracted service
provider, for noncompliance with the Safer Students Act  including fines, modification
or termination of employment, and suspension or revocation of the employees
license or certification.  Finally, the bill directs the commissioner to
publish on its Internet website a list of all school districts, charter
schools, nonpublic schools, and contracted service providers with one or more
incidents of noncompliance with the Safer Students Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Similarly, the bill directs
the Secretary of Higher Education to establish a range of penalties to be
imposed on an institution of higher education or persons employed at the
institution, for noncompliance with the Safer Students Act including fines
and withholding or reduction of State appropriation for operations.  The
secretary is to also establish a range of penalties to be imposed on a designee
or employee of the institution, for noncompliance with the Safer Students Act
including, but not limited to, fines, modification or termination of
employment, or other disciplinary action.  The secretary is to publish on its

recommendations of the New Jersey State Commission of Investigations March
2024 report, Safeguarding New Jersey Students from Sexual Predators and Child
Abuse at School  Examining the States Pass the Trash Law. </p>

<p class=FronterPageNOCAPS style='margin-left:0in;line-height:150%'>     The
sponsor of this bill intends to strengthen the laws currently in place that
require school districts, charter schools, nonpublic schools, and contracted
service providers to review the employment history of prospective employees for
allegations of child abuse or sexual misconduct. Additionally, the sponsor
intends to extend the same protections from sexual predators offered to
students enrolled in kindergarten through grade 12 by current law to college
and graduate students, whose positions of vulnerability in the academic setting
also can be exploited by predatory members of faculties, athletic departments,
and administrations.   </p>
