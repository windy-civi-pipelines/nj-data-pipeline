CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Joint Resolution designating the fourth Sunday of October of each year as Football Tight Ends Day in New Jersey. Whereas, In the game of football, the positions of quarterback, running back, and wide receiver are widely considered to be among the most important and exciting; and Whereas, One of the most overlooked positions, however, is the tight end position, a hybrid position with the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a wide receiver; and Whereas, Tight ends are expected to be strong enough to block defensive linemen while also possessing the necessary skill and athleticism to warrant a defenses attention as a pass catcher; and Whereas, Despite the multiple skillsets tight ends possess, they are often undervalued by teams and fans throughout the National Football League (NFL); and Whereas, Tight ends are known throughout the NFL for their energy, outgoing personalities, and overall fun nature towards the game of football; and Whereas, To celebrate and acknowledge tight ends throughout the NFL, San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle, widely considered to be among the best players in the NFL, created National Tight Ends Day in 2019; and Whereas, Since 2019, National Tight Ends Day has been celebrated on the fourth Sunday of October of each year to recognize tight ends and their selfless, hard work that is instrumental to the success of their teams; and Whereas, As the birthplace of college football, home of the New York Giants and New York Jets, as well as of fans of the Philadelphia Eagles, New Jersey has a unique legacy with the game of football, at all levels of competition; and Whereas, In addition to the States football legacy, New Jersey has been the home of numerous talented tight ends, including former NFL tight end Greg Olsen, current NFL tight ends Mike Gesicki, Eric Ebron, and Anthony Firkser, and United States Senator Cory Booker, who was a standout tight end in high school and at Stanford University; and Whereas, Therefore, it is fitting and proper for New Jersey to take the lead on promoting football tight ends, given its storied history with the game and the position, and designate the fourth Sunday of October of each year as Football Tight Ends Day to recognize the contributions and efforts of those players; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The fourth Sunday of October of each year is designated as Football Tight Ends Day in the State of New Jersey to recognize the exceptional efforts, talent, and often overlooked contributions of football tight ends and the historical significance of football and the tight end position in the State. 2.    The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation designating the fourth Sunday of October of each year as Football Tight Ends Day and shall call upon the public officials and citizens of this State to observe the day with appropriate activities and programs. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution designates the fourth Sunday of October of each year as Football Tight Ends Day in New Jersey. Tight ends (TEs) are hybrid position players on offense who have several responsibilities.  During a rushing play, they are tasked with effectively blocking defensive linemen, who often range anywhere from 275 and 325 pounds.  During a passing play, they are required to block linemen, run a receiving route, or both.  The various responsibilities of a TE require them to be strong, agile, decisive, and athletic. Despite these various responsibilities and skillsets, TEs are often overlooked when it comes to fan appreciation and recognition for more glamorous positions, such as quarterback or running back.  To provide greater recognition to TEs, San Francisco 49ers TE George Kittle, widely considered one of the best players in the NFL by fans and players alike, created National Tight Ends Day in 2019.  The focus of National Tight Ends Day is to acknowledge the importance of the TE position, the often undervalued TEs in the league, and celebrate the energetic and fun personalities of TEs.  Since its inception in 2019, National Tight Ends Day has been embraced by teams, the NFL, fans, and multiple media outlets across the country. New Jersey has a rich history in the game of football.  New Jersey is the birthplace of college football and home to both the New York Giants and New York Jets, who play their games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford.  New Jersey has a rich history with the tight end position as well.  The Miami Dolphins Mike Gesicki, Pittsburgh Steelers Eric Ebron, and Tennessee Titans Anthony Firkser were all born in New Jersey and play the TE position at a high level in the NFL.  Former All-Pro TE and current sportscaster Greg Olsen was also born in New Jersey and was a highly recruited player out of Wayne Hills High School.  United States Senator Cory Booker was also a standout TE at Northern Valley Regional High School at Old Tappan and Stanford University. Given the States storied history with the game of football and the tight end position, it is appropriate for New Jersey to take the lead on promoting and acknowledging Football Tight Ends Day on the fourth Sunday of October of each year to recognize the contributions and efforts of those players.
