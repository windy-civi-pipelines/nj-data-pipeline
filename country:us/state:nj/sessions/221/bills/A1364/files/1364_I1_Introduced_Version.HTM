Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      1.</span>
 <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>This act shall be known and may be cited as
Billy Crays Law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      2.   The
Legislature finds and declares the following:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      a.   Individuals
with developmental disabilities are particularly vulnerable to abuse, neglect,
and exploitation by caregivers, guardians, and other persons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      b.   Group
homes and supervised apartments for individuals with developmental</span><b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif;letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></b><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>disabilities admirably enable these individuals to
live more independently within a non-institutional setting; however, the lack
of institutional controls and oversight at these homes ultimately makes it more
difficult for the State, for individual group home and supervised apartment operators,
and for concerned family members to promptly identify and respond to wrongdoing
that may be committed by caregivers, guardians, staff, and other persons at the
home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      c.   The
safety and quality of life of individuals with developmental disabilities who
receive care from group homes and supervised apartments is of paramount
concern, and the use of electronic monitoring is a reasonable means by which
the State and concerned family members can better ensure the prevention of, and
the institution of a more proactive response to, the abuse, neglect, and
exploitation of group home and supervised apartment residents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      d.   The
use of video surveillance in group homes and supervised apartments will enable
consenting residents and their authorized representatives to more proactively
and effectively review and ensure the propriety of care that is being provided
to such residents and will further enable the State, licensed service
providers, and whistleblowers to more easily verify, and obtain evidence to
substantiate or refute, allegations of abuse, neglect, and exploitation
occurring in group homes and supervised apartments.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      e.   The
State recognizes that each individual with developmental disabilities is unique
and has differing needs and preferences, and that, while some residents and
their authorized representatives may consent to the use of video surveillance
to better ensure the residents safety, others may refuse to consent to such
video surveillance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      f.    Through
the enactment of this act, it is the intent of the Legislature to make
electronic monitoring technology more readily available in group home and
supervised apartment settings, while taking great care to strike the important
and delicate balance between </span><br clear=all style='page-break-before:
always'>
<span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>protecting the privacy rights and protecting
the overall well-being of these residents.  By increasing the availability of
electronic monitoring technology in group homes and supervised apartments, the
Legislature intends to:  (1) make it easier for residents and their authorized
representatives to monitor residents care, if they so choose; (2) make it
easier for concerned family members and whistleblowers to file and substantiate
complaints of abuse, neglect, exploitation, or other improper care or treatment
involving group home and supervised apartment residents; and (3) improve the
ability of the State and of individual licensees to verify and appropriately
respond to such complaints. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      g.   By
enabling group home and supervised apartment residents with developmental
disabilities and their authorized representatives to use electronic monitoring
to protect against, provide documentary evidence of, and ensure a prompt and
adequate response to, any abuse, neglect, and exploitation occurring in the
group home or supervised apartment, the Legislature can further preserve the
rights and safety of group home and supervised apartment residents.    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      h.   This
act is dedicated to William Billy Cray, a 33-year-old with developmental
disabilities who, on a Sunday morning in</span><b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'> </span></b>August<span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'> 2017, was inexplicably found dead in a Somers Point group home, operated
by Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health New Jersey, where he resided.  Billy
Cray, who had suffered from institutional abuse since he was a child, was the
son of Martha Cray, a dedicated and long-time advocate for persons with
developmental disabilities.  For many years, both preceding and following her
sons death, Martha Cray, and Aileen Rivera of Wayne, New Jersey, whose son was
badly beaten by a staffer at the North Jersey Development Center in Totowa,
have continued to work tirelessly to advance legislation protecting the rights
and safety of individuals with developmental disabilities, particularly those
residing in group homes.  Martha Cray and Aileen Rivera were particularly
instrumental in facilitating the passage of Stephen Komninos Law, P.L.2017,
c.238 (C.30:6D-9.1), which provides for the heightened scrutiny of group homes
