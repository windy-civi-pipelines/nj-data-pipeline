authorities, and counties and municipalities, and their agencies and
instrumentalities, and boards of education, and fire districts, are prohibited
from engaging in a transaction or entering into a contract having an
anticipated value in excess of $17,500 with a business entity, unless the contract
is awarded pursuant to a fair and open process, if, during the preceding
one-year period, that business entity has made a campaign contribution
reportable to the Election Law Enforcement Commission (ELEC) to any candidate
committee of any person serving in an elective public office in the applicable jurisdiction
where the contract is awarded.  Likewise, a business entity that has engaged in

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill directs ELEC to adjust
the applicable monetary threshold by December 1 of each year to be equivalent

municipalities, and school districts to be awarded by a qualified purchasing
agent.  The current adjusted public bidding threshold is $44,000, and it is
adjusted every five years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the adjusted
transaction and contract value thresholds will be applicable to the State and

authorities, and to any county or municipality, or agency or instrumentality
thereof, or board of education, or fire district, which has designated a
purchasing agent for purposes of engaging in transactions or entering into
contracts below the value threshold.  Any county or municipality, or agency or
instrumentality thereof, or board of education, or fire district without a
qualified purchasing agent will continue to be subject to the applicable
transaction or contract value provided by law, without adjustment, which is
currently $17,500.</p>
