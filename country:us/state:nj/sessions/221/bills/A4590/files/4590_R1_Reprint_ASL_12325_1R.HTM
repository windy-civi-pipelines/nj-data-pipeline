<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  N.J.S.18A:66-13 is amended
to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     18A:66-13.  Prior service
credit. A member may file a detailed statement of:  a. school service and
service in a similar capacity in other states and in schools within and outside
the United States operated by a department of the United States Government for
the instruction of the children of United States Government officers and
employees, or b. other public employment in other states or with the United
States Government which would be eligible for credit in a State-administered
retirement system if the employment was with a public employer in this State,
or c. military service in the Armed Forces of the United States, <u>including
any period of enrollment in a military service academy,</u> rendered prior to
becoming a member, for which the member desires credit, and of such other facts
as the retirement system may require. The member may purchase credit for all or
a portion of the service evidenced in the statement up to the nearest number of
years and months, but not exceeding 10 years, provided however, that a member
purchasing that maximum credit may purchase up to five additional years for
additional military service qualifying the member as a veteran as defined in
N.J.S.18A:66-2.  No application shall be accepted for the purchase of credit
for such service if, at the time of application, the member has a vested right
to retirement benefits in another retirement system based in whole or in part
upon that service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The member may purchase credit
for the service by paying into the annuity savings fund the amount required by
applying the factor, supplied by the actuary as being applicable to the
member's age at the time of the purchase, to the member's salary at that time,
or to the highest annual compensation for service in this State for which
contributions were made during any prior fiscal year of membership, whichever
is greater.  The purchase may be made in regular installments, equal to at
least one-half the full normal contribution to the retirement system, over a
maximum period of 10 years.  Neither the State nor the employer of a member who
applies to purchase credit for public employment with the United States
Government pursuant to subsection b. of this section or for military service
pursuant to subsection c. of this section shall be liable for any payment to
the retirement system on behalf of the member for the purchase of this credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any provision
of this act to the contrary, a member shall not be liable for any costs
associated with the financing of pension adjustment benefits and health care
benefits for retirees when purchasing credit for school service, public
employment in other states or with the United States Government, or military
service in the Armed Forces of the United States<u>, including any period of
enrollment in a military service academy</u>.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any member electing to
purchase the service who retires prior to completing payments as agreed with
the retirement system will receive pro rata credit for service purchased prior
to the date of retirement, but if the member so elects at the time of
retirement, the member may make the additional lump sum payment required at
that time to provide full credit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of law to the contrary, service credit established in the retirement
system by a member through purchase in accordance with this section, which
purchase was made by an application submitted on or after the effective date of
P.L.2008, c.89, except a purchase for military service in the Armed Forces of
the United States, <u>including any period of enrollment in a  military service
academy,</u> shall not be eligible for consideration when service is used to
determine the qualification of the member for any health care benefits coverage
paid, in whole or in part, by a public employer after the member's retirement. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>As used in this section,
military service academy means the United States Military Academy, the United
State Naval Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States
Coast Guard Academy.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  Section 2 of P.L.1963,
c.19 (C.43:15A-73.1) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    A member may file a
detailed statement of public employment in other states or with the United
States Government which would be eligible for credit in a State-administered
retirement system if the employment was with a public employer in this State,
or of military service in the Armed Forces of the United States, <u>including
any period of enrollment in a military service academy,</u> or of service
resulting from initial appointment or employment on or after January 1, 2002
with a bi-state or multi-state agency established pursuant to an interstate
compact to which the State is a party which would be eligible for credit in a
State-administered retirement system if the employment was with a public
employer in this State, rendered prior to becoming a member, for which the
member desires credit, and of such other facts as the retirement system may
require. The member may purchase credit for all or a portion of the service
evidenced in the statement up to the nearest number of years and months, but
not exceeding 10 years, provided however, that a member purchasing that maximum
credit may purchase up to five additional years for additional military service
qualifying the member as a veteran as defined in section 6 of P.L.1954, c.84
(C.43:15A-6).  No application shall be accepted for the purchase of credit for
the service if, at the time of application, the member has a vested right to
retirement benefits in another retirement system based in whole or in part upon
that service. The member may purchase credit for the service by paying into the
