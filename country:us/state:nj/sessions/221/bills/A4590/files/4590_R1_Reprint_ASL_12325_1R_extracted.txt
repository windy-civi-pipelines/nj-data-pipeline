Purchase of credit for service as a class two special law enforcement officer shall be permitted only if the break between service as such an officer and the date of their enrollment in the Police and Firemen's Retirement System is less than 365 days.  Members of the retirement system who are enrolled on the effective date of P.L.2024, c.54 shall have only one year from that effective date to apply for such a purchase.  The board of trustees shall notify all members of the retirement system of the provisions of this act, P.L.2024, c.54. As used in this section, military service academy means the United States Military Academy, the United States Naval Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States Coast Guard Academy.1 (cf: P.L.2024, c.54, s.1) 4.  Section 2 of P.L.2013, c.87 (C.53:5A-6.1) is amended to read as follows: 2.    A member may file a detailed statement of military service in the Armed Forces of the United States, including any period of enrollment in a military service academy, rendered prior to becoming a member, for which the member desires credit, and of such other facts as the retirement system may require. The member may purchase credit for all or a portion of the service evidenced in the statement up to the nearest number of years and months, but not exceeding 10 years, provided however, that a member purchasing that maximum credit may purchase up to five additional years for additional military service qualifying the member as a veteran as defined in section 3 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-3).  If such credit is established, it shall be considered the same as creditable service as a full-time commissioned officer, noncommissioned officer or trooper rendered as a member.  No application shall be accepted for the purchase of credit for the service if, at the time of application, the member has a vested right to retirement benefits in another retirement system based in whole or in part upon that service.  The member may purchase credit for the service by paying into the annuity savings fund the amount required by applying the factor, supplied by the actuary as being applicable to the member's age at the time of the purchase, to the member's salary at that time, or to the highest annual compensation for service in this State for which contributions were made during any prior fiscal year of membership, whichever is greater.  The purchase may be made in regular installments, equal to at least 1/2 of the full normal contribution to the retirement system, over a maximum period of 10 years. The employer of a member who applies, pursuant to this section, to purchase credit for military service in the Armed Forces of the United States, including any period of enrollment in a military service academy, shall not be liable for any payment to the retirement system on behalf of the member for the purchase of this credit.  The Adjutant General of the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs shall be responsible for determining whether any person seeking to be considered a "veteran" under section 3 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-3), for the purpose of purchasing military service credit, meets the criteria set forth therein and adjudicating an appeal from any person disputing this determination.  The determination of the Adjutant General shall be binding upon the Division of Pensions and Benefits. Notwithstanding any provision of this act to the contrary, a member shall not be liable for any costs associated with the financing of pension adjustment benefits and health care benefits for retirees when purchasing credit for military service in the Armed Forces of the United States, including any period of enrollment in a military service academy. Any member electing to make a purchase pursuant to this section who retires prior to completing payments as agreed with the retirement system will receive pro rata credit for the purchase prior to the date of retirement, but if the member so elects at the time of retirement, the member may make the additional lump sum payment required at that time to provide full credit. As used in this section, military service academy means the United States Military Academy, the United State Naval Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States Coast Guard Academy. (cf: P.L.2013, c.87, s.2) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately.
