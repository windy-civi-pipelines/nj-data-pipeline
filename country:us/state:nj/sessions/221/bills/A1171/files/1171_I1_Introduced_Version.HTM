ex officio member, the Director of the Division of Aging Services in the
Department of Human Services, and six new public members.  The bill further
revises the requirements for the ex officio membership by identifying specific
offices and divisions from which certain ex officio members are to be
appointed.  The bill also revises the requirements for the public membership,
which under current law includes a business person, a lay person born of deaf
parents, five citizens who are deaf, and five citizens who are hard of
hearing.  As revised, the public membership will include a licensed
audiologist, a licensed speech-language pathologist, an American Sign Language
instructor, an educational provider, a business person, a lay person born of
deaf parents, one parent of a child who is deaf or hard of hearing, one parent
of a child with special needs who is deaf or hard of hearing, two citizens who
are deaf-blind, four citizens who are deaf, and four citizens who are hard of
hearing.  The bill identifies certain requirements for certain of the public
members to be appointed variously by the Governor, the Senate President, and
the Speaker of the General Assembly.</p>
