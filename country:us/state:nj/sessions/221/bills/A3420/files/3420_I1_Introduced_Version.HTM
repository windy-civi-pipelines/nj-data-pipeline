<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    As used in sections 1
through 4 of this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Eligible building means a
building located in the State, which is: (1) a residential multi-family
building, with at least four habitable stories, that contains at least 10,000
square feet of interior space; (2) one or more residential multi-family

square feet of interior space, provided that, in any single phase of the
project, at least 10,000 square feet of interior space is under construction or
rehabilitation; (3) a building used for commercial or industrial purposes; or
(4) any combination of buildings described in paragraphs (1) through (3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Gold level building means a
building that meets a level of performance that is equivalent to or higher than

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  A taxpayer shall be
allowed a credit against the tax otherwise due pursuant to section 5 of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) in an amount as may be allowed pursuant to rules
and regulations adopted pursuant to subsection b. of section 3 of this act for certain
costs of construction paid by the taxpayer for the construction of an eligible
building qualifying as a silver level building, a gold level building, or a
platinum level building during the privilege period. The amount of credit
claimed in a privilege period that cannot be applied for that privilege period
due to limitations in this section may be carried over, if necessary, to the
five privilege periods following the privilege period for which the credit is
first allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The order of priority of
the application of the credit allowed under this section and any other credits
allowed by law shall be as prescribed by the Director of the Division of
Taxation.  The amount of the credit claimed for the privilege period in which
the cost is incurred shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax liability otherwise
due and shall not reduce the amount of the tax liability to less than the
statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162
(C.54:10A-5).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     To claim the credit
authorized under this section, a taxpayer shall apply to the Commissioner of
Environmental Protection for certification of credit eligibility.  The
commissioner shall certify to the Division of Taxation that the property meets
the definition of an eligible building, that the construction has been
completed in compliance with the requirements for rating as a silver, gold or
platinum level building, and the amount of the credit allowed pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to subsection b. of section 3 of this
act.  The taxpayer shall attach the certification to the tax return on which
the credit is claimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    For any privilege
period, a taxpayer may apply a credit under this section only if:  (1) the
taxpayer has obtained and filed a credit reservation certificate, as described
in section 3 of this act, and an eligibility certificate, as described in
subsection c. of this section; (2) a certificate of occupancy, for the eligible
building that is the subject of the credit, has been issued; and (3) the
eligible building remains in service and performs as a silver, gold or platinum
level building during that year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     For each taxpayer who
is eligible for a credit under this section, the Commissioner of Environmental
Protection shall grant a credit, provided that the credits, in the aggregate
and together with those granted pursuant to section 6 of this act, shall not
exceed $10,000,000; provided further that any unused allocable amounts shall
roll over to subsequent fiscal years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  Upon application by
a taxpayer, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall issue a credit
reservation certificate, where the taxpayer has made a showing that the
eligible building qualifies for the allowance of a credit under section 2 of
this act.  The certificate shall state:  (1) the earliest privilege period for
which the credit may be applied; (2) the maximum amount of the total credit
allowed and the maximum amount of credit allowed in any single privilege
period; (3) an expiration date; and (4) such other information as the
Commissioner of Environmental Protection may prescribe.  The certificate shall
apply only to the eligible building placed in service by the specified
expiration date.  Certificates may be issued in the first State fiscal year
following the date of adoption of the rules and regulations required pursuant
to subsection b. of this section and in the five State fiscal years thereafter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Within one year after
the date of enactment of this act, the Commissioner of Environmental
Protection, in consultation with the President of the Board of Public

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a
corporation business tax credit and a gross income tax credit for costs
incurred in the construction of an eligible building qualifying as a silver
level building, a gold level building, or a platinum level building under the
LEED Green Building Rating System or the LEED Residential Green Building Rating
System, as appropriate.  LEED refers to the Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design green building rating system developed and published by
the United States Green Building Council.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines eligible
building as a building located in the State, which is:  (1) a residential
multi-family building, with at least four habitable stories, that contains at
least 10,000 square feet of interior space; (2) one or more residential
multi-family buildings with at least four habitable stories that are part of a
single or phased construction project that contains, in the aggregate, at least
20,000 square feet of interior space, provided that, in any single phase of the
project, at least 10,000 square feet of interior space is under construction or
rehabilitation; (3) a building used for commercial or industrial purposes; or
(4) any combination of buildings described in (1) through (3) above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs, within one
year after the date of enactment of this bill into law, the Commissioner of
Environmental Protection in consultation with the President of the Board of
Public Utilities, to adopt rules and regulations to establish the amount of the
tax credit available to a taxpayer pursuant to this bill.  The amount of the
credit would be based on the number of square feet of floor space in the
eligible building, the overall size of the building, and the level of
certification as a silver, gold or platinum level building under the LEED Green
Building Rating System or the LEED Residential Green Building Rating System, as
appropriate.  These rules and regulations shall be developed based on the LEED
Rating System and any rules and regulations adopted by other states for similar
tax credit programs.  In addition, these rules and regulations would take into
account how construction of the eligible building impacts the local natural
environment, uses recycled or recyclable materials, incorporates renewable and
energy efficient power generation systems, uses water resources more
efficiently, and produces less waste than traditional building practices. 
These rules and regulations would also set forth requirements for determining
the continued performance of the eligible building as a silver, gold or
platinum level building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The total amount of the tax
credits available under the bill would be $10 million.  Lastly, the bill would
require the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, in consultation with the
Director of the Division of Taxation, to prepare a report regarding the number
of certificates and taxpayers applying the tax credits, the amount of the
credits granted, the geographical distribution of the credits granted, and any
other information that the commissioner or the director may deem useful or appropriate,
including an evaluation of the effectiveness of the tax credit as an incentive
for the construction of buildings in New Jersey meeting the highest level of
performance under the LEED Rating System and any recommendations for the
continuation of the tax credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Because traditional building
is one of the most resource-demanding industries in the United
  States, the use of green building practices has the potential to
significantly reduce waste and dependence on finite resources.  Green buildings
use resources-energy, water, materials, and land more efficiently and
effectively, and provide healthier environments for working, learning and
living.  Green buildings are more environmentally-friendly because the
buildings minimize the negative environmental consequences by lessening changes
to the local natural environment, using recycled or recyclable materials,
incorporating renewable and energy efficient power generation systems, using
water resources more efficiently, and producing less waste.  Green buildings
provide employees with a healthier indoor work environment by effectively
controlling outdoor air ventilation systems and using alternative paints,
finishes, adhesives, furniture and fabrics that do not negatively affect air
quality.</p>
