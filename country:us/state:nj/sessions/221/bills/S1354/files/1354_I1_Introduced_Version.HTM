<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The State of New Jersey
has a vast coastal shoreline, encompassing more than 100 miles of oceanfront
bordering the Atlantic Ocean.  Famous for its many boardwalks, the Jersey Shore
has the highest concentration of oceanside boardwalks in the United States. 
The Jersey Shore is a popular vacation spot with local and out of State
residents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Hurricane Sandy
devastated many coastal towns, spawning the demolition of entire communities
and dramatically increasing the number of derelict and abandoned boats and
vessels along the shoreline.  Many of these communities have little to no
resources to remove abandoned and derelict boats from the shoreline. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Abandoned boats obstruct
navigational channels, damage ecosystems, and diminish the recreational value
of the surrounding area.  Abandoned boats may also contain fuel and other
hazardous materials that are often difficult and expensive to remove safely,
requiring the use of specialized equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The establishment of a
working group for the safe removal of abandoned boats would help shore
communities, rejuvenating the marine and coastal regions of New Jersey. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section) a. The
Abandoned and Derelict Boat Removal working group is created and established in
the Executive Branch of the State Government.  For the purpose of complying
with the New Jersey Constitution, the working group is allocated within the
Department of Law and Public Safety. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The working group shall
consist of 21 members.  The following members shall serve ex officio: the
Commandant of the United States Coast Guard or a designee; the Administrator of
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or a designee; the
Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police or a designee; the Chief
Executive Officer of the New Jersey Department of Transportation Office of
Maritime Resources or a designee; the Chief Executive Officer of the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Coastal and Land Use
Enforcement or a designee; the President of the New Jersey Association of
Counties or a designee; the President of the New Jersey League of
Municipalities or a designee; a member of the Marine Trades Association of New
Jersey; a member of the commercial fishing industry from the State; and a
member of the recreational fishing industry from the State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The remaining 11 members shall
be public members, appointed as follows: Four public members shall be appointed
by the President of the Senate; four public members shall be appointed by the
Speaker of the General Assembly; and three public members shall be appointed by
the Governor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Each public member of
the working group shall serve for a term of three years, expiring on January 1
in the appropriate year; except that of the members first appointed, five shall
be appointed for a term of one year, and six shall be appointed for a term of
two years, as determined by the Governor.  Public members shall be eligible for
reappointment.  The public members shall serve until their successors are
appointed and qualified, and the term of the successor incumbent shall be
calculated from the expiration of the term of that incumbent.  A vacancy
occurring other than by expiration of term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment but for the unexpired term only. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The members of the
working group shall serve without compensation, but they shall be entitled to
reimbursement for all necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their
duties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The Governor shall
designate a chairperson and, as necessary any co-chairpersons from among the
working group.  The working group shall meet upon the call of the chairperson
or of a majority of the working group members.  The presence of a majority of
the authorized membership of the working group shall be required for the
conduct of official business. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The working group shall
organize as soon as practicable but not later than 14 days following the
appointment of the last member of the working group. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section) a.  It
shall be the responsibility of the working group to assist the coastal
communities of the State in the identification and safe removal of abandoned
and derelict boats. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The working group shall
report its findings and recommendations to the Governor, and the Legislature
pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), within one year of its
initial organizational meeting and by February 1st of each succeeding year for
the activities of the preceding calendar year.  The report shall be in writing
and include such recommendations as deemed appropriate by the working group to
effectuate its purposes, as provided by this section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    (New section) a.  The
Department of Law and Public Safety shall provide the staff assistance required
in order to support the work of the working group.  In addition, the working
group is authorized to call upon any department, office, division, or agency of
the State to supply such data, or other information and assistance as it deems
necessary to discharge the responsibilities of the working group. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    These departments,
offices, divisions, agencies shall, to the extent possible and not inconsistent
with any other law of this State, cooperate with the working group and shall
furnish it with such data, information, and assistance as may be necessary or
helpful to accomplish the purposes of the working group. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    (New section) a.  The
State Treasurer shall establish a program to provide reimbursement to
municipalities for the cost of removing abandoned vessels pursuant to the

will be comprised of 21 members and include ex officio members from the
federal, State, and local government as follows: the Commandant of the United
States Coast Guard or a designee; the Administrator of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration or a designee; the Superintendent of the New Jersey

to be appointed by the President of the Senate; four public members are to be
appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly; and three public members are
to be appointed by the Governor.  The bill requires the Governor to designate a
chairperson and any co-chairpersons deemed necessary by the Governor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The working groups
responsibility under this bill is to assist local communities in identifying
and safely removing abandoned and derelict boats within the State.  Within one
year of the working groups initial organizational meeting, the working group
is required to issue an interim report of its work and provide a copy to the
Governor, and the members of the Senate and General Assembly.  Thereafter,
annual reports shall be issued by February 1st of each succeeding year for the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill
establishes a fund to reimburse municipalities for the cost of removing
abandoned vessels and appropriates $25,000,000 for this purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law,
municipalities are authorized to remove abandoned vessels under certain
circumstances.  This bill requires the State Treasurer to establish a program
to provide reimbursement to municipalities for the cost of removing the
abandoned vessels.  Under the bill, a municipality may submit an application
for reimbursement in a form and manner determined by the State Treasurer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes in the
Department of the Treasury a separate, nonlapsing fund to be known as the
Abandoned Vessels Fund.  The fund is to be administered by the department and

a two-thirds majority. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also appropriates
from the General Fund to the Department of the Treasury $25,000,000 for the
provision of that amount to the Abandoned Vessels Fund for the purposes set
forth in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, it is
unlawful for an owner to abandon a vessel on public land or water or private
property without the consent of the owner, except when an emergency exists.  An
owner who violates this provision is subject to a civil penalty of not more
than $1,000.  Each day upon which the violation continues is to constitute a
separate offense.  In addition, under current law, a municipality may adopt an
ordinance, or a harbor commission may adopt a resolution, requiring every owner
or operator of a vessel that moors or docks in a municipal waterway or grounds
on land under the control of the municipality or harbor commission to register
with the appropriate official.  An owner or operator who violates the
provisions of the ordinance or resolution is subject to a civil penalty between
$100 and $1,250.  Each day upon which the violation continues constitutes a
separate offense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law provides that
these civil penalties are to paid into the treasury of the municipality in
which the violation occurred for the general uses of the municipality.  Under
this bill, these civil penalties are to be paid to the State Treasurer and
deposited into the Abandoned Vessels Fund established by the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that in order to be eligible for reimbursement under the program established by
the bill, a municipality is required to adopt an ordinance requiring an owner
or operator of a vessel that moors or docks in a municipal waterway or grounds

with the appropriate official.</p>
