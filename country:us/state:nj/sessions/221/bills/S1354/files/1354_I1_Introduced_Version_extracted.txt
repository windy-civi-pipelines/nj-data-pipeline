District 1 (Atlantic, Cape May and Cumberland) Senator  VIN GOPAL District 11 (Monmouth) SYNOPSIS Concerns removal of abandoned vessels; appropriates $25 million. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning abandoned vessels, supplementing and amending various parts of the statutory law, and making an appropriation. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The State of New Jersey has a vast coastal shoreline, encompassing more than 100 miles of oceanfront bordering the Atlantic Ocean.  Famous for its many boardwalks, the Jersey Shore has the highest concentration of oceanside boardwalks in the United States. The Jersey Shore is a popular vacation spot with local and out of State residents. b.    Hurricane Sandy devastated many coastal towns, spawning the demolition of entire communities and dramatically increasing the number of derelict and abandoned boats and vessels along the shoreline.  Many of these communities have little to no resources to remove abandoned and derelict boats from the shoreline. c.     Abandoned boats obstruct navigational channels, damage ecosystems, and diminish the recreational value of the surrounding area.  Abandoned boats may also contain fuel and other hazardous materials that are often difficult and expensive to remove safely, requiring the use of specialized equipment. d.    The establishment of a working group for the safe removal of abandoned boats would help shore communities, rejuvenating the marine and coastal regions of New Jersey. 2.    (New section) a. The Abandoned and Derelict Boat Removal working group is created and established in the Executive Branch of the State Government.  For the purpose of complying with the New Jersey Constitution, the working group is allocated within the Department of Law and Public Safety. b.    The working group shall consist of 21 members.  The following members shall serve ex officio: the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard or a designee; the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or a designee; the Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police or a designee; the Chief Executive Officer of the New Jersey Department of Transportation Office of Maritime Resources or a designee; the Chief Executive Officer of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Coastal and Land Use Enforcement or a designee; the President of the New Jersey Association of Counties or a designee; the President of the New Jersey League of Municipalities or a designee; a member of the Marine Trades Association of New Jersey; a member of the commercial fishing industry from the State; and a member of the recreational fishing industry from the State. The remaining 11 members shall be public members, appointed as follows: Four public members shall be appointed by the President of the Senate; four public members shall be appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly; and three public members shall be appointed by the Governor. c.     Each public member of the working group shall serve for a term of three years, expiring on January 1 in the appropriate year; except that of the members first appointed, five shall be appointed for a term of one year, and six shall be appointed for a term of two years, as determined by the Governor.  Public members shall be eligible for reappointment.  The public members shall serve until their successors are appointed and qualified, and the term of the successor incumbent shall be calculated from the expiration of the term of that incumbent.  A vacancy occurring other than by expiration of term shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment but for the unexpired term only. d.    The members of the working group shall serve without compensation, but they shall be entitled to reimbursement for all necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. e.     The Governor shall designate a chairperson and, as necessary any co-chairpersons from among the working group.  The working group shall meet upon the call of the chairperson or of a majority of the working group members.  The presence of a majority of the authorized membership of the working group shall be required for the conduct of official business. f.     The working group shall organize as soon as practicable but not later than 14 days following the appointment of the last member of the working group. 3.    (New section) a.  It shall be the responsibility of the working group to assist the coastal communities of the State in the identification and safe removal of abandoned and derelict boats. b.    The working group shall report its findings and recommendations to the Governor, and the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), within one year of its initial organizational meeting and by February 1st of each succeeding year for the activities of the preceding calendar year.  The report shall be in writing and include such recommendations as deemed appropriate by the working group to effectuate its purposes, as provided by this section. 4.    (New section) a.  The Department of Law and Public Safety shall provide the staff assistance required in order to support the work of the working group.  In addition, the working group is authorized to call upon any department, office, division, or agency of the State to supply such data, or other information and assistance as it deems necessary to discharge the responsibilities of the working group. b.    These departments, offices, divisions, agencies shall, to the extent possible and not inconsistent with any other law of this State, cooperate with the working group and shall furnish it with such data, information, and assistance as may be necessary or helpful to accomplish the purposes of the working group. 5.    (New section) a.  The State Treasurer shall establish a program to provide reimbursement to municipalities for the cost of removing abandoned vessels pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1975, c.369 (C.12:7C-7 et seq.).  A municipality may submit an application for reimbursement in a form and manner determined by the State Treasurer.  The State Treasurer shall implement the program within 30 days of adopting rules and regulations pursuant to subsection c. of this section.  The Abandoned Vessels Fund established pursuant to subsection b. of this section shall be used to fund the program. b.    There is established in the Department of the Treasury a separate, nonlapsing fund to be known as the Abandoned Vessels Fund.  The fund shall be administered by the department and dedicated to providing reimbursement to municipalities for the cost of removing abandoned vessels pursuant to the program established by subsection a. of this section.

STATEMENT This bill establishes the New Jersey Abandoned and Derelict Boat Removal working group, a fund to reimburse municipalities for the cost of removing abandoned vessels, and appropriates $25,000,000.

In addition, the bill establishes a fund to reimburse municipalities for the cost of removing abandoned vessels and appropriates $25,000,000 for this purpose. Under current law, municipalities are authorized to remove abandoned vessels under certain circumstances.  This bill requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide reimbursement to municipalities for the cost of removing the abandoned vessels.  Under the bill, a municipality may submit an application for reimbursement in a form and manner determined by the State Treasurer. This bill establishes in the Department of the Treasury a separate, nonlapsing fund to be known as the Abandoned Vessels Fund.  The fund is to be administered by the department and dedicated to providing reimbursement to municipalities for the cost of removing abandoned vessels pursuant to the program established by the bill.  The bill provides that the funds contained in the Abandoned Vessels Fund are not to be diverted for another purpose, unless the Legislature approves the diversion by a two-thirds majority. The bill also appropriates from the General Fund to the Department of the Treasury $25,000,000 for the provision of that amount to the Abandoned Vessels Fund for the purposes set forth in the bill. Under current law, it is unlawful for an owner to abandon a vessel on public land or water or private property without the consent of the owner, except when an emergency exists.  An owner who violates this provision is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000.  Each day upon which the violation continues is to constitute a separate offense.  In addition, under current law, a municipality may adopt an ordinance, or a harbor commission may adopt a resolution, requiring every owner or operator of a vessel that moors or docks in a municipal waterway or grounds on land under the control of the municipality or harbor commission to register with the appropriate official.  An owner or operator who violates the provisions of the ordinance or resolution is subject to a civil penalty between $100 and $1,250.  Each day upon which the violation continues constitutes a separate offense. Current law provides that these civil penalties are to paid into the treasury of the municipality in which the violation occurred for the general uses of the municipality.  Under this bill, these civil penalties are to be paid to the State Treasurer and deposited into the Abandoned Vessels Fund established by the bill. Finally, the bill provides that in order to be eligible for reimbursement under the program established by the bill, a municipality is required to adopt an ordinance requiring an owner or operator of a vessel that moors or docks in a municipal waterway or grounds on land under the control of the municipality or harbor commission to register with the appropriate official.

In addition, the bill establishes a fund to reimburse municipalities for the cost of removing abandoned vessels and appropriates $25,000,000 for this purpose. Under current law, municipalities are authorized to remove abandoned vessels under certain circumstances.  This bill requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide reimbursement to municipalities for the cost of removing the abandoned vessels.  Under the bill, a municipality may submit an application for reimbursement in a form and manner determined by the State Treasurer. This bill establishes in the Department of the Treasury a separate, nonlapsing fund to be known as the Abandoned Vessels Fund.  The fund is to be administered by the department and dedicated to providing reimbursement to municipalities for the cost of removing abandoned vessels pursuant to the program established by the bill.  The bill provides that the funds contained in the Abandoned Vessels Fund are not to be diverted for another purpose, unless the Legislature approves the diversion by a two-thirds majority. The bill also appropriates from the General Fund to the Department of the Treasury $25,000,000 for the provision of that amount to the Abandoned Vessels Fund for the purposes set forth in the bill. Under current law, it is unlawful for an owner to abandon a vessel on public land or water or private property without the consent of the owner, except when an emergency exists.  An owner who violates this provision is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000.  Each day upon which the violation continues is to constitute a separate offense.  In addition, under current law, a municipality may adopt an ordinance, or a harbor commission may adopt a resolution, requiring every owner or operator of a vessel that moors or docks in a municipal waterway or grounds on land under the control of the municipality or harbor commission to register with the appropriate official.  An owner or operator who violates the provisions of the ordinance or resolution is subject to a civil penalty between $100 and $1,250.  Each day upon which the violation continues constitutes a separate offense. Current law provides that these civil penalties are to paid into the treasury of the municipality in which the violation occurred for the general uses of the municipality.  Under this bill, these civil penalties are to be paid to the State Treasurer and deposited into the Abandoned Vessels Fund established by the bill. Finally, the bill provides that in order to be eligible for reimbursement under the program established by the bill, a municipality is required to adopt an ordinance requiring an owner or operator of a vessel that moors or docks in a municipal waterway or grounds on land under the control of the municipality or harbor commission to register with the appropriate official.
