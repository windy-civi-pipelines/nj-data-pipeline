<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning the South Jersey Transportation Authority
and amending P.L.1991, c.252. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1991,
c.252 (C.27:25A-2) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     It is the public policy
of this State to provide for the coordinated development and planning of the
State's transportation system both on the State and regional level.  Through
the medium of the Transportation Executive Council, established by Executive
Order No. 10 of 1990, the activities of the various transportation related
authorities are coordinated on the State level.  In the northern region of the
State the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority, the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, the North Jersey
Transportation Coordinating Committee and other organizations exist to provide
for the support and planning of the transportation system in that region.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In the southern region
of the State an increase in residential development, the completion of
Interstate Route 476 (also known as the &quot;Blue Route&quot;) in
Pennsylvania, the establishment of casino gaming in Atlantic City, and other
factors, have caused an increase in vehicular traffic in southern New Jersey
and have highlighted the need for a more coordinated effort on a regional basis
to deal with the operation and possible extension of the region's highway
system, the improvement and expansion of its aviation facilities, and the
coordination of Atlantic County's transportation system within the larger
regional system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Concomitant with the
development of the transportation system in southern New Jersey the need exists
for the ancillary establishment of economic development facilities directly
related to transportation projects in that region to be funded by a
transportation authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    It is in the public
interest to create a South Jersey Transportation Authority, encompassing the
counties of Atlantic, <u>Burlington,</u> Camden, Cape May, Cumberland,
Gloucester, and Salem, as a successor to the New Jersey Expressway Authority
and the Atlantic County Transportation Authority, to provide more coordination
of the region's transportation system and to deal particularly with the highway
system, aviation facilities and the transportation problems of Atlantic County
through the acquisition, construction, maintenance, operation and support of
expressway and transportation projects and economic development facilities
directly related to transportation projects authorized by this act.  However,
the activities of a transportation authority are not to supplant or replace the
funding of projects by the Transportation Trust Fund Authority or the operation
of public transportation services by the New Jersey Transit Corporation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2013, c.253, s.7)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 3 of P.L.1991,
c.252 (C.27:25A-3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Air passenger
service&quot; means any service which involves the carriage of persons for
compensation or hire by aircraft.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Atlantic City
Expressway&quot; means the expressway project known as the Atlantic City
Expressway constructed by the New Jersey Expressway Authority pursuant to
section 40 of P.L.1962, c.10 (C.27:12C-40).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Atlantic City
International Airport&quot; means the airport authorized by section 24 of this
act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Atlantic County
Transportation Authority&quot; means the county transportation authority
authorized pursuant to P.L.1980, c.44 (C.40:35B-1 et seq.).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Authority&quot; means
the South Jersey Transportation Authority created by section 4 of this act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Bond&quot; means any
bond or note issued by the authority pursuant to the provisions of this act or
issued by or for an original authority or any predecessor authority thereof, as
the case may be.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Commissioner&quot; means

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Cost&quot; means all or
any part of the expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition,
