S297 SENATE, No. 297 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  BRIAN P. STACK District 33 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS Prohibits sale of cats, dogs, or rabbits by pet shops; prohibits certain transactions between animal shelters, pounds, animal rescue organizations, and animal breeders or brokers; repeals Pet Purchase Protection Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the adoption of animals and the sourcing of animals to animal shelters, pounds, and animal rescue organizations, supplementing Title 4 of the Revised Statutes, amending P.L.1941, c.151, and repealing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that it is an important public policy to support the adoption of homeless animals from animal rescue organizations, animal shelters, and pounds; that consumers have the right to choose responsible breeders from whom to purchase healthy cats, dogs, or rabbits; that despite the consumer protections enacted by the State, pet shops continue to obtain unhealthy cats and dogs from kitten and puppy mills; that with so many adoptable cats and dogs available, it is unnecessary to have pet shops continue to sell cats or dogs; and that rabbits continue to be sold by pet shops in the spring and often end up abandoned at animal rescues, shelters, or pounds. The Legislature furthermore finds and declares that responsible breeders are ones that do not engage in disreputable practices such as selling puppies sight unseen; that responsible dog breeders can play a vital role in the effort to stop  the mistreatment that occurs at puppy mills by offering guidance on the humane breeding and care of dogs and puppies, and educate prospective buyers about the importance of humane breeding and care; that responsible breeders are attentive to the health of their animals, scrutinize pedigrees, test for genetic disease, and breed animals in order to improve the health and well-being of offspring in the animals blood lines; that responsible breeders keep adult animals and the offspring in quarters that allow for optimal exercise; that they feed the animals nutritious foods and provide appropriate general and veterinary care; that they interview prospective owners and sell kittens and puppies with contracts which promise to take back the cat or dog if the new owner cannot continue to care for the animal; that responsible breeders do not raise and keep their animals in inhumane conditions and seldom sell animals to pet stores or ship animals directly via Internet sales; that unlike responsible breeders, commercial kitten and puppy mills do not perform adequate genetic screening, or provide proper housing and veterinary care; that kitten and puppy mills breed large volumes of kittens and puppies and engage in disreputable practices that are harmful to the health of the animals they breed and their offspring; that some puppy mills maintain misleading websites, make false promises, and redirect the public away from responsible breeders; and that while many kitten and puppy mills in the United States are not licensed as required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), even those commercial breeder puppy mills that are licensed by the USDA do not provide humane care because the license only requires minimal standards for animal care and breeding practices. The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the best interest of the citizens of the State to prohibit the sale of cats, dogs, and rabbits by pet shops; that establishing a prohibition would close an avenue to the sale of kitten and puppy mill cats and dogs to consumers; that it is also in the best interest of the citizens of the State to encourage pet shops to facilitate and achieve more successful adoptions by collaborating with animal rescue organizations, shelters, and pounds and showcasing cats and dogs available for adoption; that successful adoptions would be further supported by veterinary examinations and the establishment of animal health histories and animal health certificates for animals being offered for adoption; that responsible breeding would be encouraged by prohibiting breeders and brokers from receiving compensation from pet shops, animal rescue organizations, shelters, or pounds to which the breeders or brokers provide animals; and that it is important to reaffirm consumer rights under consumer fraud laws and hold all pet dealers responsible for the health of the animals they sell. 2.    (New section) As used in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Animal rescue organization means an animal rescue organization, as defined in section 1 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.1), whose primary mission and practice is the placement of abandoned, unwanted, neglected, or abused animals, or is a nonprofit organization established for the purpose of rescuing animals and is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. s.501(c)(3). Breeder means any person, firm, corporation, or organization in the business of breeding cats or dogs. Broker means any person, firm, corporation, or organization who transfers a cat or dog for resale by another. Consumer means a person purchasing a cat or dog not for the purposes of resale. Department means the Department of Health. Director means the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Division means the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Pet dealer means any person engaged in the ordinary course of business in the sale of cats or dogs to the public for profit or any person who sells or offers for sale more than five cats or dogs in one year.  The term pet dealer shall not include a pet shop. Pet shop means a pet shop as defined in section 1 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.1). Pound means a pound as defined in section 1 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.1). Shelter means an establishment where dogs or other animals are received, housed, and distributed, whose primary mission and practice is the placement of abandoned, unwanted, neglected or abused animals, that does not obtain cats or dogs from a breeder or broker for payment or compensation, and that is either maintained by or under contract with a state, county, or municipality or is a nonprofit organization established for the purpose of sheltering animals and is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. s.501(c)(3). Unfit for purchase means having any disease, deformity, injury, physical condition, illness or defect which is congenital or hereditary and severely affects the health of the animal, or which was manifest, capable of diagnosis or likely contracted on or before the sale and delivery of the animal to the consumer. Veterinarian means a veterinarian licensed to practice in the State of New Jersey. 3.    (New section)  a.  No provision of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be construed in any way to alter, diminish, replace, or revoke the requirements for pet dealers that are not pet shops or the rights of a consumer purchasing an animal from a pet dealer that is not a pet shop, as may be provided elsewhere in law or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto.  Any provision of law pertaining to pet shops, or rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, that does not pertain to the sale of cats, dogs, or rabbits shall continue to apply to pet shops.

However, the licensed shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound may place the animal in an animal rescue organization facility, foster home, or other unlicensed facility if necessary pursuant to subsection e. or h. of this section. l.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and sections 3 and 4 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and C.4:19-15.31) to the contrary, no cat or dog being transferred between shelters, pounds, or kennels operating as shelters or pounds, or being transferred to an animal rescue organization facility or placed in a foster home, shall be required to be sterilized prior to that transfer. (cf: P.L.2012, c.17, s.7) 13.  Section 6 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.33) is amended to read as follows: 6.    a.  The Department of Health shall establish a registry of animal rescue organizations and their facilities in the State.  [Any] Every animal rescue organization [may voluntarily participate in the registry] operating in the State shall register with the department. b.    The department, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), [may] shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of animal rescue organization facilities, and any rules and regulations determined necessary to implement the [voluntary] registry , the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), [establish] and to coordinate [its] the use of the registry and implementation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) with the provisions of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 et al.) and section 16 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.16). c.     The Department of Health shall establish and provide on the departments website a contact telephone number and email address for contacting the department with concerns and questions in regards to animal rescue organizations and their facilities in the State. (cf: P.L.2012, c.17, s.13) 14.  The following sections are repealed:  Sections 1 through 5, and section 7 of P.L.1999, c.331 (C.56:8-92 through C.56:8-95, C.56:8-96, and C.56:8-97); and sections 3 through 5 of P.L.2015, c.7 (C.56:8-95.1 through C.56:8-95.3). 15.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill repeals the Pet Purchase Protection Act, P.L.1999, c.336 (C.56:8-92 et seq.) and replaces it with a prohibition on the sale of cats, dogs, and rabbits by pet shops. The bill also imposes several other requirements concerning the sale and adoption of animals. The bill provides that, without limiting the prosecution of any other practices which may be unlawful pursuant to State consumer fraud laws, it would be an unlawful practice and a violation of State consumer fraud law, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), for any breeder or broker to knowingly sell a cat or dog that is unfit for purchase.  The bill defines unfit for purchase as having any disease, deformity, injury, physical condition, illness or defect which is congenital or hereditary and severely affects the health of the animal, or which was manifest, capable of diagnosis or likely contracted on or before the sale and delivery of the animal to the consumer.  The bill specifies that the death of an animal within 14 days of its delivery to the consumer, except by death by accident or as a result of injuries sustained during that period, would be construed to mean the animal was unfit for purchase. The bill establishes a prohibition on the sale of cats, dogs, or rabbits by pet shops.  The bill authorizes a pet shop to: 1) sell or offer for sale any other type of animal as may be otherwise permitted pursuant to State law or regulation, or sell or offer for sale pet supplies for any type of animal, including a cat, dog, or rabbit, if it is licensed by its municipality to do so; and 2) offer, in collaboration with an animal rescue organization, shelter, or pound, space in the pet shop to showcase cats, dogs, and rabbits that are available for adoption, provided that no payment or compensation, monetary or otherwise, is exchanged between the pet shop and animal rescue organization, shelter, or pound, for the use of the pet shop or for the adoption of any cat, dog, rabbit, or any other animal. The bill prohibits animal rescue organizations, animal rescue organization facilities, pet shops, shelters, or pounds from obtaining a cat, dog, or rabbit from a breeder or broker in exchange for any type of compensation. The bill establishes additional requirements concerning animal adoptions. The bill requires that, when the animal is first available for adoption, the animal be examined by a veterinarian.  The veterinarian is required to establish an animal health history and issue an animal health certificate based on the examination that documents the name and address of the examining veterinarian and the health and condition of the animal, including the health information specified in subsection b. of section 7 of the bill. The bill requires the animal be re-examined and the history and certificate updated accordingly if the animal is not adopted within 14 days after the initial veterinary examination, but no more than five days before the animal is released to the adoptive owner.  The bill requires that the adoptive owner receive a copy of the current animal health history and animal health certificate of the animal.  The bill also authorizes charging the adoptive owner a reasonable fee to defray the costs of the examination and the issuance of the animal health history and animal health certificate of the animal. The bill specifies that: 1)  no provision of the bill can be construed to alter, diminish, replace, or revoke the requirements for pet dealers that are not pet shops or the rights of a consumer purchasing an animal from a pet dealer that is not a pet shop, as may be provided elsewhere in law or any rule or regulation; 2)  any provision of law or regulation pertaining to pet shops that does not pertain to the sale of cats, dogs, or rabbits would continue to apply to pet shops; and 3)  no provision of the bill can be construed to alter, diminish, replace, or revoke any recourse or remedy that is otherwise available to a consumer purchasing a cat, dog, rabbit, or any other type of animal and provided under any other law. The bill specifies that the bills provisions cannot be construed to interfere with the implementation of, or otherwise invalidate, or limit or restrict any municipality, county, local health agency, or municipal or county board of health from enacting or enforcing, any law, ordinance, rule, or regulation that places additional obligations or restrictions on pet shops, pet shop sales, breeders, brokers, or breeder or broker sales. The bill establishes, in addition to any penalties imposed pursuant to the State consumer fraud law, a fine of $500 for each violation of the bill, including failing to provide required information or providing false information, to be collected in a civil action under the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.). Finally, the bill authorizes the Department of Health and the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety to adopt any rules or regulations necessary to implement the bills provisions.

The Legislature furthermore finds and declares that responsible breeders are ones that do not engage in disreputable practices such as selling puppies sight unseen; that responsible dog breeders can play a vital role in the effort to stop  the mistreatment that occurs at puppy mills by offering guidance on the humane breeding and care of dogs and puppies, and educate prospective buyers about the importance of humane breeding and care; that responsible breeders are attentive to the health of their animals, scrutinize pedigrees, test for genetic disease, and breed animals in order to improve the health and well-being of offspring in the animals blood lines; that responsible breeders keep adult animals and the offspring in quarters that allow for optimal exercise; that they feed the animals nutritious foods and provide appropriate general and veterinary care; that they interview prospective owners and sell kittens and puppies with contracts which promise to take back the cat or dog if the new owner cannot continue to care for the animal; that responsible breeders do not raise and keep their animals in inhumane conditions and seldom sell animals to pet stores or ship animals directly via Internet sales; that unlike responsible breeders, commercial kitten and puppy mills do not perform adequate genetic screening, or provide proper housing and veterinary care; that kitten and puppy mills breed large volumes of kittens and puppies and engage in disreputable practices that are harmful to the health of the animals they breed and their offspring; that some puppy mills maintain misleading websites, make false promises, and redirect the public away from responsible breeders; and that while many kitten and puppy mills in the United States are not licensed as required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), even those commercial breeder puppy mills that are licensed by the USDA do not provide humane care because the license only requires minimal standards for animal care and breeding practices. The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the best interest of the citizens of the State to prohibit the sale of cats, dogs, and rabbits by pet shops; that establishing a prohibition would close an avenue to the sale of kitten and puppy mill cats and dogs to consumers; that it is also in the best interest of the citizens of the State to encourage pet shops to facilitate and achieve more successful adoptions by collaborating with animal rescue organizations, shelters, and pounds and showcasing cats and dogs available for adoption; that successful adoptions would be further supported by veterinary examinations and the establishment of animal health histories and animal health certificates for animals being offered for adoption; that responsible breeding would be encouraged by prohibiting breeders and brokers from receiving compensation from pet shops, animal rescue organizations, shelters, or pounds to which the breeders or brokers provide animals; and that it is important to reaffirm consumer rights under consumer fraud laws and hold all pet dealers responsible for the health of the animals they sell. 2.    (New section) As used in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Animal rescue organization means an animal rescue organization, as defined in section 1 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.1), whose primary mission and practice is the placement of abandoned, unwanted, neglected, or abused animals, or is a nonprofit organization established for the purpose of rescuing animals and is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. s.501(c)(3). Breeder means any person, firm, corporation, or organization in the business of breeding cats or dogs. Broker means any person, firm, corporation, or organization who transfers a cat or dog for resale by another. Consumer means a person purchasing a cat or dog not for the purposes of resale. Department means the Department of Health. Director means the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Division means the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Pet dealer means any person engaged in the ordinary course of business in the sale of cats or dogs to the public for profit or any person who sells or offers for sale more than five cats or dogs in one year.  The term pet dealer shall not include a pet shop. Pet shop means a pet shop as defined in section 1 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.1). Pound means a pound as defined in section 1 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.1). Shelter means an establishment where dogs or other animals are received, housed, and distributed, whose primary mission and practice is the placement of abandoned, unwanted, neglected or abused animals, that does not obtain cats or dogs from a breeder or broker for payment or compensation, and that is either maintained by or under contract with a state, county, or municipality or is a nonprofit organization established for the purpose of sheltering animals and is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. s.501(c)(3). Unfit for purchase means having any disease, deformity, injury, physical condition, illness or defect which is congenital or hereditary and severely affects the health of the animal, or which was manifest, capable of diagnosis or likely contracted on or before the sale and delivery of the animal to the consumer. Veterinarian means a veterinarian licensed to practice in the State of New Jersey. 3.    (New section)  a.  No provision of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be construed in any way to alter, diminish, replace, or revoke the requirements for pet dealers that are not pet shops or the rights of a consumer purchasing an animal from a pet dealer that is not a pet shop, as may be provided elsewhere in law or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto.  Any provision of law pertaining to pet shops, or rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, that does not pertain to the sale of cats, dogs, or rabbits shall continue to apply to pet shops.

or (2)   the animal is suspected of being rabid, in which case the provisions of subsection j. of this section shall apply. e.     If a shelter, pound or kennel operating as a shelter or pound is not required to hold an animal for at least seven days pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection d. of this section, the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound: (1)   shall offer the animal for adoption for at least seven days before euthanizing it; or (2)   may transfer the animal to an animal rescue organization facility or a foster home prior to offering it for adoption if such a transfer is determined to be in the best interest of the animal by the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound. f.     Except as otherwise provided for under subsection e. of this section, no shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound receiving an animal from a certified animal control officer may transfer the animal to an animal rescue organization facility or a foster home until the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound has held the animal for at least seven days. g.    If the owner or the person charged with the care of the animal seeks to claim it within seven days, or after the seven days have elapsed but before the animal has been adopted or euthanized, the shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound: (1)   shall, in the case of a cat or dog, release it to the owner or person charged with its care, provided the owner or person charged with the care of the animal provides proof of ownership, which may include a valid cat or dog license, registration, rabies inoculation certificate, or documentation from the owner's veterinarian that the cat or dog has received regular care from that veterinarian;

However, the licensed shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound may place the animal in an animal rescue organization facility, foster home, or other unlicensed facility if necessary pursuant to subsection e. or h. of this section. l.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and sections 3 and 4 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and C.4:19-15.31) to the contrary, no cat or dog being transferred between shelters, pounds, or kennels operating as shelters or pounds, or being transferred to an animal rescue organization facility or placed in a foster home, shall be required to be sterilized prior to that transfer. (cf: P.L.2012, c.17, s.7) 13.  Section 6 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.33) is amended to read as follows: 6.    a.  The Department of Health shall establish a registry of animal rescue organizations and their facilities in the State.  [Any] Every animal rescue organization [may voluntarily participate in the registry] operating in the State shall register with the department. b.    The department, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), [may] shall adopt rules and regulations for the operation of animal rescue organization facilities, and any rules and regulations determined necessary to implement the [voluntary] registry , the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), [establish] and to coordinate [its] the use of the registry and implementation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) with the provisions of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 et al.) and section 16 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.16). c.     The Department of Health shall establish and provide on the departments website a contact telephone number and email address for contacting the department with concerns and questions in regards to animal rescue organizations and their facilities in the State. (cf: P.L.2012, c.17, s.13) 14.  The following sections are repealed:  Sections 1 through 5, and section 7 of P.L.1999, c.331 (C.56:8-92 through C.56:8-95, C.56:8-96, and C.56:8-97); and sections 3 through 5 of P.L.2015, c.7 (C.56:8-95.1 through C.56:8-95.3). 15.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill repeals the Pet Purchase Protection Act, P.L.1999, c.336 (C.56:8-92 et seq.) and replaces it with a prohibition on the sale of cats, dogs, and rabbits by pet shops. The bill also imposes several other requirements concerning the sale and adoption of animals. The bill provides that, without limiting the prosecution of any other practices which may be unlawful pursuant to State consumer fraud laws, it would be an unlawful practice and a violation of State consumer fraud law, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), for any breeder or broker to knowingly sell a cat or dog that is unfit for purchase.  The bill defines unfit for purchase as having any disease, deformity, injury, physical condition, illness or defect which is congenital or hereditary and severely affects the health of the animal, or which was manifest, capable of diagnosis or likely contracted on or before the sale and delivery of the animal to the consumer.  The bill specifies that the death of an animal within 14 days of its delivery to the consumer, except by death by accident or as a result of injuries sustained during that period, would be construed to mean the animal was unfit for purchase. The bill establishes a prohibition on the sale of cats, dogs, or rabbits by pet shops.  The bill authorizes a pet shop to: 1) sell or offer for sale any other type of animal as may be otherwise permitted pursuant to State law or regulation, or sell or offer for sale pet supplies for any type of animal, including a cat, dog, or rabbit, if it is licensed by its municipality to do so; and 2) offer, in collaboration with an animal rescue organization, shelter, or pound, space in the pet shop to showcase cats, dogs, and rabbits that are available for adoption, provided that no payment or compensation, monetary or otherwise, is exchanged between the pet shop and animal rescue organization, shelter, or pound, for the use of the pet shop or for the adoption of any cat, dog, rabbit, or any other animal. The bill prohibits animal rescue organizations, animal rescue organization facilities, pet shops, shelters, or pounds from obtaining a cat, dog, or rabbit from a breeder or broker in exchange for any type of compensation. The bill establishes additional requirements concerning animal adoptions. The bill requires that, when the animal is first available for adoption, the animal be examined by a veterinarian.  The veterinarian is required to establish an animal health history and issue an animal health certificate based on the examination that documents the name and address of the examining veterinarian and the health and condition of the animal, including the health information specified in subsection b. of section 7 of the bill. The bill requires the animal be re-examined and the history and certificate updated accordingly if the animal is not adopted within 14 days after the initial veterinary examination, but no more than five days before the animal is released to the adoptive owner.  The bill requires that the adoptive owner receive a copy of the current animal health history and animal health certificate of the animal.  The bill also authorizes charging the adoptive owner a reasonable fee to defray the costs of the examination and the issuance of the animal health history and animal health certificate of the animal. The bill specifies that: 1)  no provision of the bill can be construed to alter, diminish, replace, or revoke the requirements for pet dealers that are not pet shops or the rights of a consumer purchasing an animal from a pet dealer that is not a pet shop, as may be provided elsewhere in law or any rule or regulation; 2)  any provision of law or regulation pertaining to pet shops that does not pertain to the sale of cats, dogs, or rabbits would continue to apply to pet shops; and 3)  no provision of the bill can be construed to alter, diminish, replace, or revoke any recourse or remedy that is otherwise available to a consumer purchasing a cat, dog, rabbit, or any other type of animal and provided under any other law. The bill specifies that the bills provisions cannot be construed to interfere with the implementation of, or otherwise invalidate, or limit or restrict any municipality, county, local health agency, or municipal or county board of health from enacting or enforcing, any law, ordinance, rule, or regulation that places additional obligations or restrictions on pet shops, pet shop sales, breeders, brokers, or breeder or broker sales. The bill establishes, in addition to any penalties imposed pursuant to the State consumer fraud law, a fine of $500 for each violation of the bill, including failing to provide required information or providing false information, to be collected in a civil action under the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.). Finally, the bill authorizes the Department of Health and the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety to adopt any rules or regulations necessary to implement the bills provisions.
