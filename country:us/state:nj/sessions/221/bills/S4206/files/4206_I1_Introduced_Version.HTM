<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    Section 5 of P.L.1997,
c.411 (C.39:4-10.9) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    a.   A person, firm,
corporation or other legal entity regularly engaged in the business of selling
or renting roller skates or skateboards shall post a sign at the point where
the sale or rental transaction is completed stating:  STATE LAW REQUIRES A
PERSON UNDER 17 YEARS OF AGE TO WEAR A HELMET WHEN ROLLER SKATING OR
SKATEBOARDING. <u>STATE LAW PROHIBITS ANY PERSON UNDER 16 YEARS OF AGE FROM
OPERATING A MOTORIZED SKATEBOARD AND REQUIRES A PERSON TO WEAR A HELMET WHEN
USING A MOTORIZED SKATEBOARD.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The size of the sign shall be
at a minimum 15 inches in length and 8 inches in width.  This notification
requirement shall not apply to a seller when roller skates <u>or motorized
skateboards</u> are sold through the use of a mail order catalog or brochure
where the purchase and payment are made by mail, telephone or another
telecommunications or electronic method.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A person, firm,

subsection a. of this section shall be subject to a penalty not to exceed $25 a
day for each day the business is open to the public and the sign is not
posted.  The enforcement of this subsection shall be vested in the director,
the inspectors appointed under his authority and the police or peace officers
of, or inspectors duly appointed for this purpose by, any municipality or
county or the State.  Jurisdiction of proceedings to collect the penalties
prescribed by this act is vested in the Superior Court and the municipal court
in any municipality where the defendant resides.  Process shall be either a
summons or warrant and shall be executed in a summary manner pursuant to the
&quot;Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999,&quot; P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et
seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A person, firm,
corporation or other legal entity regularly engaged in the business of renting
roller skates or skateboards shall make available an approved helmet to a
person under 17 years of age who rents the roller skates or skateboards <u>, or
any person who rents a motorized skateboard,</u> for use in an area where a
helmet is required, if the person does not already have a helmet in his
possession. A fee may be charged for the helmet rental.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A person, firm,
corporation or other legal entity regularly engaged in the business of selling
or renting roller skates or skateboards who complies with the applicable
requirements of this section shall not be liable in a civil action for damages
for any physical injury sustained by a user of roller skates or a skateboard
who is under the age of 17 years <u>, or a user of a motorized skateboard,</u>
as a result of that person's failure to wear a helmet in accordance with the
provisions of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Sixty days before the
effective date of this act, the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department
of Law and Public Safety shall make a reasonable effort to notify any person,
firm, corporation or other legal entity who is regularly engaged in the
business of selling or renting roller skates or skateboards of the requirements
of this section.  The responsibility of a person, firm, corporation or other
legal entity under this section shall not be abrogated or diminished in any
manner if the person fails to receive or become aware of a notice from the
division.</p>

shall not operate a motorized skateboard at a speed greater than 10 miles per
hour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>This bill </span>restricts the use of motorized
skateboards, including hoverboards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A motorized skateboard is
defined in current law, at N.J.S.A.39:1-1, as a skateboard that is propelled
otherwise than by muscular power.  The bill revises this definition to clarify
that a motorized skateboard includes a two-wheeled, self-balancing electric
skateboard, commonly known as a hoverboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires a
person operating a motorized skateboard to wear a properly fitted and fastened
helmet and to be at least 16 years of age. The bill prohibits a person from
operating a motorized skateboard at a speed greater than 10 miles per hour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person under the age of 16
who operates a motorized skateboard in violation of the bills provisions would
be warned of the violation by the enforcing official.  The parent or legal
guardian of the violator may be fined a maximum of $25 for a first offense and
a maximum of $100 for a subsequent offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to the
requirements under current law, a business selling or renting motorized
skateboards would be required to post a sign at the point where the sale or
rental transaction is completed stating: STATE LAW PROHIBITS ANY PERSON UNDER
16 YEARS OF AGE FROM OPERATING A MOTORIZED SKATEBOARD AND REQUIRES A PERSON TO
WEAR A HELMET WHEN USING A MOTORIZED SKATEBOARD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is similar to a
California law that regulates the use of motorized skateboards.  </p>
