ATKINS District 20 (Union) Assemblywoman  BARBARA MCCANN STAMATO District 31 (Hudson) Assemblywoman  SHANIQUE SPEIGHT District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblyman Sampson and Assemblywoman Morales SYNOPSIS Requires school districts to provide instruction on artificial intelligence; requires Secretary of Higher Education to develop artificial intelligence model curricula. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning artificial intelligence curricula, certificates, and degree programs, and supplementing Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  As used in this section, artificial intelligence means a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action. b.    Each school district shall incorporate instruction on artificial intelligence in an appropriate place in the curriculum of students in grades kindergarten through 12 as part of the districts implementation of the New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Computer Science and Design Thinking. c.     The instruction shall include, at a minimum, information on: (1)   general concepts of artificial intelligence; (2)   foundational skills required to become artificial intelligence users; and (3)   best practices to ensure the responsible, appropriate, and ethical use of artificial intelligence. d.    The Commissioner of Education shall provide school districts with age-appropriate sample learning activities and resources designed to implement the requirement established pursuant to subsection b. of this section. 2.    a.  Each public institution of higher education shall offer certificate and degree programs in artificial intelligence. b.    The Secretary of Higher Education, in consultation with the Commissioner of Education, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, the Economic Development Authority, the New Jersey Council of County Colleges, the New Jersey Presidents Council, and the Chief Innovation Officer for the State, shall develop an artificial intelligence model curriculum for use by public four-year institutions of higher education in the State and an artificial intelligence model curriculum for use by county colleges in the State.  The model curricula developed pursuant to this subsection shall be made available to assist public four-year institutions of higher education and county colleges in implementing the certificate and degree programs requirement established pursuant to subsection a. of this section. c.     The artificial intelligence model curricula developed pursuant to subsection b. of this section shall account for academic quality and other applicable standards required for accreditation of artificial intelligence-related degree programs. The model curricula shall, at a minimum: (1)   provide a comprehensive sequence of courses that will ensure adequate preparation for further postsecondary education or a career in the field of artificial intelligence; (2)   include a list of courses that would be suitable for artificial intelligence-related degree programs; (3)   detail any requirements, other than coursework, that may be part of artificial intelligence-related degree programs; and (4)   detail overall expected student outcomes for artificial intelligence-related degree programs as well as expected student outcomes for individual artificial intelligence courses. d.    As part of the development of the artificial intelligence model curricula required pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development and the Economic Development Authority, in consultation with the New Jersey Council of County Colleges, the New Jersey Presidents Council and the Chief Innovation Officer for the State, shall develop and distribute to public institutions of higher education artificial intelligence career pathway marketing materials that provide descriptions of artificial intelligence careers and the benefits of pursuing those careers. e.     As used in this section, artificial intelligence means a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action. 3.    Section 1 of this act shall take effect immediately and shall first apply in the first full school year following the date of enactment.  Section 2 of this act shall take effective immediately and shall first apply in the first full academic year following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires instruction on artificial intelligence.  Under the bill, school districts are required to incorporate instruction on artificial intelligence in an appropriate place in the curriculum of students in grades kindergarten through 12 as part of the districts implementation of the New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Computer Science and Design Thinking.  The bill also requires the Commissioner of Education to provide school districts with age-appropriate sample learning activities and resources designed to implement the artificial intelligence curriculum requirement. Additionally, the bill requires each public institution of higher education to offer certificate and degree programs in artificial intelligence.  The bill requires the Secretary of Higher Education, in consultation with the Commissioner of Education, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, the Economic Development Authority, the New Jersey Council of County Colleges, the New Jersey Presidents Council, and the Chief Innovation Officer for the State, to develop an artificial intelligence model curriculum for use by public four-year institutions of higher education in the State and an artificial intelligence model curriculum for use by county colleges in the State.  The model curricula developed is to be made available to assist public four-year institutions of higher education and county colleges in implementing the certificate and degree programs requirement established in the bill. Under the bill, the artificial intelligence model curricula is to account for academic quality and other applicable standards required for accreditation of artificial intelligence-related degree programs.  Additionally, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development and the Economic Development Authority, in consultation with the New Jersey Council of County Colleges, the New Jersey Presidents Council and the Chief Innovation Officer for the State, is required to develop and distribute to public institutions of higher education artificial intelligence career pathway marketing materials that provide descriptions of artificial intelligence careers and the benefits of pursuing those careers.
