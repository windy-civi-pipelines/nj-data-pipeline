(1) Within nine months after the effective date of P.L.2008, c.48 (C.26:6-66 et al.) and pursuant to P.L.2017, c.377, the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission shall ensure access by residents to an Internet-based interface that promotes organ and tissue donation and enables residents 14 years of age or older to register as donors and have their decisions immediately integrated into the current database maintained by the commission. The database shall include only affirmative donation decisions and default donation designations required pursuant to section a. of section 1 of P.L.1978, c.181 (C.39:3-12.2). (2)   Within one year of the effective date of P.L.2008, c.48 (C.26:6-66 et al.) and pursuant to P.L.2017, c.377, the commission shall establish a system which allows New Jersey holders of examination permits, special learner's permits, motorcycle-only examination permits, driver's licenses, motorcycle licenses, motorized bicycle licenses, or personal identification cards who do not have access to the Internet-based interface to add their donor designation to the Donate Life NJ Registry by submitting a paper form to the commission. Registration shall be provided at no cost to the registrant. b.    The database and Internet-based interface established in this section shall be known as the Donate Life NJ Registry. c.     The form and content of the Internet-based interface shall be designed in collaboration with the organ procurement organizations designated pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s.1320b-8 to serve in the State of New Jersey. d.    Donor information entered into the registry shall supersede any prior conflicting information provided to the registry or on the individual's examination permit, special learner's permit, motorcycle-only examination permit, driver's license, motorcycle license, motorized bicycle license, or identification card, and pursuant to P.L.2008, c.50 (C.26:6-77 et seq.) or any subsequent statute adopted pursuant thereto, registration by a donor shall constitute sufficient authorization to donate organ and tissues for transplantation and therapy and authorization of another person shall not be necessary to effectuate the gift. e.     Within one year of the effective date of P.L.2008, c.48 (C.26:6-66 et al.), the Donate Life NJ Registry and the official website of the commission shall provide links through which individuals may make voluntary contributions of $1 or more to the Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Education Fund established by P.L.1999, c.386 (C.54A:9-25.17 et seq.).  Such opportunities shall include both electronic and paper contributions.  The links shall be provided in connection with the issuance of permits, licenses, personal identification cards, and the registration of motor vehicles. (cf: P.L.2017, c.377, s.3) 3.    Section 8 of P.L.2008, c.48 (C.39:3-12.4) is amended to read as follows: 8.    a. Beginning five years after the effective date of P.L.2008, c.48 (C.26:6-66 et al.) and pursuant to P.L.2017, c.377, an examination permit, special learner's permit, motorcycle-only examination permit, driver's license, motorcycle license, motorized bicycle license, or personal identification card shall not be issued or renewed unless the applicant first addresses the issue of donation through an on-line portal connected to the Donate Life NJ Registry or at New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission agencies and regional service centers. b.    The portal shall be accessible to applicants seven days per week, 24 hours per day, and shall provide for adequate security to protect an individual's privacy.  The form and content of the portal shall be designed in collaboration with the organ procurement organizations designated pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s.1320b-8 to serve in the State of New Jersey. c.     The portal shall require a resident who [has not registered as] wishes to opt out of being an organ donor, and who seeks an examination permit, special learner's permit, motorcycle-only examination permit, driver's license, motorcycle license, motorized bicycle license, or identification card or seeks renewal thereof, to [either: (1) register as an organ donor through the Donate Life NJ Registry; or (2)] review information about the life-saving potential of organ and tissue donation, and the consequences when an individual [does not make a decision to become] opts out of being an organ donor and does not register or otherwise record a designated decision-maker. In addition to promoting organ and tissue donation, the portal shall provide information about the procedure for designating a decision-maker. d.    Any information technology system adopted by the commission after the effective date of P.L.2008, c.48 (C.26:6-66 et al.) shall accommodate the inclusion of donor information into the database and the on-going operation of the Donate Life NJ Registry. (cf: P.L.2017, c.377, s.4) 4.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month following enactment, but the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill amends the motor vehicle laws regarding designation as an organ donor.  Under current law, New Jersey has an opt in system for registering to be an organ donor when applying for or renewing a motor vehicle license or identification card.  At the time of application for a new license, renewal license, identification card or renewal identification card a resident is provided with the opportunity to designate that the person shall donate all or any organs or tissues for the purposes of transplantation or therapy.  This bill amends current law to provide for an opt out system where the default designation on every license or identification card issued is to be that a person is an organ donor.  A person wishing to opt out of organ donation is required to make an affirmative designation to that effect.  This provision does not apply to persons under the age of 18. The bill adds residents 18 years of age and older having default donor designations to the Donate Life NJ Registry. This bill also changes the requirements for the promotion of organ and tissue donation by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission.  Currently, a license or identification card is not to be issued or renewed unless the applicant first addresses the issue of organ donation.  Applicants who are not registered as organ donors are required to register as an organ donor or review information about organ donation.  The bill amends this section of law to provide that any resident who wishes to opt out of organ donation is to review these materials.
