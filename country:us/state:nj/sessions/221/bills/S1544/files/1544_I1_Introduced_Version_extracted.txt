Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 5 of P.L.2018, c.45 (C.54A:4-17) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a.  A resident taxpayer with New Jersey taxable income of [$60,000] $150,000 or less who is allowed a credit for expenses for household and dependent care services for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.21) shall be allowed a credit against the tax otherwise due pursuant to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.  The credit shall be in an amount equal to a percentage of the credit allowed the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year, according to the following schedule: NJ taxable income is:                                    Amount of NJ credit is: [Not over $20,000                                         50% of federal credit over $20,000 but not over $30,000               40% of federal credit over $30,000 but not over $40,000               30% of federal credit over $40,000 but not over $50,000              20% of federal credit over $50,000 but not over $60,000              10% of federal credit.] Not over $50,000                                           50% of federal credit over $50,000 but not over $75,000               40% of federal credit over $75,000 but not over $100,000             30% of federal credit over $100,000 but not over $125,000          20% of federal credit over $125,000 but not over $150,000          10% of federal credit.

The bill also increases the amount of the State credit available to taxpayers by expanding qualifying income brackets.  For example, under current law, the State credit a taxpayer with income less than $20,000 receives is equal to 50 percent of their federal credit.  The bill increases the $20,000 income limit to $50,000, and all other brackets have also been expanded to allow more taxpayers to qualify for enhanced benefits. In addition, the bill increases the maximum credit allowed for a taxable year to $1,000 for employment-related expenses paid by the taxpayer for one qualifying individual and $2,000 for employment-related expenses paid by the taxpayer for two or more qualifying individuals.  Under current law, the maximum credit allowed is $500 for employment-related expenses paid by the taxpayer for one qualifying individual and $1,000 for employment-related expenses paid by the taxpayer for two or more qualifying individuals.
