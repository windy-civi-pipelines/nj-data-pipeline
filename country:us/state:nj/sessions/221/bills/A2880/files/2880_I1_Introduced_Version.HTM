Construction and Severability This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any member state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. Section 15. Binding Effect of Compact and Other Laws a.     A licensee providing professional counseling services in a remote state under the privilege to practice shall adhere to the laws and regulations, including scope of practice, of the remote state. b.    Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact. c.     Any laws in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. d.    Any lawful actions of the commission, including all rules and bylaws properly promulgated by the commission, are binding upon the member states. e.     All permissible agreements between the commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. f.     In the event any provision of the compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any member state, the provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill enters New Jersey into the Counseling Compact.  The Counseling Compact (compact) is an interstate compact, or a contract among states, allowing professional counselors licensed and residing in a compact member state to practice in other compact member states without need for multiple licenses. The purpose of this compact is to facilitate interstate practice of licensed professional counselors with the goal of improving public access to professional counseling services.  The practice of professional counseling occurs in the state where the client is located at the time of the counseling services.  The compact preserves the regulatory authority of states to protect public health and safety through the current system of state licensure.  In addition, the compact is designed to achieve the following objectives:  1) increase public access to professional counseling services by providing for the mutual recognition of other member state licenses; 2) enhance the states ability to protect the publics health and safety; 3) encourage the cooperation of member states in regulating multistate practice for licensed professional counselors; 4) support spouses of relocating active duty military personnel; 5) enhance the exchange of licensure, investigative, and disciplinary information among member states; 6) allow for the use of telehealth technology to facilitate increased access to professional counseling services; 7) support the uniformity of professional counseling licensure requirements throughout the states to promote public safety and public health benefits; 8) invest all member states with the authority to hold a licensed professional counselor accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the client is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of member state  licenses; 9) eliminate the necessity for licenses in multiple states; and 10) provide opportunities for interstate practice by licensed professional counselors who meet uniform licensure requirements. The compact is administered by a commission comprising representatives of each of the member states.  The commission has certain powers to promulgate rules and bylaws, create a budget, conduct investigations, assess member fees, and to generally enforce the provisions of the compact.  The compact sets forth procedures for investigating and disciplining professional counselors for misconduct, as well as for communicating to member states information concerning a professional counselor who is under investigation, has lost the right to practice under the compact, or who has regained the right to practice under the compact. The compact provides that it takes effect when it has been adopted in 10 states.  Currently, 16 states have joined the compact:   Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia.

STATEMENT This bill enters New Jersey into the Counseling Compact.  The Counseling Compact (compact) is an interstate compact, or a contract among states, allowing professional counselors licensed and residing in a compact member state to practice in other compact member states without need for multiple licenses. The purpose of this compact is to facilitate interstate practice of licensed professional counselors with the goal of improving public access to professional counseling services.  The practice of professional counseling occurs in the state where the client is located at the time of the counseling services.  The compact preserves the regulatory authority of states to protect public health and safety through the current system of state licensure.  In addition, the compact is designed to achieve the following objectives:  1) increase public access to professional counseling services by providing for the mutual recognition of other member state licenses; 2) enhance the states ability to protect the publics health and safety; 3) encourage the cooperation of member states in regulating multistate practice for licensed professional counselors; 4) support spouses of relocating active duty military personnel; 5) enhance the exchange of licensure, investigative, and disciplinary information among member states; 6) allow for the use of telehealth technology to facilitate increased access to professional counseling services; 7) support the uniformity of professional counseling licensure requirements throughout the states to promote public safety and public health benefits; 8) invest all member states with the authority to hold a licensed professional counselor accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the client is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of member state  licenses; 9) eliminate the necessity for licenses in multiple states; and 10) provide opportunities for interstate practice by licensed professional counselors who meet uniform licensure requirements. The compact is administered by a commission comprising representatives of each of the member states.  The commission has certain powers to promulgate rules and bylaws, create a budget, conduct investigations, assess member fees, and to generally enforce the provisions of the compact.  The compact sets forth procedures for investigating and disciplining professional counselors for misconduct, as well as for communicating to member states information concerning a professional counselor who is under investigation, has lost the right to practice under the compact, or who has regained the right to practice under the compact. The compact provides that it takes effect when it has been adopted in 10 states.  Currently, 16 states have joined the compact:   Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia.
