S3533 SCS SENATE COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE FOR SENATE, No. 3533 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE ADOPTED MARCH 17, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  ANGELA V. MCKNIGHT District 31 (Hudson) Senator  JON M. BRAMNICK District 21 (Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union) Co-Sponsored by: Senators Wimberly and Greenstein SYNOPSIS Establishes certain guidelines for SHBP, SEHBP, and Medicaid concerning step therapy protocols. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Substitute as adopted by the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee. An Act concerning step therapy protocols and supplementing Titles 30 and 52 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     To address the increasingly high cost of prescription drug utilization and to address patient safety, health insurance carriers and other plan sponsors use step therapy protocols that require patients to try one or more prescription drugs before coverage is provided for a drug selected by the patients health care provider. b.    Step therapy protocols, if based on well-developed scientific standards and administered in a flexible manner that takes into account the individual needs of patients, can play an important role in controlling health care costs. c.     Requiring a patient to follow a step therapy protocol may have adverse and even dangerous consequences for the patient, who may either not realize a benefit from taking a prescription drug or may suffer harm from taking an inappropriate drug. d.    It is imperative that step therapy protocols in the State preserve the heath care providers right to make medically necessary treatment decisions in the best interest of the patient. e.     The Legislature declares, therefore, that it is a matter of public interest that the State Health Benefits Program, the School Employers Health Benefits Program, and NJ FamilyCare be required to base step therapy protocols on appropriate clinical practice guidelines or published peer-reviewed data developed by independent experts with knowledge of the condition or conditions under consideration; that patients be exempt from step therapy protocols when those protocols are inappropriate or otherwise not in the best interest of the patients; and that patients have access to a fair, transparent and independent process for requesting an exception to a step therapy protocol when the patients physician deems appropriate. 2.    As used in sections 2 through 6 of this act: "Division" means the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in the Department of Human Services. "Health care provider" means an individual or entity which, acting within the scope of its licensure or certification, provides a covered service.  Health care provider includes, but is not limited to, a physician and other health care professionals licensed pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised Statutes, and a hospital and other health care facilities licensed pursuant to Title 26 of the Revised Statutes. Managed care organization means a health maintenance organization contracted with the division to provide benefits to Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid means the program established pursuant to P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.). Medical necessity" or "medically necessary" means the same as those terms are defined in section 4 of P.L.2023, c.296 (C.17B:30-55.3). Step therapy exception means the overriding of a step therapy protocol in favor of immediate coverage of the health care providers selected prescription drug. Step therapy protocol means a protocol, policy, or program that establishes the specific sequence in which prescription drugs for a specified medical condition, and medically appropriate for a particular patient, are required to be administered in order to be covered by the division or a managed care organization. 3.    a. The division or a managed care organization shall require that clinical review criteria used to establish a step therapy protocol under Medicaid are based on clinical practice guidelines developed by the division, or a managed care organization that: (1)   recommend that the prescription drugs be taken in the specific sequence required by the step therapy protocol; (2)   are developed and endorsed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts that: (a)   relies on objective data; and (b)   manages conflicts of interest among the members by requiring members to disclose any potential conflict of interests with entities, including managed care organizations, carriers, and pharmaceutical manufacturers and recuse themselves from voting if they have a conflict of interest; (3)   are based on high quality studies, research, and medical practice; (4)   are created by an explicit and transparent process that: (a)   minimizes biases and conflicts of interest; (b)   explains the relationship between treatment options and outcomes; (c)   rates the quality of the evidence supporting recommendations; and (d)   considers relevant patient subgroups and preferences; and (5) are reviewed annually or quarterly if there is a new indication or new clinical information available and updated when such review reveals new evidence necessitating modification. b.    In the absence of clinical guidelines that meet the requirements in subsection a. of this section, peer-reviewed publications may be substituted. c.     When establishing a step therapy protocol, the division or managed care organization shall also consider the needs of atypical patient populations and diagnoses when establishing clinical review criteria. d.    A managed care organization shall: (1)   upon written request, provide written clinical review criteria relating to a particular condition or disease, including clinical review criteria relating to a step therapy protocol exception determination; and (2)   make available the clinical review criteria and other clinical information on its internet website and to a health care professional on behalf of an insured person upon written request. e.     This section shall not be construed to require managed care organizations or the State to establish a new entity to develop clinical review criteria used for step therapy protocols. 4.    Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary: a.     When coverage of a prescription drug for the treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use by a managed care organization pursuant to a step therapy protocol, the managed care organization shall provide the enrollee and prescribing practitioner a clear, readily accessible, and convenient process to request a step therapy exception.  A managed care organization may use its existing medical exceptions process to satisfy this requirement.  An explanation of the process shall be made available on the managed care organizations website.  A managed care organization shall disclose all rules and criteria related to the step therapy protocol upon request to all prescribing practitioners, including the specific information and documentation required to be submitted by a prescribing practitioner or patient for an exception request to be complete. b.    A step therapy exception shall be granted if the prescribing health care provider determines that: (1)   the required prescription drug is contraindicated or is likely to cause an adverse reaction or physical or mental harm to the patient; (2)   the required prescription drug is expected to be ineffective or less effective than an alternative based on the known clinical characteristics of the patient and the known characteristics of the prescription drug regimen; or (3)   all formulary drugs used to treat each disease state have been ineffective or less effective than an alternative in the treatment of the enrollee's disease or condition, or all such drugs have caused or are reasonably expected to cause adverse or harmful reactions in the enrollee.
