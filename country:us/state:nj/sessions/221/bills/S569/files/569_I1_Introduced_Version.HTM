The open public records act provides for public access to government records. While the open public records act promotes the Legislatures broad policy in favor of granting access to government records, there are nevertheless exceptions when circumstances warrant exclusion from the requirements of that law. This bill recognizes that such circumstances exist in the case of brave residents of this State offering their talent and sometimes their lives to protect the safety and welfare of their neighbors on a voluntary basis. Though the bill exempts volunteer fire companies and volunteer fire departments from the open public records act, it would not exempt all documents related to those groups, such as, for example, when fire districts themselves are required to maintain the basic documents related to the internal organization and functioning of fire squads in those districts as a part of its oversight of the squads.
