Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section)  a.  At a
residential property, small electric battery storage equipment shall be
considered a permitted accessory use and permitted accessory structure in all
zoning or use districts of a municipality.  The small electric battery storage
equipment installation component of an application for development at a residential
property shall not require a variance pursuant to subsection d. of section 57
of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-70). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  As used in P.L.    , c.   
(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), residential
property means any building being used, or to be used or held for use,
entirely or partially as a home or residence, together with the land upon which
it is situate, including, but not limited to, a single family dwelling, or a multiple
dwelling as defined under subsection (k) of section 3 of the &quot;Hotel and
Multiple Dwelling Law,&quot; P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  (New section)  a.  An
application for development submitted solely for the installation of small
electric battery storage equipment at a commercial or industrial property shall
not be subject to site plan or other land use board review, shall not require
variance relief pursuant to P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) or any other
law, rule, or regulation, and shall be approved through the issuance of a
zoning permit by the administrative officer, provided the application meets the
following requirements:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the proposed installation
does not violate bulk requirements applicable to the property, or the
conditions of the original final approval of the site plan or subsequent
approvals for the existing commercial or industrial property;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  all other conditions of
prior approvals for the existing commercial or industrial establishment, or any
other existing building continue to be met; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  the proposed installation
complies with the construction codes adopted in or promulgated pursuant to the
&quot;State Uniform Construction Code Act,&quot; P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119
et seq.), any safety standards concerning the installation, and any State rule
or regulation concerning small electric battery storage equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  An application for
development submitted solely for the installation of small electric battery
storage equipment at a commercial or industrial property shall be deemed
complete if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the application,
including the permit fee and all necessary documentation, is determined to be
complete;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  a notice of
incompleteness is not provided within 20 days after the filing of the application;
or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  a one-time written
correction notice is not issued by the jurisdiction within 20 days after filing
of the application detailing all deficiencies in the application and
identifying any additional information explicitly necessary to complete a
review of the permit application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  A power company, when
connecting small electric battery storage equipment subject to the approval of
an application submitted pursuant to this section, shall collaborate with
developers and owners, with consultation from the Board of Public Utilities, in
implementing the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  (New section)  a.  (1) 
Within 30 days of enactment of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill), the Commissioner of Community Affairs shall publish
a model ordinance to address installation, sightline, and setback requirements
and other health- and safety-related specifications for small electric battery
storage equipment and shall post the model ordinance on the Internet website of
the Department of Community Affairs.  The model ordinance published by the
commissioner shall not require the rulemaking process pursuant to the
&quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The model ordinance shall
address the requirements of sections 1 through 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.       
through        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The
commissioner may periodically update the small electric battery storage
equipment installation requirements of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill) to reflect advances in electric battery
storage technology.  The commissioner shall update the installation requirements
pursuant to the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410
(C.52:14B-1 et seq.) and promulgate them as amendments to the model ordinance
published pursuant to this subsection.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  (1)  The model ordinance
published by the commissioner pursuant to this section shall be effective in
each municipality, except that a municipality may deviate from the reasonable
standards set forth in the model land use ordinance by adoption of an ordinance
pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  A municipality may, by
ordinance, adopt reasonable standards to address installation, sightline, and
setback requirements or other health- and safety-related specifications for
small electric battery storage equipment.  Nothing in this subsection shall be
deemed to authorize a municipality to require site plan review by a municipal
agency solely for the installation of small electric battery storage equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend and supplement
the Municipal Land Use Law, (MLUL) P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) to
establish limits on how local zoning codes may restrict the installation of
small electric battery storage equipment.  The bill defines small electric
battery storage equipment as the equipment, of up to 25 kilowatts in capacity,
including the cables, cords, conductors, connectors, couplers, enclosures,
attachment plugs, power outlets, power electronics, transformer, switchgear,
switches and controls, network interfaces, and point of sale equipment and
associated apparatus designed and used for the purpose of transferring energy
from the grid or wind, solar or photovoltaic energy facility or structure to
the residential, commercial, or industrial end use.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At a residential property, the
bill would require small electric battery storage equipment to be considered a
permitted accessory use and permitted accessory structure in all zoning or use districts
of a municipality.  Under the bill, the small electric battery storage
equipment installation component of an application for development at a residential
property would not require a use variance, also known as a d. variance. 
Additionally, the bill adjusts the inherently beneficial use definition in
the MLUL to include small electric battery storage equipment, thereby enhancing
the ease of obtaining a variance when needed for certain development.  The bill
defines residential property as any building being used, or to be used or
held for use, entirely or partially as a home or residence, together with the
land upon which it is situated, including, but not limited to, a single family
dwelling, or a multiple dwelling as defined under subsection (k) of section 3
of the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law, P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-3).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, an application
for development submitted solely for the installation of small electric battery
storage equipment at a commercial or industrial property would not be subject
to site plan or other land use board review, and would not require variance
relief.  These development applications would be approved through the issuance
of a zoning permit, provided:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the proposed installation
would not violate bulk requirements of the property, or conditions of the
original final approval of the site plan or subsequent approvals for the
property;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  all other conditions of
prior approvals for the property continue to be met; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  the proposed installation
complies with the &quot;State Uniform Construction Code Act,&quot; P.L.1975, c.217
(C.52:27D-119 et seq.), any safety standards concerning the installation, and
any State rule or regulation concerning small electric battery storage
equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also expressly
establishes standards for when an application for development solely for the
installation of small electric battery storage equipment at a commercial or
industrial property would be deemed complete.  Specifically, the application
would be deemed complete if: (1) the application, including the permit fee and
all necessary documentation, is determined to be complete; (2) a notice of
incompleteness is not provided within 20 days after the filing of the
application; or (3) a one-time written correction notice is not issued by the
jurisdiction within 20 days after filing of the application detailing all
deficiencies and identifying any additional information necessary.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also directs a power
company when connecting certain small electric battery storage equipment, to
collaborate with developers and owners, with consultation from the Board of
Public Utilities, in implementing the requirements of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
Commissioner of Community Affairs, within 30 days of the bills enactment, to publish
a model land use ordinance to address installation, sightline, and setback
requirements and other health- and safety-related specifications for small
electric battery storage equipment.  The model land use ordinance would not
require the rulemaking process pursuant to the &quot;Administrative Procedure
Act.&quot;  The bill authorizes the commissioner to periodically update the
model land use ordinance through the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act&quot;
process.  The model land use ordinance would be effective in all
municipalities., however, the bill authorizes   By ordinance, a municipality
would be authorized to adopt an ordinance deviating from the model land use
ordinance through adoption of if it sets forth reasonable standards to address
installation, sightline, and setback requirements or other health- and
safety-related specifications for small electric battery storage equipment. 
However, the bill would not authorize a municipality to require site plan
review by a municipal agency solely for the installation of small electric
battery storage equipment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would take effect on
the first day of the fifth month next following enactment, except that the
Commissioner of Community Affairs is directed may to take any necessary
anticipatory actions necessary prior to that date for implementation.</p>
