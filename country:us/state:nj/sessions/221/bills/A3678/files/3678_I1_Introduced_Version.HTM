b. of this section determines that the person is eligible for early release on
parole or until expiration of the term of confinement, whichever shall occur
first; except that in no case shall the period of confinement and parole exceed
the maximum provided by law for the offense.  A juvenile shall be granted early
release on parole when it appears that the juvenile has made substantial
progress toward positive behavioral adjustment and rehabilitative goals
articulated by the panel established pursuant to subsection b. of this section
to the juvenile.  However, if a juvenile is approved for parole by the panel
established pursuant to subsection b. of this section prior to serving
one-third of any term imposed for any crime of the first, second, or third
degree, including any extended term imposed pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4) of
this subsection, or one-fourth of any term imposed for any other crime the granting
of parole shall be subject to approval of the sentencing court.  Prior to
approving parole, the court shall give the prosecuting attorney notice and an
opportunity to be heard.  If the court denies the parole of a juvenile pursuant
to this paragraph it shall state its reasons in writing and notify the panel
established pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the juvenile, and the
juvenile's attorney. The court shall have 30 days from the date of notice of
the pending parole to exercise the power granted under this paragraph.  If the
court does not respond within that time period, the parole will be deemed
approved.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The panel established pursuant
to subsection b. of this section shall determine at the time of release the
conditions of parole, which shall be appropriately tailored to the needs of
each juvenile.  Any conditions imposed at the time of release or modified
thereafter as a graduated intervention in lieu of initiating parole revocation
proceedings shall constitute the least restrictive alternatives necessary to
promote the successful return of the juvenile to the community.  The juvenile
shall not be required to enter or complete a residential community release
program, residential treatment program, or other out-of-home placement as a condition
of parole unless it is determined that the condition is necessary to protect
the safety of the juvenile.</p>

P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-20 et seq.) who is released on parole prior to the
expiration of the juvenile's maximum term may be retained under parole
supervision for a period not exceeding the unserved portion of the term. The
panel established pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the juvenile, the
juvenile's attorney, the juvenile's parent or guardian or, with leave of the
court any other interested party, may make a motion to the court, with notice
to the prosecuting attorney, for the return of the juvenile from a juvenile
facility prior to the juvenile's parole and provide for an alternative
disposition which would not exceed the duration of the original time to be
served in the facility.  </p>

prosecutor, the court may sentence a juvenile who has been convicted of a crime
of the first, second, or third degree if committed by an adult, to an extended
term of incarceration beyond the maximum set forth in paragraph (1) of this
subsection, if it finds that the juvenile was previously adjudged delinquent on
at least two separate occasions, for offenses which, if committed by an adult,
would constitute a crime of the first or second degree. The extended term shall
not exceed five additional years for an act which would constitute murder and
shall not exceed three additional years for all other crimes of the first
degree and shall not exceed two additional years for a crime of the second
degree, if committed by an adult, and one additional year for a crime of the
third degree, if committed by an adult. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Upon application by the
prosecutor, when a juvenile is before the court at one time for disposition of
three or more unrelated offenses which, if committed by an adult, would
constitute crimes of the first, second or third degree and which are not part
of the same transaction, the court may sentence the juvenile to an extended
term of incarceration not to exceed the maximum of the permissible term for the
most serious offense for which the juvenile has been adjudicated plus two
additional years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   The panel established
pursuant to subsection b. of this section may impose a term of post-incarceration
supervision following the juvenile's release from custody only if it is deemed
necessary to effectuate the juvenile's rehabilitation and reintegration into
society.  Post-incarceration supervision shall not exceed six months, except
the term may be extended for an additional six months if the panel established
pursuant to subsection b. of this section deems continuation of the
post-incarceration supervision necessary to effectuate the juvenile's
rehabilitation and reintegration into society.  Post-incarceration supervision
shall not exceed one year.  Post-incarceration supervision shall not be imposed
on any juvenile who has completed a period of parole supervision of six months
or more.  The term of post-incarceration supervision shall commence on the date
of the expiration of the juvenile's maximum sentence.  During the term of
post-incarceration supervision the juvenile shall remain in the community and
in the legal custody of the commission.  The juvenile shall not be required to
enter or complete a residential community release program, residential
treatment program, or other out-of-home placement as a condition of
post-incarceration supervision.  A term of post-incarceration supervision
imposed pursuant to this paragraph may be terminated by the panel established
pursuant to subsection b. of this section or court if the juvenile has made a
satisfactory adjustment in the community while under supervision and if
continued supervision is not required. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The commission shall
review the case of each juvenile sentenced to a term of commitment with the
commission at least every three months and submit a status report to the court,
the prosecutor, and the counsel for the juvenile.  The commission's review and
status report shall include, but not be limited to:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   information on the
treatment, care, and custody of the juvenile; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   whether the juvenile is
receiving the mental health, substance abuse, educational, and other
rehabilitative services necessary to promote the juvenile's successful reintegration
into the community; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   any incidents of
violence involving the juvenile; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   the juvenile's
eligibility for parole. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Counsel for the juvenile shall
have the opportunity to respond to the report required pursuant to this
paragraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission shall continue
to submit quarterly reports to the court until the juvenile is paroled or
released at the expiration of the term of incarceration and shall resume the
quarterly reviews if the juvenile is returned to the custody of the commission.
 The court may conduct a hearing at any time to determine whether commitment
with the commission continues to be appropriate pursuant to section 24 of
P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-43) and section 25 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-44), and
may release the juvenile or otherwise modify the dispositional order.  Nothing
in this paragraph shall abrogate the court's retention of jurisdiction pursuant
to section 26 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-45).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     If the panel
established pursuant to subsection b. of this section determines there is
probable cause to believe that the juvenile has seriously or persistently
violated the terms and conditions of parole, the commission shall conduct a
hearing to determine if the juvenile's parole should be revoked.  The juvenile
shall be represented by counsel at the hearing.  The hearing shall be conducted
by a hearing officer who is licensed as an attorney-at-law in this State.  The
juvenile shall not be incarcerated prior to the hearing unless the panel
established pursuant to subsection b. of this section determines by objective
and credible evidence that the juvenile poses an immediate and substantial
danger to public safety.  If the juvenile is incarcerated prior to the hearing,
the hearing shall be held within 72 hours of the juvenile's return to custody
and a written decision made and transmitted to the juvenile and the juvenile's
counsel within 48 hours of the hearing.  Upon request of counsel for the
juvenile, the hearing officer shall adjourn the hearing for not more than 72
hours.  Subsequent adjournments may be granted upon request of the juvenile and
good cause shown.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The panel established pursuant
to subsection b. of this section shall not revoke the parole of a juvenile
unless the hearing officer determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that:</p>

seriously or persistently violated the conditions of parole; </p>

substantial danger to public safety and no form of community-based supervision
would alleviate that danger; and </p>

procedures and standards conflict with those set forth in this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding a
determination that the juvenile violated a condition of parole, the panel
established pursuant to subsection b. of this section may modify those conditions.</p>

assault have increased 38 percent between 1988 and 1993 and New Jersey ranks
near the top nationally in the number of juvenile arrests for serious violent
crimes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Juvenile crime has
become a leading cause of injury and death among young people;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Currently, preventive,
deterrent and rehabilitative services and sanctions for juveniles are the
responsibility of no less than three State departments:  The Department of Law
and Public Safety deals with county prosecutors and local police and implements
prevention programs; the Department of Corrections operates the New Jersey
Training School for Boys and the Juvenile Medium Security Facility, and its
Bureau of Parole supervises juvenile parolees; and the Department of Human
Services operates residential and day programs in facilities for juveniles
adjudicated delinquent;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The division of
responsibility for the juvenile justice population and the limitations on
resources available to meet ever-increasing demands for services provided by
the Departments of Human Services and Corrections have prevented the
departments from maximizing efforts to meet the special needs of the juvenile
justice population;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The juvenile justice
system lacks services and sanctions short of incarceration, particularly in
urban areas and for that reason, many juveniles are not held accountable until
they have committed a series of increasingly serious criminal acts;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The special needs of
juveniles can be addressed through services and sanctions provided at the
county and local level;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The need to protect the
public from criminal acts by juvenile offenders requires a comprehensive
program and concerted action of governmental agencies and private organizations
at the State, county and local level that permit effective response and avoid
waste of scarce resources;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i. (1) The comprehensive
program should provide a range of services and sanctions for juveniles
sufficient to protect the public through prevention; early intervention; and a
range of meaningful sanctions that ensure accountability, provide training,
education, treatment and, when necessary, confinement followed by community
supervision that is adequate to protect the public and promote successful
reintegration into the community;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Consistent with the need
to protect the public, services and sanctions for juveniles shall provide
balanced attention to the protection of the community, the imposition of
accountability for offenses committed, fostering interaction and dialogue
between the offender, victim and community and the development of competencies
to enable juvenile offenders to become responsible and productive members of
the community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     The most efficient and
effective use of available resources requires fixing responsibility for the
comprehensive program in a single State agency and providing incentives to
encourage the development and provision of appropriate services and sanctions
at the county and local level; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    It is, therefore,
necessary to establish a <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>Juvenile<b><span
