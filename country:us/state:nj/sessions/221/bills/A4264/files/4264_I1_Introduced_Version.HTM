the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  As used in sections 1
through 6 of P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this
bill): </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Multi-sport student-athlete
means a student-athlete participating in more than one Statewide
interscholastic sports program, intramural sports program, or cheerleading
program.                 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Season means the time that a
student-athlete participates in activities associated with a Statewide
interscholastic sports program, intramural sports program, or cheerleading
program organized pursuant to  section 1 of P.L.1979, c.172 (C.18A:11-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Student-athlete means any
student enrolled in a public school in this State who is a participant in an
interscholastic sports program or intramural sports program organized by the
school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  A school district that
is a member of any voluntary association, pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1979,
c.172 (C.18A:11-3), which oversees activities associated with a Statewide
interscholastic sports program, intramural sports program, or cheerleading
program shall appoint a student-athlete mental health specialist. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) The school district may
appoint a school guidance counselor, school psychologist, or another individual
similarly trained that is currently employed in the school district as the
student-athlete mental health specialist provided that individual is a
State-licensed or State-certified mental health professional qualified pursuant
to State law to provide mental health services to children and adolescents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) If no individual meeting
this criteria is currently employed by the school district, the district shall
appoint an individual that is a State-certified school counselor, school
psychologist, school social worker, or other State-licensed or State-certified
mental health professional qualified pursuant to State law to provide mental
health services to children and adolescents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) An individual appointed as

(C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and hold a current
certification in Mental Health First Aid from the National Council for Mental
Wellness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The  student-athlete
mental health specialist shall identify mental health stressors affecting
student-athletes, monitor student-athletes mental wellness, and provide
student-athletes, coaches, athletic trainers, and school physicians with mental
health resources. The student-athlete mental health specialist shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  meet with each
student-athlete three times during the student-athletes season for the purpose
of conducting a mental health screening.  The student-athlete mental health
specialist shall meet with multi-sport student-athletes three times during each
season of participation in an interscholastic sports program, intramural sports
program, or cheerleading program;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  a research-based
screening tool shall be used to conduct the screening.  Nothing in this
subsection shall prohibit a student-athlete mental health specialist from using
a self-administered screening tool as part of the screening. The screening
shall include an analysis of the student-athletes mental state, monitor a
student-athletes academics, and detect any changes from previous screenings; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  pursuant to the
provisions of P.L.2001, c.364 (C.18A:36-34), the student-athlete mental health
specialist shall obtain written informed consent from a student-athletes
parent or guardian prior to the screening in a manner and form as prescribed by
the Department of Education; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)  a parent or guardian of a
student-athlete may submit a written statement to the student-athlete mental
health specialist to waive a student-athlete from the screening requirement;
and   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)  if a student-athletes
parent or guardian has not provided informed consent pursuant to subsection (b)
or submitted a written statement pursuant to subsection (c), the
student-athlete shall be prohibited from participation in any interscholastic
sports program, intramural sports program, or cheerleading program conducted
pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1979, c.172 (C.18A:11-3);          </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  meet weekly with any
student-athlete that has sustained an injury that prevents participation in the
interscholastic sports program, intramural sports program, or cheerleading
program.  The weekly meetings shall continue until the student-athlete has been
evaluated and receives written clearance from a licensed physician to
participate in the athletic activity; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) annually submit data
collected from the screenings for each student-athlete to the department in a
form and manner to be determined by the department, provided that any data
forwarded shall be aggregated and shall not contain any identifying or
confidential information with regard to any student-athlete as required under
section 5 of P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this
bill); and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  develop a student-athlete
mental health policy for consideration and adoption by the board of education. 
The policy shall be for use by a school physician; a person who coaches a
public school district interscholastic sport, intramural sport, or cheerleading
program; an athletic trainer involved in a public school interscholastic sports

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
appointment of student-athlete mental health specialists at public school
districts and public institutions of higher education. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a school
district that is a voluntary member of the New Jersey State Interscholastic
Athletic Association (NJSIAA) is required to appoint a student-athlete mental
health specialist. A school district may appoint a school guidance counselor,
school psychologist, or another individual similarly trained that is already
employed by the district if the individual is a State-licensed or
State-certified mental health professional. A school district also has an
option under the bill to hire a State-licensed or State-certified mental health
professional to fill this position. A person appointed to the student-athlete
mental health specialist position is required to obtain certification in Mental
Health First Aid and complete the Student-Athlete Mental Health Specialist
Certification every two years. The bill requires the Department of Education
to develop the certification program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Similarly, a public
institution of higher education is required to appoint two student-athlete
mental health specialists with individuals that are State-certified or
State-licensed mental health professionals. A student-athlete mental health
specialist at a public institution of higher education is also required to
obtain certification in Mental Health First Aid and complete the
Student-Athlete Mental Health Specialist Certification from the Office of the
Secretary of Higher Education every two years. The secretary is required to
develop the certification program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the
student-athlete mental health specialist is required to screen each student-athlete,
provide mental health support to student-athletes, and monitor the impact of
sports-related injuries on student-athletes mental health.  At public
institutions of higher education, the two student-athlete mental health
specialists are also required to be easily accessible to student-athletes
during the academic year and have on-campus offices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A student-athlete in high
school or attending a public institution of higher education has the option to
waive the screening requirement by submitting a written statement to the
student-athlete mental health specialist. However, if the student-athlete
refuses the screening but does not submit a written statement, the
student-athlete will be prohibited from participating in the organized sport. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, a
student-athlete mental health specialist, at both the high school and college
levels, is responsible for the creation of a student-athlete mental health
policy that: 1) recognizes the symptoms of mental health disorders that may
affect student-athletes; 2) establishes mental health screening tools; 3)
provides guidance on techniques for reducing stressors; 4) establishes
protocols for non-emergent mental health referrals and emergent mental health
situations; 5) creates a plan for transition care for students-athletes that
leave the program; and 6) lists additional mental health resources and
organizations that a student-athlete can consult for additional services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the department
is required to establish a central registry of the aggregated screening data
collected by a student-athlete mental health specialist for student-athletes in
each school district. The secretary is required to create and maintain a
similar registry from the aggregate data collected for student-athletes at public
institutions of higher education. The purpose of these registries are to determine
the stressors, rates, patterns, and trends of mental health disorders in student-athletes
in order to develop evidence-based detection, prevention, and intervention protocols. 
The bill stipulates that, in establishing both registries, the department and
secretary are required to ensure that any student identifying information
remains confidential.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill,
student-athlete mental health specialists are not subject to liability for
exercising their judgment or discretion in connection with the performance of
their duties or for any good faith act or omission related to the requirements
set forth in the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill makes an appropriation
from the General Fund to the department for the costs of implementing the
provisions affecting high school student-athletes and to the secretary for the
costs associated with implementing the provisions affecting college-aged
student-athletes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The student-athlete mental
health specialist position is created at the high school and college levels to
improve student-athlete mental wellness. It is the intent of this bill to
address mental health issues that affect high school and college
student-athletes. Studies have indicated that student-athletes are less likely
than their non-athlete peers to seek counseling and other professional help
services. This bill seeks to remove the stigma of seeking mental health
services by requiring the student-athlete mental health specialist to routinely
meet with  student-athletes, provide mental health support to student-athletes,
and monitor the impact of sports-related injuries on student-athletes mental
health. </p>
