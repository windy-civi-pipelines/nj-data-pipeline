STATEMENT This bill provides a supplemental appropriation of $106.5 million from the Property Tax Relief Fund to the Department of Education to provide Emergency Supplemental Aid to certain school districts.  The aid is to be distributed to school districts that have been allocated a total amount of State school aid in the 2024-2025 school year that is: · less than the districts adequacy budget, which under current law represents the portion of the costs that a school district is expected to incur to provide a thorough and efficient education; and · less than or equal to $19,000 per resident pupil; and · either: less than or equal to the total amount of State school aid allocated to the district in the 2023-2024 school year; or greater than the total amount of State school aid allocated to the district in the 2023-2024 school year by up to $200,000. The amount of Emergency Supplemental Aid provided to an eligible district pursuant to the bill is to be determined by multiplying $250 by the number of resident pupils in the district. School districts from all parts of the State have experienced negative budgetary effects over the seven years following the enactment of P.L.2018, c.67, commonly referred to as S2.  The severity of these budgetary reductions have forced districts to lay off hundreds of teachers and staff, adopt half-day schedules, eliminate sports and clubs, reduce academic programming such as Advanced Placement classes, eliminate busing, and sell land and close schools just to balance their budgets.  This educational funding crisis has affected hundreds of school districts representing an array of socioeconomic groups, from urban districts such as the City of East Orange, Jersey City, and Passaic City, to suburban districts such as Hillsborough Township, Freehold Regional School District, Old Bridge Township, Jackson Township, Toms River Regional School District, Brick Township, and Evesham Township, and extending to rural districts, such as Chesterfield Township, Lenape Regional School District, Estell Manor City, and Hardyston Township.  This bill provides emergency restoration aid to help stabilize the budgets of these school districts, as well as 290 other districts, for the purpose of providing these children with a quality education.
