S3270 SENATE, No. 3270 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 16, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  DECLAN J. O'SCANLON, JR. District 13 (Monmouth) SYNOPSIS Permits public high school student-athletes to opt out of physical education during their athletic seasons. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning physical education instruction in public high schools and supplementing chapter 35 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.18A:35-7, N.J.S.18A:35-8, or any other law to the contrary, a public high school student who participates in a school-sponsored sport and is scheduled to attend a physical education course during the athletic season of that sport may elect to substitute the physical education course with a study hall during that athletic season.  The students participation in the sport shall count towards the students physical education requirement for graduation, and the student shall receive the number of high school graduation credits equal to the number received for completion of the physical education course. 2.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall first apply to the 2024-2025 school year. STATEMENT This bill permits a public high school student who participates in a school-sponsored sport and is scheduled to attend a physical education course during the athletic season of that sport to substitute the physical education course with a study hall.  The student who chooses to substitute the physical education course with a study hall is to receive for participation in the sport the number of high school graduation credits equal to the number received for completion of the physical education course. This bill does not exempt students from the statutory requirement that they attend at least two and one-half hours per school week of health and safety education courses, when these courses are scheduled.  This bill also does not affect the physical education requirement for students in grades one through eight or for high school students who do not participate in school-sponsored sports. It is the sponsors belief that high school student athletes are meeting the statutory physical education requirements by their participation in school-sponsored sports.  These same student athletes are in need of additional time to devote to their academic studies and preparation for post-secondary education. It is the intent of this bill to provide these students additional time during the school day to address their educational needs.
