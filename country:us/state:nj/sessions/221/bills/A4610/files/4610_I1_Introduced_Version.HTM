<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In light of the exponentially
greater risk of injury and damage caused by crowd-based destructive behavior,
this omnibus bill addresses certain crimes committed during the course of riot
or crowd-based behavior.  Presently, under N.J.S.A.2C:33-1, a person is guilty
of riot if he participates with four or more others in a course of disorderly
conduct with an unlawful purpose, enumerated in the statute.  This bill amends
N.J.S.A.2C:33-1 to expand the categories of unlawful purposes to include when
the actor, with six or more others, causes damage to property or injury to
another.  Riot under these circumstances is a crime of the fourth degree
punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends
N.J.S.A.2C:33-2, Disorderly Conduct, which currently provides that a person
commits a petty disorderly persons offense if he commits certain prohibited
acts.  This bill creates a new subsection c. to provide that a person commits a
crime of the fourth degree if, during a riot, he engages in disorderly conduct
in a place of public accommodation, resort or amusement.  Under the bill,
Place of public accommodation, resort or amusement includes any inn, tavern,
road house or hotel, whether for entertainment of transient guests or accommodation
of those seeking  health, recreation or rest; any restaurant, eating house, or
place where food is sold for consumption on the premises; any place maintained
for sale of ice cream, ice and fruit preparations or their derivatives, soda
water or confections, or where any beverages of any kind are retailed for
consumption on the premises; any garage, any public conveyance operated on land
or water, and  stations and terminals thereof; any public bathhouse, public
boardwalk, public seashore accommodation; any theater, or other place of public
amusement, motion-picture house, airdrome, music hall, roof garden, skating
rink, amusement and recreation park, fair, bowling alley, gymnasium, shooting gallery,
billiard and pool parlor; any dispensary, clinic, hospital, public  library,
kindergarten, primary and secondary school, high school, academy, college and
university, or any educational institution under the supervision of  the
regents of the State of New Jersey.  Under these circumstances, the offense is
a crime of the fourth degree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends
N.J.S.A.2C:33-7, Obstructing highways and other public passages, to elevate the
offense to a crime of the fourth degree if a person, who, having no legal
privilege to do so, purposely or recklessly obstructs any highway or other
public passage in the course of committing riot or disorderly conduct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends N.J.S.2C:33-9,
Desecration of venerated objects, to elevate the offense to a crime of the
fourth degree if the desecration occurs during a riot.  The term desecrate is
clarified to include conduct such as actual destruction or the toppling of a
monument.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends N.J.S.2C:12-1,
Assault.  Currently, the statute enumerates the circumstances when aggravated
assault occurs; this bill adds the additional circumstance.  Under the bill, a
person is guilty of aggravated assault if he attempts to cause or purposely,
knowingly or recklessly causes bodily injury to another in the course of a
riot.  Aggravated assault under this circumstance is a crime of the third
degree, punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to
$15,000, or both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, paragraph (5) of
subsection b. of N.J.S.A.2C:12-1 elevates simple assault to aggravated assault
when committed against certain categories of persons, including when committed
against a law enforcement officer acting in the performance of the officers
duties while in uniform or exhibiting evidence of authority or because of the
officers status as a law enforcement officer, and is graded as a crime of the
third degree.  Under the bill, if, in the course of a riot, an object is thrown
at a law enforcement officer, or if the law enforcement officer is struck,
whether or not with an object, the presumption of non-imprisonment for a first
offense of a crime of the third degree shall not apply, and a mandatory period
of six months imprisonment shall apply.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill creates the new crime
of promotion of violent, disorderly assembly.  A person promotes violent,

N.J.S.2C:39-5; or N.J.S.2C:39-9 in the course of a riot or at the site of a
peaceable assembly.  Promotion of violent, disorderly assembly is a crime of
