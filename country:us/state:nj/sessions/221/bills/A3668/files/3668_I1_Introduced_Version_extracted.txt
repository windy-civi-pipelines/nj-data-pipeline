The bill provides that coverage is not subject to step therapy or fail-first protocols. Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone, are medications that are used to treat chronic pain. This bill seeks to make these medications more readily available for people with chronic pain by prohibiting health insurers from applying step therapy or fail-first protocols as a condition for coverage.  These protocols are a type of prior authorization which currently may be used by health insurers to require patients to use riskier, more addictive drugs for the treatment of pain, before using buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone, which are less addictive and less likely to be abused by patients.
