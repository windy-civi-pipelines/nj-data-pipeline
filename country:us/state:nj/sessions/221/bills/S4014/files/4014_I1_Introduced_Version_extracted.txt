The bill prohibits a person from impersonating a licensed EMR or EMT or certified MAVO and provides certain immunity from civil damages to EMRs and MAVOs. The bill revises current law and provides the commissioner the authority to summarily suspend a person's mobile intensive care paramedic, EMT, or EMR license or MAVO certification when, in the commissioners opinion, the continued licensure or certification of that person poses an immediate or serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare.  A person whose license or certification has been summarily suspended will have the right to apply for emergency relief.  The commissioner may issue a formal written warning, impose a monetary penalty, place on probation, suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or renew the license of any mobile intensive care paramedic, EMR, or EMT, or the certification of any MAVO, for violation of any of the rules adopted by the department pursuant to the bill.  Under current law, the commissioner is required to provide certain notice and hearing before revoking the license or certification of certain emergency medical service providers. The bill establishes certain staffing requirements for specialty care transport units, mobile intensive care units, basic life support units for emergent response, and mobility assistance vehicles.  The bill requires all crewmembers to hold the appropriate license or certification as determined by the commissioner. The bill requires each mobility assistance vehicle service provider, specialty care transport unit, and basic life support unit used for non-emergent medical transportation to complete and submit to the department an electronic patient care report for each patient encounter in which the patient received nonemergency health care transportation services.  The commissioner will establish, by regulation, requirements for: (1) the collection of data that is to be obtained from each patient encounter; (2) the creation and use of the patient care report to provide the data in electronic form to the receiving facility in a timely manner; and (3) the electronic reporting of this data to the department.  The department will develop and maintain an electronic record of the patient data reported and will make such non-identifying patient data available for research purposes, in accordance with guidelines to be established by the commissioner and subject to the requirements and restrictions of State and federal law and regulations. The bill requires each hospital transfer center in the State to provide data concerning patient referrals and transfers upon request by the department. The bill requires the department to conduct a study on the quality of emergency medical services care and workforce in the State and to prepare and submit a written report to the Governor and Legislature. The bill establishes certain penalties for the violation of laws contained in chapter 2K of Title 26 of the Revised Statutes. The bill repeals P.L.1985, c.351 (C.26:2K-21 through C.26:2K-34) and P.L.1989, c.214 (C.26:2K-39 through C.26:2K-47), which establish EMT designations that are no longer used in current practice.

The commissioner will license or certify a candidate who provides satisfactory evidence of the successful completion of an educational program approved by the commissioner for the training of EMRs, EMTs, or MAVOs, as applicable, and who passes an examination approved by the department for the licensure.  The commissioner may also license applicants for EMT or EMT licensure who have certain equivalent military training or experience. The bill prohibits a person from impersonating a licensed EMR or EMT or certified MAVO and provides certain immunity from civil damages to EMRs and MAVOs. The bill revises current law and provides the commissioner the authority to summarily suspend a person's mobile intensive care paramedic, EMT, or EMR license or MAVO certification when, in the commissioners opinion, the continued licensure or certification of that person poses an immediate or serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare.  A person whose license or certification has been summarily suspended will have the right to apply for emergency relief.  The commissioner may issue a formal written warning, impose a monetary penalty, place on probation, suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or renew the license of any mobile intensive care paramedic, EMR, or EMT, or the certification of any MAVO, for violation of any of the rules adopted by the department pursuant to the bill.  Under current law, the commissioner is required to provide certain notice and hearing before revoking the license or certification of certain emergency medical service providers. The bill establishes certain staffing requirements for specialty care transport units, mobile intensive care units, basic life support units for emergent response, and mobility assistance vehicles.  The bill requires all crewmembers to hold the appropriate license or certification as determined by the commissioner.

The bill requires each hospital transfer center in the State to provide data concerning patient referrals and transfers upon request by the department. The bill requires the department to conduct a study on the quality of emergency medical services care and workforce in the State and to prepare and submit a written report to the Governor and Legislature. The bill establishes certain penalties for the violation of laws contained in chapter 2K of Title 26 of the Revised Statutes.
