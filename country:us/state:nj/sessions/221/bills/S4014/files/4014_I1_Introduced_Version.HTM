<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides for the
licensure of emergency medical responders (EMRs) and emergency medical
technicians (EMTs) and the certification of mobility assistance vehicle
operators (MAVOs) by the Department of Health (department), makes various
changes to the regulation of emergency medical services in the State, and
establishes reporting requirements for certain health care providers providing or
coordinating certain transportation services for patients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires EMRs and EMTs
to be licensed and MAVOs to be certified by the department in order to provide
emergency medical services and mobility assistance vehicle services,
respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Commissioner of Health (commissioner)
will establish written standards and application procedures for the licensure
of EMRs, EMTs and the certification of MAVOs.  The commissioner will also
establish written standards for the licensure of EMTs and EMRs by reciprocity. 
The commissioner will license or certify a candidate who provides satisfactory
evidence of the successful completion of an educational program approved by the
commissioner for the training of EMRs, EMTs, or MAVOs, as applicable, and who
passes an examination approved by the department for the licensure.  The
commissioner may also license applicants for EMT or EMT licensure who have
certain equivalent military training or experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits a person
from impersonating a licensed EMR or EMT or certified MAVO and provides certain
immunity from civil damages to EMRs and MAVOs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill revises current law
and provides the commissioner the authority to summarily suspend a person's
mobile intensive care paramedic, EMT, or EMR license or MAVO certification
when, in the commissioners opinion, the continued licensure or certification
of that person poses an immediate or serious threat to the public health,
safety or welfare.  A person whose license or certification has been summarily
suspended will have the right to apply for emergency relief.  The commissioner
may issue a formal written warning, impose a monetary penalty, place on probation,
suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or renew the license of any mobile
intensive care paramedic, EMR, or EMT, or the certification of any MAVO, for
violation of any of the rules adopted by the department pursuant to the bill.  Under
current law, the commissioner is required to provide certain notice and hearing
before revoking the license or certification of certain emergency medical
service providers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.2in;line-height:150%'>The bill establishes
certain staffing requirements for specialty care transport units, mobile
intensive care units, basic life support units for emergent response, and
mobility assistance vehicles.  The bill requires all crewmembers to hold the
appropriate license or certification as determined by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires each
mobility assistance vehicle service provider, specialty care transport unit,
and basic life support unit used for non-emergent medical transportation to
complete and submit to the department an electronic patient care report for
each patient encounter in which the patient received nonemergency health care transportation
services.  The commissioner will establish, by regulation, requirements for: 
(1) the collection of data that is to be obtained from each patient encounter;
(2) the creation and use of the patient care report to provide the data in
electronic form to the receiving facility in a timely manner; and (3) the
electronic reporting of this data to the department.  The department will
develop and maintain an electronic record of the patient data reported and will
make such non-identifying patient data available for research purposes, in
accordance with guidelines to be established by the commissioner and subject to
the requirements and restrictions of State and federal law and regulations.</p>

hospital transfer center in the State to provide data concerning patient
referrals and transfers upon request by the department.</p>

department to conduct a study on the quality of emergency medical services care
and workforce in the State and to prepare and submit a written report to the
Governor and Legislature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes certain
penalties for the violation of laws contained in chapter 2K of Title 26 of the
Revised Statutes.</p>
