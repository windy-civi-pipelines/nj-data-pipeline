An operator may use substitutions if allowed and as indicated in the manual.  An operator shall ensure that anchors are protected to prevent any public hazard. An operator shall use stakes or ballast at every anchorage point, which shall be installed pursuant to manufacturer requirements.  An operator shall use stakes with restraining hooks or collars at the top to prevent the attached rope from sliding up and releasing.  Ground stakes shall be a minimum of 40 inches long for slides 15 feet or higher. 5.    a.   An operator shall evacuate all riders and deflate the inflatable ride in the event of any approaching hazardous weather related condition.  After the weather condition passes, the operator shall dry the inflatable ride of rainwater, and re-inflate and re-inspect the inflatable ride.  Riders shall be readmitted only when the inflatable ride is deemed safe to operate. b.    An operator shall not operate an inflatable ride if the wind velocity exceeds the manufacturers recommended maximum safe operating wind speed. 6.    The Commissioner of Community Affairs shall adopt rules and regulations, including requirements related to inspection and testing of inflatable rides, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to effectuate the purposes of this act. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately.
