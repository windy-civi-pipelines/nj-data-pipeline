In imposing this disposition and in deciding the duration of the postponement, suspension, or revocation, the court shall consider the circumstances of the act for which the juvenile was adjudicated delinquent and the potential effect of the loss of driving privileges on the juvenile's ability to be rehabilitated.  Any postponement, suspension, or revocation shall be imposed consecutively with any custodial commitment; (18) Order that the juvenile satisfy any other conditions reasonably related to the rehabilitation of the juvenile; (19) Order a parent or guardian who has failed or neglected to exercise reasonable supervision or control of a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent to make restitution to any person or entity who has suffered a loss as a result of that offense and participate in the restitution process.  The court may determine the reasonable amount, terms, and conditions of restitution; [or] (20) Place the juvenile, if eligible, in an appropriate juvenile offender program established pursuant to P.L.1997, c.81 (C.30:8-61 et al.); or (21) In the case of a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful possession of a weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5 or possession of a prohibited weapon or device pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-3, place the juvenile in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential reengagement center program and order the parent or guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings conducted as part of this placement. As used in this section, reengagement center means a facility that provides counseling, direct career placement services, self-improvement programs, school assistance, resources for enrolling in college preparation courses or vocational training, extracurricular activities, and information to assist the juvenile with re-enrolling in a high school or a General Educational Development (GED) program and that gives the juvenile an opportunity to reconnect with the community for the purpose of rehabilitation and prevention of future unlawful activity. c.     (1) If the county in which the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent has a juvenile detention facility meeting the physical and program standards established pursuant to this subsection by the Juvenile Justice Commission, the court may, in addition to any of the dispositions not involving placement out of the home enumerated in this section, incarcerate the juvenile in the youth detention facility in that county for a term not to exceed 60 consecutive days.  The decision by the court to incarcerate a juvenile shall be made in accordance with subsection i. of section 2 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-21).  Counties which do not operate their own juvenile detention facilities may contract for the use of approved commitment programs with counties with which they have established agreements for the use of pre-disposition juvenile detention facilities.  The Juvenile Justice Commission shall promulgate such rules and regulations from time to time as deemed necessary to establish minimum physical facility and program standards for the use of juvenile detention facilities pursuant to this subsection. (2)   A juvenile shall not be incarcerated in any county detention facility unless the county has entered into an agreement with the Juvenile Justice Commission concerning the use of the facility for sentenced juveniles. Upon agreement with the county, the Juvenile Justice Commission shall certify detention facilities which may receive juveniles sentenced pursuant to this subsection and shall specify the capacity of the facility that may be made available to receive such juveniles; provided, however, that in no event shall the number of juveniles incarcerated pursuant to this subsection exceed 50% of the maximum capacity of the facility. (3)   The court may fix a term of incarceration under this subsection that is in accordance with subsection i. of section 2 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-21) and: (a)   The act for which the juvenile was adjudicated delinquent, if committed by an adult, would have constituted a crime or repetitive disorderly persons offense; (b)   Incarceration of the juvenile is consistent with the goals of public safety, accountability, and rehabilitation and the court is clearly convinced that the aggravating factors substantially outweigh the mitigating factors as set forth in section 25 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-44); and (c)   The detention facility has been certified for admission of adjudicated juveniles pursuant to paragraph (2). (4)   If as a result of incarceration of adjudicated juveniles pursuant to this subsection, a county is required to transport a predisposition juvenile to a juvenile detention facility in another county, the costs of such transportation shall be borne by the Juvenile Justice Commission. d.    Whenever the court imposes a disposition upon an adjudicated delinquent which requires the juvenile to perform a community service, restitution, or to participate in any other program provided for in this section other than subsection c., the duration of the juvenile's mandatory participation in such alternative programs shall extend for a period consistent with the program goal for the juvenile and shall in no event exceed one year beyond the maximum duration permissible for the delinquent if the juvenile had been committed to a term of incarceration. e.     In addition to any disposition the court may impose pursuant to this section or section 25 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-44), the following orders shall be included in dispositions of the adjudications set forth below: (1)   An order to perform community service pursuant to paragraph (10) of subsection b. of this section for a period of at least 60 days, if the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of theft of a motor vehicle, or the crime of unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:20-10, or the third degree crime of eluding in violation of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:29-2; and (2)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) (3)   An order to perform community service pursuant to paragraph (10) of subsection b. of this section for a period of at least 30 days, if the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the fourth degree crime of unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:20-10. (4)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) f.  (1) (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) (2)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) (3)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) g.    Whenever the court imposes a disposition upon an adjudicated delinquent which requires the juvenile to perform a community service, restitution, or to participate in any other program provided for in this section, the order shall include provisions which provide balanced attention to the protection of the community, accountability for offenses committed, fostering interaction and dialogue between the offender, victim, and community and the development of competencies to enable the child to become a responsible and productive member of the community. (cf: P.L.2021, c.342, s.1) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill concerns juveniles who are charged with or adjudicated delinquent for certain firearms offenses. Under current law, a judge or court intake officer is required to consider and where appropriate, use certain alternatives to placing a juvenile who has been charged with certain offenses in a juvenile detention facility.  In addition to those alternatives set forth under current law, this bill includes the following as alternatives to placing a juvenile in detention: 1) in the case of a juvenile who has been charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful possession of a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon or device, placement in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential reengagement center program and a requirement for the parent or guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings conducted as part of this placement; and 2) in the case of a juvenile who has been charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime of the first, second, or third degree, or one of the following fourth degree crimes: aggravated assault, stalking, criminal sexual contact, bias intimidation, failure to control or report a dangerous fire, possession of a prohibited weapon or device or unlawful possession of a weapon subsequent to being charged with an offense, which, if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful possession of a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon or device, placement in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential reengagement center program and a requirement for the parent or guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings and participate in programs conducted as part of this placement. In both cases, a parent or guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, is required to provide written assurance that the juvenile and the parent, guardian, or appointed court official, as appropriate, will appear at the next hearing. In addition, under current law, if a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent, the court, in accordance with certain principles, may order incarceration of the juvenile or may order certain other enumerated dispositions.  Under this bill, in addition to the dispositions set forth under current law, the court may also order the following disposition: in the case of a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent for an act, which if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful possession of a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon or device, place the juvenile in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential reengagement center program and order the parent or guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings conducted as part of this placement. Further, under current law, one of the enumerated dispositions that a judge may order is a requirement for a parent or guardian of the juvenile to make restitution in certain cases. This bill clarifies that the parent or guardian is also required to participate in the restitution process. Under the bill, reengagement center is defined as a facility that provides counseling, direct career placement services, self-improvement programs, school assistance, resources for enrolling in college preparation courses or vocational training, extracurricular activities, and information to assist the juvenile with re-enrolling in a high school or a General Educational Development (GED) program and that gives the juvenile an opportunity to reconnect with the community for the purpose of rehabilitation and prevention of future unlawful activity.

In imposing this disposition and in deciding the duration of the postponement, suspension, or revocation, the court shall consider the circumstances of the act for which the juvenile was adjudicated delinquent and the potential effect of the loss of driving privileges on the juvenile's ability to be rehabilitated.  Any postponement, suspension, or revocation shall be imposed consecutively with any custodial commitment; (18) Order that the juvenile satisfy any other conditions reasonably related to the rehabilitation of the juvenile; (19) Order a parent or guardian who has failed or neglected to exercise reasonable supervision or control of a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent to make restitution to any person or entity who has suffered a loss as a result of that offense and participate in the restitution process.  The court may determine the reasonable amount, terms, and conditions of restitution; [or] (20) Place the juvenile, if eligible, in an appropriate juvenile offender program established pursuant to P.L.1997, c.81 (C.30:8-61 et al.); or (21) In the case of a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful possession of a weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5 or possession of a prohibited weapon or device pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-3, place the juvenile in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential reengagement center program and order the parent or guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings conducted as part of this placement.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.342, s.1) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill concerns juveniles who are charged with or adjudicated delinquent for certain firearms offenses. Under current law, a judge or court intake officer is required to consider and where appropriate, use certain alternatives to placing a juvenile who has been charged with certain offenses in a juvenile detention facility.  In addition to those alternatives set forth under current law, this bill includes the following as alternatives to placing a juvenile in detention: 1) in the case of a juvenile who has been charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful possession of a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon or device, placement in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential reengagement center program and a requirement for the parent or guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings conducted as part of this placement; and 2) in the case of a juvenile who has been charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime of the first, second, or third degree, or one of the following fourth degree crimes: aggravated assault, stalking, criminal sexual contact, bias intimidation, failure to control or report a dangerous fire, possession of a prohibited weapon or device or unlawful possession of a weapon subsequent to being charged with an offense, which, if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful possession of a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon or device, placement in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential reengagement center program and a requirement for the parent or guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings and participate in programs conducted as part of this placement. In both cases, a parent or guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, is required to provide written assurance that the juvenile and the parent, guardian, or appointed court official, as appropriate, will appear at the next hearing. In addition, under current law, if a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent, the court, in accordance with certain principles, may order incarceration of the juvenile or may order certain other enumerated dispositions.  Under this bill, in addition to the dispositions set forth under current law, the court may also order the following disposition: in the case of a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent for an act, which if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful possession of a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon or device, place the juvenile in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential reengagement center program and order the parent or guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings conducted as part of this placement. Further, under current law, one of the enumerated dispositions that a judge may order is a requirement for a parent or guardian of the juvenile to make restitution in certain cases. This bill clarifies that the parent or guardian is also required to participate in the restitution process. Under the bill, reengagement center is defined as a facility that provides counseling, direct career placement services, self-improvement programs, school assistance, resources for enrolling in college preparation courses or vocational training, extracurricular activities, and information to assist the juvenile with re-enrolling in a high school or a General Educational Development (GED) program and that gives the juvenile an opportunity to reconnect with the community for the purpose of rehabilitation and prevention of future unlawful activity.
