<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     15.  Criteria for placing
juvenile in detention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Except as otherwise
provided in this section, a juvenile charged with an act of delinquency shall
be released pending the disposition of a case, if any, to any person or agency
provided for in this section upon assurance being received that such person or
persons accept responsibility for the juvenile and will bring him before the
court as ordered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    No juvenile shall be
placed in detention without the permission of a judge or the court intake
service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A juvenile charged with
delinquency may not be placed or retained in detention under this act prior to
disposition, except as otherwise provided by law, unless:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Detention is necessary
to secure the presence of the juvenile at the next hearing as evidenced by a demonstrable
record of recent willful failure to appear at juvenile court proceedings or to
remain where placed by the court or the court intake service or the juvenile is
subject to a current warrant for failure to appear at court proceedings which
is active at the time of arrest; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The physical safety of
persons or property of the community would be seriously threatened if the

third degree or one of the following crimes of the fourth degree:  aggravated
assault; stalking; criminal sexual contact; bias intimidation; failure to

juvenile charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, would
constitute a crime of the fourth degree other than those enumerated in
paragraph (2) of this subsection, or a disorderly persons or petty disorderly
persons offense, and with respect to a juvenile charged with an offense
enumerated in subsection c. when the criteria for detention are not met, the
juvenile may be temporarily placed in a shelter or other non-secure placement
if a parent or guardian cannot be located or will not accept custody of the
juvenile.  Police and court intake personnel shall make all reasonable efforts
to locate a parent or guardian to accept custody of the juvenile prior to
requesting or approving the juvenile's placement in a shelter or other
non-secure placement.  If, after the initial detention hearing, continued
placement is necessary, the juvenile shall be returned to a shelter or other
non-secure placement.</p>

enrolling in college preparation courses or vocational training, extracurricular
activities, and information to assist the juvenile with re-enrolling in a high

rehabilitation and prevention of future unlawful activity. </u></p>

section, a failure to appear at juvenile court proceedings or to remain where
placed by the court or the court intake service shall be deemed recent if it

hearing and the juvenile is unable to demonstrate a record of voluntary
compliance with any subsequent court appearance and placement requirements.</p>

cause shown, but not later than 30 days, the Department of Children and
Families shall submit to the court a service plan, which shall be presumed
valid, detailing the specifics of any disposition order.  The plan shall be

who are charged with or adjudicated delinquent for certain firearms offenses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a judge or
court intake officer is required to consider and where appropriate, use certain
alternatives to placing a juvenile who has been charged with certain offenses
in a juvenile detention facility.  In addition to those alternatives set forth
under current law, this bill includes the following as alternatives to placing
a juvenile in detention: 1) in the case of a juvenile who has been charged with
an offense which, if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful
possession of a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon or device,
placement in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential
reengagement center program and a requirement for the parent or guardian of the
juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings
conducted as part of this placement; and 2) in the case of a juvenile who has
been charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, would constitute
a crime of the first, second, or third degree, or one of the following fourth
degree crimes: aggravated assault, stalking, criminal sexual contact, bias
intimidation, failure to control or report a dangerous fire, possession of a
prohibited weapon or device or unlawful possession of a weapon subsequent to being
charged with an offense, which, if committed by an adult, would constitute
unlawful possession of a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon or device,
placement in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential
reengagement center program and a requirement for the parent or guardian of the
juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings and
participate in programs conducted as part of this placement.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In both cases, a parent or
guardian of the juvenile or an appointed court official, as appropriate, is
required to provide written assurance that the juvenile and the parent,
guardian, or appointed court official, as appropriate, will appear at the next
hearing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, under current
law, if a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent, the court, in accordance with
certain principles, may order incarceration of the juvenile or may order
certain other enumerated dispositions.  Under this bill, in addition to the
dispositions set forth under current law, the court may also order the
following disposition: in the case of a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent
for an act, which if committed by an adult, would constitute unlawful
possession of a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon or device, place
the juvenile in a residential reengagement center or a non-residential
reengagement center program and order the parent or guardian of the juvenile or
an appointed court official, as appropriate, to attend hearings conducted as
part of this placement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, under current law,
one of the enumerated dispositions that a judge may order is a requirement for
a parent or guardian of the juvenile to make restitution in certain cases. 
This bill clarifies that the parent or guardian is also required to participate
in the restitution process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, reengagement
center is defined as a facility that provides counseling, direct career
placement services, self-improvement programs, school assistance, resources for
enrolling in college preparation courses or vocational training,
extracurricular activities, and information to assist the juvenile with
re-enrolling in a high school or a General Educational Development (GED)
program and that gives the juvenile an opportunity to reconnect with the
community for the purpose of rehabilitation and prevention of future unlawful
activity. </p>
