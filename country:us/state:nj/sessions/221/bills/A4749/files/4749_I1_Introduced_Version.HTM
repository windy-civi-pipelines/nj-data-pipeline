<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  N.J.S.2C:35-14 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2C:35-14. Rehabilitation
Program for Persons with a Substance Use Disorder Subject to a Presumption of
Incarceration or a Mandatory Minimum Period of Parole Ineligibility; Criteria
for Imposing Special Probation; Ineligible Offenders; Commitment to Residential
Treatment Facilities or Participation in a Nonresidential Treatment Program;
Presumption of Revocation; Brief Incarceration in Lieu of Permanent Revocation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Any person who is
ineligible for probation due to a conviction for a crime which is subject to a
presumption of incarceration or a mandatory minimum period of parole
ineligibility may be sentenced to a term of special probation in accordance
with this section, and may not apply for treatment for substance use disorder
pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prohibit a person who is eligible for probation in accordance with
N.J.S.2C:45-1 due to a conviction for an offense which is not subject to a
presumption of incarceration or a mandatory minimum period of parole ineligibility
from applying for treatment for substance use disorder as a condition of
probation pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1; provided, however, that a person in need
of treatment as defined in subsection f. of section 2 of P.L.2012, c.23
(C.2C:35-14.2) shall be sentenced in accordance with that section. 
Notwithstanding the presumption of incarceration pursuant to the provisions of
subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:44-1, whenever a person with a substance use disorder
who is subject to sentencing under this section is convicted of or adjudicated
delinquent for an offense, other than one described in subsection b. of this
section, the court, upon notice to the prosecutor, may, on motion of the
person, or on the courts own motion, place the person on special probation,
which shall be for a term of five years, provided that the court finds on the
record that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the person has undergone
a professional diagnostic assessment to determine whether and to what extent
the person has a substance use disorder and would benefit from treatment; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the person has a
substance use disorder within the meaning of N.J.S.2C:35-2 and was with a
substance use disorder at the time of the commission of the present offense;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the present offense was
committed while the person was under the influence of a controlled dangerous
substance, controlled<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>substance analog or alcohol or was
committed to acquire property or monies in order to support the person's
substance use disorder; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   substance use  disorder
treatment and monitoring will serve to benefit the person by addressing the
persons substance use disorder and will thereby reduce the likelihood that the
person will thereafter commit another offense; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   the person did not
possess a firearm at the time of the present offense and did not possess a
firearm at the time of any pending criminal charge; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   the person has not been
previously convicted on two or more separate occasions of crimes of the first
or second degree, other than those listed in paragraph (7); or the person has
not been previously convicted on two or more separate occasions, where one of
the offenses is a crime of the third degree, other than crimes defined in
N.J.S.2C:35-10, and one of the offenses is a crime of the first or second
degree; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   the person has not been
previously convicted or adjudicated delinquent for, and does not have a pending
charge of murder, aggravated manslaughter, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated
assault, aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault, or a similar crime under
the laws of any other state or the United States; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   a suitable treatment
facility licensed and approved by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction
Services in the Department of Human Services is able and has agreed to provide
appropriate treatment services in accordance with the requirements of this
section; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   no danger to the
community will result from the person being placed on special probation
pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In determining whether to
sentence the person pursuant to this section, the court shall consider all
relevant circumstances, and shall take judicial notice of any evidence,
testimony or information adduced at the trial, plea hearing or other court
proceedings, and shall also consider the presentence report and the results of
the professional diagnostic assessment to determine whether and to what extent
the person has a substance use disorder and would benefit from treatment.  The
court shall give priority to a person who has moved to be sentenced to special
probation over a person who is being considered for a sentence to special
probation on the courts own motion or in accordance with the provisions of
section 2 of P.L.2012, c.23 (C.2C:35-14.2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As a condition of special
probation, the court shall order the person to enter a residential treatment
program at a facility licensed and approved by the Division of Mental Health
and Addiction Services in the Department of Human Services or a program of
nonresidential treatment by a licensed and approved treatment provider, which
program may include the use of medication-assisted treatment as defined in
paragraph (7) of subsection f. of this section, to comply with program rules
and the requirements of the course of treatment, to cooperate fully with the
treatment provider, and to comply with such other reasonable terms and
conditions as may be required by the court or by law, pursuant to
N.J.S.2C:45-1, and which shall include periodic urine testing for drug or
alcohol usage throughout the period of special probation.  In determining
whether to order the person to participate in a nonresidential rather than a
residential treatment program, the court shall follow the procedure set forth
in subsection j. of this section.  Subject to the requirements of subsection d.
of this section, the conditions of special probation may include different
methods and levels of community-based or residential supervision.</p>

adjudicated delinquent for an offense under subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-5 or a
similar offense under any other law of this State, any other state or the
United States, who is placed on special probation under this section shall be
committed to the custody of a residential substance use  disorder treatment
facility licensed and approved by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction
Services in the Department of Human Services.  Subject to the authority of the
court to temporarily suspend imposition of all or any portion of the term of
commitment to a residential treatment facility pursuant to subsection j. of
this section, the person shall be committed to the residential treatment
facility immediately, unless the facility cannot accommodate the person, in
which case the person shall be incarcerated to await commitment to the
residential treatment facility.  The term of such commitment shall be for a
minimum of six months, or until the court, upon recommendation of the treatment
provider, determines that the person has successfully completed the residential
treatment program, whichever is later, except that no person shall remain in
the custody of a residential treatment facility pursuant to this section for a
period in excess of five years.  Upon successful completion of the required
residential treatment program, the person shall complete the period of special
probation, as authorized by subsection a. of this section, with credit for time
served for any imprisonment served as a condition of probation and credit for
each day during which the person satisfactorily complied with the terms and
conditions of special probation while committed pursuant to this section to a
residential treatment facility.  Except as otherwise provided in <u>paragraph
(1) of</u> subsection l. of this section, the person shall not be eligible for
early discharge of special probation pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-2, or any other
provision of the law.  The court, in determining the number of credits for time
spent in residential treatment, shall consider the recommendations of the
treatment provider.  A person placed into a residential treatment facility
pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be subject to official detention
for the purposes of N.J.S.2C:29-5 (escape).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The probation
department or other appropriate agency designated by the court to monitor or
supervise the persons special probation shall report periodically to the court
as to the persons progress in treatment and compliance with court-imposed
terms and conditions.  The treatment provider shall promptly report to the
probation department or other appropriate agency all significant failures by
the person to comply with any court-imposed term or condition of special
probation or any requirements of the course of treatment, including but not
limited to a positive drug or alcohol test, which shall only constitute a
violation for a person using medication-assisted treatment as defined in
paragraph (7) of subsection f. of this section if the positive test is
unrelated to the persons medication-assisted treatment, or the unexcused
failure to attend any session or activity, and shall immediately report any act
that would constitute an escape.  The probation department or other appropriate
agency shall immediately notify the court and the prosecutor in the event that
the person refuses to submit to a periodic drug or alcohol test or for any
reason terminates the person's participation in the course of treatment, or
commits any act that would constitute an escape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f. (1) Upon a first violation
of any term or condition of the special probation authorized by this section or
of any requirements of the course of treatment, the court in its discretion may

subsequent violation of any term or condition of the special probation authorized
by this section or of any requirements of the course of treatment, the court
shall, subject only to the provisions of subsection g. of this section,
permanently revoke the persons special probation unless the court finds on the
record that there is a substantial likelihood that the person will successfully
complete the treatment program if permitted to continue on special probation,
and the court is clearly convinced, considering the nature and seriousness of
the violations, that no danger to the community will result from permitting the
person to continue on special probation pursuant to this section.  The courts
determination to permit the person to continue on special probation following a
second or subsequent violation pursuant to this paragraph may be appealed by
the prosecution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   In making its
determination whether to revoke special probation, and whether to overcome the
presumption of revocation established in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the
court shall consider the nature and seriousness of the present infraction and
any past infractions in relation to the persons overall progress in the course
of treatment, and shall also consider the recommendations of the treatment
provider.  The court shall give added weight to the treatment providers
recommendation that the persons special probation be permanently revoked, or
to the treatment providers opinion that the person is not amenable to
treatment or is not likely to complete the treatment program successfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   If the court permanently
revokes the persons special probation pursuant to this subsection, the court
shall impose any sentence that might have been imposed, or that would have been
required to be imposed, originally for the offense for which the person was
convicted or adjudicated delinquent.  The court shall conduct a de novo review
of any aggravating and mitigating factors present at the time of both original
sentencing and resentencing.  If the court determines or is required pursuant
to any other provision of this chapter or any other law to impose a term of
imprisonment, the person shall receive credit for any time served in custody
pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1 or while awaiting placement in a treatment facility
pursuant to this section, and for each day during which the person
satisfactorily complied with the terms and conditions of special probation
while committed pursuant to this section to a residential treatment facility. 
The court, in determining the number of credits for time spent in a residential
treatment facility, shall consider the recommendations of the treatment
provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Following a violation,
if the court permits the person to continue on special probation pursuant to
this section, the court shall order the person to comply with such additional
terms and conditions, including but not limited to more frequent drug or
alcohol testing, as are necessary to deter and promptly detect any further
violation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Notwithstanding any
other provision of this subsection, if the person at any time refuses to
undergo urine testing for drug or alcohol usage as provided in subsection a. of
this section, the court shall, subject only to the provisions of subsection g.
of this section, permanently revoke the persons special probation. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the person at any time
while committed to the custody of a residential treatment facility pursuant to
this section commits an act that would constitute an escape, the court shall
forthwith permanently revoke the persons special probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   An action for a
violation under this section may be brought by a probation officer or
prosecutor or on the courts own motion.  Failure to complete successfully the
required treatment program shall constitute a violation of the persons special
probation.  In the case of the temporary or continued management of a persons
substance use disorder by means of medication-assisted treatment as defined
herein, whenever supported by a report from the treatment provider of existing
satisfactory progress and reasonably predictable long-term success with or
without further medication-assisted treatment, the persons use of the
medication-assisted treatment, even if continuing, shall not be the basis to
constitute a failure to complete successfully the treatment program.  A person
who fails to comply with the terms of the persons special probation pursuant
to this section and is thereafter sentenced to imprisonment in accordance with
this subsection shall thereafter be ineligible for entry into the Intensive Supervision
Program, provided however that this provision shall not affect the persons
eligibility for entry into the Intensive Supervision Program for a subsequent
conviction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this section, the
term medication-assisted treatment means the use of any medications approved
by the federal Food and Drug Administration to treat substance use disorders,
including extended-release naltrexone, methadone, and buprenorphine, in
combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide a whole-patient
approach to the treatment of substance use disorders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    When a person on special
probation is subject to a presumption of revocation on a second or subsequent
violation pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection f. of this section, or when
the person refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing pursuant to paragraph (6)
of subsection f. of this section, the court may, in lieu of permanently
revoking the persons special probation, impose a term of incarceration for a
period of not less than 30 days nor more than six months, after which the
persons term of special probation pursuant to this section may be reinstated. 
In determining whether to order a period of incarceration in lieu of permanent
revocation pursuant to this subsection, the court shall consider the
recommendations of the treatment provider with respect to the likelihood that
such confinement would serve to motivate the person to make satisfactory
progress in treatment once special probation is reinstated.  This disposition
may occur only once with respect to any person unless the court is clearly
convinced that there are compelling and extraordinary reasons to justify
reimposing this disposition with respect to the person.  Any such determination
by the court to reimpose this disposition may be appealed by the prosecution. 
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the
court at any time during the period of special probation to order a person on
special probation who is not subject to a presumption of revocation pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subsection f. of this section to be incarcerated over the
course of a weekend, or for any other reasonable period of time, when the court
in its discretion determines that such incarceration would help to motivate the
person to make satisfactory progress in treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The court, as a
condition of its order, and after considering the persons financial resources,
shall require the person to pay that portion of the costs associated with the
persons participation in any residential or nonresidential treatment program
imposed pursuant to this section which, in the opinion of the court, is
consistent with the persons ability to pay, taking into account the courts
authority to order payment or reimbursement to be made over time and in
installments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The court shall impose,
as a condition of the special probation, any fine, penalty, fee or restitution
applicable to the offense for which the person was convicted or adjudicated
delinquent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     Where the court finds
that a person has satisfied all of the eligibility criteria for special
probation and would otherwise be required to be committed to the custody of a
residential substance use disorders treatment facility pursuant to the
provisions of subsection d. of this section, the court may temporarily suspend
imposition of all or any portion of the term of commitment to a residential
treatment facility and may instead order the person to enter a nonresidential
treatment program, provided that the court finds on the record that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the person conducting
the diagnostic assessment required pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a.
of this section has recommended in writing that the proposed course of
nonresidential treatment services is clinically appropriate and adequate to
address the persons treatment needs; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   no danger to the
community would result from the person participating in the proposed course of
nonresidential treatment services; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   a suitable treatment
provider is able and has agreed to provide clinically appropriate
nonresidential treatment services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the prosecutor objects to
the courts decision to suspend the commitment of the person to a residential
treatment facility pursuant to this subsection, the sentence of special
probation imposed pursuant to this section shall not become final for 10 days
in order to permit the appeal by the prosecution of the courts decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After a period of six months
of nonresidential treatment, if the court, considering all available
information including but not limited to the recommendation of the treatment
provider, finds that the person has made satisfactory progress in treatment and
that there is a substantial likelihood that the person will successfully
complete the nonresidential treatment program and period of special probation,
the court, on notice to the prosecutor, may permanently suspend the commitment
of the person to the custody of a residential treatment program, in which event
the special monitoring provisions set forth in subsection k. of this section
shall no longer apply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to limit the authority of the court at any time during the
term of special probation to order the person to be committed to a residential
or nonresidential treatment facility if the court determines that such
treatment is clinically appropriate and necessary to address the persons
present treatment needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k. (1) When the court
temporarily suspends the commitment of the person to a residential treatment
facility pursuant to subsection j. of this section, the court shall, in
addition to ordering participation in a prescribed course of nonresidential
treatment and any other appropriate terms or conditions authorized or required
by law, order the person to undergo urine testing for drug or alcohol use not
less than once per week unless otherwise ordered by the court.  The
court-ordered testing shall be conducted by the probation department or the
treatment provider.  The results of all tests shall be reported promptly to the
court and to the prosecutor.  If the person is involved with a program that is
providing the person medication-assisted treatment as defined in paragraph (7)
of subsection f. of this section, only a positive urine test for drug or
alcohol use unrelated to the medication-assisted treatment shall constitute a
violation of the terms and conditions of special probation.  In addition, the
court shall impose appropriate curfews or other restrictions on the persons
movements, and may order the person to wear electronic monitoring devices to
enforce such curfews or other restrictions as a condition of special probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The probation department
or other appropriate agency shall immediately notify the court and the
prosecutor in the event that the person fails or refuses to submit to a drug or
alcohol test, knowingly defrauds the administration of a drug or alcohol test,
terminates the persons participation in the course of treatment, or commits
any act that would constitute absconding from parole.  If the person at any
time while entered in a nonresidential treatment program pursuant to subsection
j. of this section knowingly defrauds the administration of a drug or alcohol
test, goes into hiding, or leaves the State with a purpose of avoiding
supervision, the court shall permanently revoke the persons special probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     <u>(1)</u> If the court
finds that the person has made exemplary progress in the course of treatment,
the court may, upon recommendation of the persons supervising probation
officer or on the courts own motion, and upon notice to the prosecutor, grant
early discharge from a term of special probation provided that the person: (1)
has satisfactorily completed the treatment program ordered by the court; (2)
has served at least two years of special probation; (3) within the preceding 12
months, did not commit a substantial violation of any term or condition of
special probation, including but not limited to a positive urine test, which
shall only constitute a violation for a person using medication-assisted
treatment as defined in paragraph (7) of subsection f. of this section if the
positive test is unrelated to the persons medication-assisted treatment; and
(4) is not likely to relapse or commit an offense if probation supervision and
related services are discontinued.</p>

five-year term of special probation set forth in subsection a. of this section,
the person may, upon motion and with notice to the prosecutor, seek to extend

of any pending charges for an offense allegedly committed during the persons
term of special probation or to maintain eligibility for an expungement

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     First, the bill amends the
special probation statute (also known as Recovery Court) to allow a person who
successfully completes the Recovery Court program to have their entire record
expunged, including convictions for indictable crimes, disorderly persons
offenses, municipal ordinance violations, and juvenile offenses.  The bill also
removes the requirement that a person not be convicted of any new crimes while
in Recovery Court in order to be eligible for an expungement, but any new
convictions will not be expunged.  Under current law, Recovery Court
expungements only cover indictable crimes, and a person is eligible for a
Recovery Court expungement only if they have not been convicted of any new
crimes during their participation in the program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Second, the bill allows an
expungement petitioner to include all municipal ordinance violations and
juvenile delinquency adjudications that may also be eligible to be expunged on
a single petition, along with their other expungeable convictions.  Under
current law, a person must file up to three separate petitions for expungement
to cover indictable crimes and disorderly persons offenses, ordinance
violations, and juvenile records.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Third, the bill amends the
list of crimes for which convictions may not be expunged.  Under the bill,
robbery in the second degree becomes expungeable, but robbery in the first
degree remains non-expungeable.  Also under the bill, endangering the welfare
of a child, where the offense did not involve sexual conduct, becomes
expungeable, but convictions involving sexual conduct or child pornography
remain non-expungeable.  Additionally under the bill, a conviction for
possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute within 500 feet
of a public housing facility, public park, or public building, which would
otherwise be a non-expungeable second degree crime, becomes expungeable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Fourth, the bill eliminates a
barrier to expungement posed by out-of-state or federal convictions.  Under
current law, when calculating a persons eligibility for an expungement,
out-of-state and federal convictions are counted against the total number of
convictions a person may have on their record.  However, at present, there is
no expungement available for federal convictions, and expungement laws vary
from state to state.  Therefore, the bill amends the statutes so that
eligibility is determined only under the laws of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Fifth, the bill amends the
electronic filing and review process by which a person seeks an expungement
through the courts.  Under current law, the e-filing system automatically sends
a copy of the petition to the State Police, the Attorney General, and county
prosecutors so that they can review the petition for accuracy and completeness
and, if appropriate, file objections to the expungement.  However, although
these agencies are required to notify the court of any inaccurate or missing information,
they are presently not required to provide copies of the correct or missing
documentation to the petitioner.  The bill requires these agencies to make
copies of these documents available to the petitioner and the court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Sixth, the bill harmonizes the
provisions concerning court-ordered financial assessments across all types of
expungements.  Under current law, a person becomes eligible for an expungement
after a statutory waiting period, which begins to run from the date of release
from incarceration, probation, or parole, or the date that a court-ordered
financial assessment is satisfied, whichever is later.  In 2023, the statutes
concerning expungements for indictable crimes, disorderly persons offenses, and
Clean Slate expungements were amended to allow a person to become eligible
for an expungement so long as the statutory waiting period is met, even if the
court-ordered financial assessment is satisfied late.  Alternatively, the 2023
statute revisions also allow a person to become eligible for an expungement by
demonstrating compelling circumstances for non-payment.  Under the bill, these
court-ordered financial assessment provisions are extended to expungements for municipal
ordinance violations and juvenile delinquency adjudications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Seventh, the bill expands the
eligibility of persons with juvenile delinquency records to receive an
expungement.  Under current law, a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent for
an offense which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime that
cannot be expunged would also not be eligible for an expungement.  However, the
New Jersey Supreme Court has recognized, in cases such as <u>State v. Zuber</u>,
227 <u>N.J.</u> 422 (2017), and <u>State v. Comer</u>, 249 <u>N.J.</u> 359
(2022), that juvenile offenders should not be subject to the same lifetime bars
to post-conviction relief as adult offenders.  Therefore, the bill eliminates
this barrier to expungement for juveniles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Eighth, the bill expands the
availability of Clean Slate expungements.  The Clean Slate expungement law
passed in 2019 called for the eventual adoption of a system to automatically
expunge convictions after ten years.  Under the bill, the Clean Slate law is
extended to include automatic expungement of juvenile adjudications. 
Additionally, under the bill, the waiting period for a Clean Slate
expungement is reduced from ten to seven years.  The 2019 Clean Slate law
also established a task force to make recommendations concerning how an
automatic expungement system could be implemented.  Because the automatic
system is not yet operational, and in light of revisions to the expungement
laws since 2019, the bill calls for the re-establishment of the task force,
with an expanded membership, to provide the Governor and the Legislature with
updated recommendations.</p>
