<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes changes to the
current law requiring school districts, charter schools, nonpublic schools, and
contracted service providers to review the employment history of certain applicants
and any allegations of child abuse or sexual misconduct made against those
applicants.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law requires the
Department of Education to develop forms for applicants and employers that may
be used to comply with requirements concerning the review of an applicants
employment history.  This bill requires the departments Office of Student
Protection to develop the forms and requires that the forms be used in
complying with the employment history requirements.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law also requires
applicants to positions involving regular contact with students at school
districts, charter schools, nonpublic schools, and contracted service providers
to provide a list of certain former employers of the applicant within the last
20 years.  The bill removes the 20-year limit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, an
applicant who gives false information or willfully fails to disclose
information required to be provided under the law may be subject to certain
civil penalties up to $500. The bill increases the maximum civil penalty amount
to $10,000.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill further requires the
Commissioner of Education to create and maintain a secure and centralized
school employee identification database.  The purpose of the database is to
provide school districts, charter schools, nonpublic schools, and contracted
service providers with ready access to any information that may disqualify an
individual from being hired by, or continuing employment with, a school
district, charter school, nonpublic school, or contr<img width=577 height=1258
id="Picture 1" src="3054_I1_files/image001.gif">acted service provider.  The bill
requires specific categories of information to be included in the database. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
commissioner to establish policies and procedures to provide secure access to
the database.  The commissioner is directed to establish policies and procedures
to ensure the accuracy of the information in the database.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also directs each
school district, charter school, nonpublic school, or contracted service
provider to request that the Department of Children and Families conduct a
child abuse record information check of its child abuse records to determine if
an incident of child abuse or neglect has been substantiated against any
applicant to a position involving regular contact with students at the school
district, charter school, nonpublic school, or contracted service provider and
includes provisions pertaining to how those records are to be secured and used. 
The bill requires the State Board of Examiners to submit to the commissioner
notice of any pending review that may result in the revocation or suspension of
an administrative or instructional certificate.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also requires the commissioner
to audit the hiring records of a school district, charter school, nonpublic
school, or contracted service provider holding a contract with a school
district, charter school, or nonpublic school to ensure compliance with the provisions
of law.  The audit is to occur every five years, pursuant to a schedule
established by the commissioner.  The bill authorizes the commissioner to
conduct random audits.  Additionally, the bill permits the commissioner to
contract with a qualified third party to conduct the audits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, if the commissioner
determines the hiring practices do not comply with the law, but the
noncompliance does not pose an immediate threat to the safety or wellbeing of
students or staff of the school, then the commissioner is to issue
recommendations for compliance with the law to the school district, charter
school, nonpublic school, or contracted service provider holding a contract
with a school district, charter school, or nonpublic school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner is also authorized
under the bill to provide direct oversight of the hiring practices of a school
district, charter school, or nonpublic school if the commissioner determines
through an audit that the hiring practices fail to comply with the provisions of
the law, and the noncompliance is determined by the commissioner to: (1) be the
result of willful misconduct or gross negligence; (2) pose an immediate threat
to the safety or wellbeing of students or staff of the school; or (3) constitute
a failure to implement the recommendations issued by the commissioner as a
result of a previous audit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the department
to establish procedures for the prompt investigation of allegations of child
abuse or sexual misconduct by a school employee.  The procedures are to require
certain components as specified in the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires school
districts, charter schools, and nonpublic schools to utilize the procedures
established by the bill for any investigation regarding an allegation by a
school employee.  The bill further prohibits school districts, charter schools,
and nonpublic schools from entering into contracts with contracted services
providers unless the provider attests that it utilizes comparable investigation
procedures as established by the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The department is also
required to establish guidelines to assist school districts, charter schools,
and nonpublic schools in implementing the investigation procedures and for
determining when to refer an allegation of child abuse or sexual misconduct to
law enforcement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill permits a board of
education, board of trustees of a charter school, or chief school administrator
of a nonpublic school to enter into a memorandum of agreement with law
enforcement regarding allegations of child abuse or sexual misconduct by school
employees and the procedures and responsibilities of designated employees in
conducting investigations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires the
commissioner to issue a report to the Governor and the Legislature every five
years on implementation the law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill implements certain
recommendations of the New Jersey State Commission of Investigations March
2024 report, Safeguarding New Jersey Students from Sexual Predators and Child
Abuse at School  Examining the States Pass the Trash Law. </p>
