CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Joint Resolution designating November of every year as Arts and Health Month in New Jersey Whereas, The arts encompasses many forms of creative expression such as literary, performing, and visual arts, which are used to evoke emotion, convey meaning, and provoke thought; and Whereas, The State of New Jersey recognizes the vital importance of promoting the health and wellbeing of its citizens, as well as fostering a deep appreciation for the arts and humanities; and Whereas, Roughly 28 percent of people living in New Jersey suffer from anxiety, depression, or a combination of the two; and Whereas, Research has demonstrated that engaging in arts and humanities related activities can reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress by 73 percent; and Whereas, Individuals with regular exposure to the arts have a higher likelihood of reporting better overall health compared to those with limited or no engagement; and Whereas, The intersection of arts, humanities, and health has been shown to have positive effects on mental, emotional, and physical well-being; and Whereas, Black and Hispanic students lack access to quality arts education earning between 30 and 25 percent fewer arts credits compared to white students; and Whereas, A Statewide Arts and Health Month would help bridge the divide between high and low income areas by providing free and low-cost arts and health programs to individuals across New Jersey; and Whereas, Low income communities would be empowered to explore the connections between artistic expression and health outcomes; and Whereas, By designating November of every year as Arts and Health Month, individuals will engage in creative activities that lead to improved health, stress reduction, enhanced social connections, and increased self-expression; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. November of every year is designated Arts and Health Month in New Jersey in order to bring health, humanities, and arts programming to underserved populations, as well as to enhance the appreciation and understanding of the arts as integral to the health of individuals and communities. 2. The Governor shall annually issue a proclamation and call upon public officials, and all citizens of this State, to observe Arts and Health Month with appropriate programs and activities. 3. This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates November of every year as Arts and Health Month in New Jersey with the goal of bringing health, humanities, and arts programming to underserved communities. Statistics show that roughly 28 percent of individuals living in New Jersey suffer from anxiety and depression related issues. The impact that exposure to the arts can have on an individuals mental well-being is extensive with 73 percent of individuals who engage in art related activities reporting a reduction in anxiety and depression. Despite this strong correlation, art disparities persist in our communities with Black and Hispanic students receiving less exposure to the arts compared to White students. The arts are defined as forms of creative expression that are used to evoke emotion and provoke thought. By bringing art programming to underserved communities, New Jerseys Arts and Health Month will help enhance the publics appreciation and understanding of the arts and the role they play in improving an individuals mental health. Recognizing November as Arts and Health Month will also help bring the arts to underserved communities ensuring that everyone has access to this vital mental health resource.
