STATEMENT This bill would legalize the possession of six or fewer marijuana plants, subject to the enactment of legislation that legalizes the personal use of marijuana or cannabis. Assembly, No. 21(2R), the Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act, would legalize personal use. A-21(2R) was substituted for identical bill Senate, No. 21(2R) on December 17, 2020, and passed both Houses.  The bill is currently on the Governors desk. However, A-21(2R) would not allow the home grow of marijuana for personal use.  This bill would allow home grow in an amount of up to six marijuana plants.

(2)  If an object appears to be for use, intended for use, or designed for use with cannabis or cannabis items in accordance with the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act,  P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as Assembly, No. 21(2R) of 2020-2021), the object is presumed to be a lawful cannabis paraphernalia as defined in section 3 of Assembly, No. 21(2R) of 2020-2021 (C.      ), and does not alone constitute reasonable articulable suspicion that the object is a drug paraphernalia, notwithstanding that the object could also be used with an illegal controlled substance or controlled substance analog, unless the owner or any other person in proximity to or in control of the object was in possession of an illegal controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog, or the object was in proximity of an illegally possessed controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog to indicate its use, intended use, or design for use with that controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog. (cf: P.L.2007, c.31, s.2) 3.  N.J.S.2C:36-2 is amended to read as follows: 2C:36-2.     a.   Use or possession with intent to use, disorderly persons offense. It shall be unlawful for any person to use, or to possess with intent to use, drug paraphernalia to plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain, conceal, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled dangerous substance, controlled substance analog or toxic chemical in violation of the provisions of chapter 35 of this title, other than when used, or possessed with intent to use, for ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing marijuana or hashish into the human body. Any person who violates this section is guilty of a disorderly persons offense. b.    Notwithstanding that using or possessing with intent to use drug paraphernalia to ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce marijuana or hashish into the human body is not a punishable crime, offense, act of delinquency, or civil violation pursuant to this section, the use of drug paraphernalia for that purpose may be prohibited or otherwise regulated on or in any property by the person or entity that owns or controls that property, including multifamily housing that is a multiple dwelling as defined in section 3 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-3), the structure or specific units of the structure of a cooperative as defined in section 3 of P.L.1987, c.381 (C.46:8D-3), the units of a condominium, as those terms are defined by section 3 of P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-3), or a site in a mobile home park as defined in section 3 of P.L.1983, c.386 (C.40:55D-102), which site is leased to the owner of a manufactured home, as defined in that section, that is installed thereon. (cf: P.L.2007, c.31, s.3) 4.  This act shall take effect upon the enactment of Assembly, No. 21(2R) of 2020-2021. STATEMENT This bill would legalize the possession of six or fewer marijuana plants, subject to the enactment of legislation that legalizes the personal use of marijuana or cannabis. Assembly, No. 21(2R), the Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act, would legalize personal use. A-21(2R) was substituted for identical bill Senate, No. 21(2R) on December 17, 2020, and passed both Houses.  The bill is currently on the Governors desk. However, A-21(2R) would not allow the home grow of marijuana for personal use.  This bill would allow home grow in an amount of up to six marijuana plants.
