<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the <span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>Support for Victims of Domestic Violence Program</span>
(program), to be administered by the Division on Women (division) in the
Department of Children and Families.  The purpose of the program is to
incentivize businesses in New Jersey to offer support in goods and services to
individuals who have been recent victims of domestic violence, sexual assault,
or stalking, or attempted domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking
(eligible individuals).  The program allows the division to award tax credits,
to be applied against the Corporation Business Tax or the New Jersey Gross
Income Tax, to an eligible business in exchange for the eligible businesss
commitment to provide certain goods or services to eligible individuals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
division, in consultation with Advisory Council on Domestic Violence (advisory
council), to establish at least three support regions in New Jersey and adopt a
domestic violence safety net plan for each region.  The regional plans are
required to give consideration to the existing governmental and nonprofit
resources available to eligible individuals in a region and set priorities for
which goods and services are still needed in that region, and consider how the
public and private safety nets in each region can best be enhanced by the availability
and provision of goods and services by eligible businesses.  Under the bill,
the division is required to consider, in developing each regional plan, the
provision of: household essentials and clothing; technology security devices
and services; communications devices and services; and housing and emergency
accommodations.  Under the bill, the division is required to accept program
applications and awarding tax credits to eligible businesses that commit to
providing goods or services to eligible individuals, consistent with an
applicable regional plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The value of all credits
awarded by the division pursuant to the program in any State fiscal year is not
to exceed $25,000,000.  In addition to the annual $25,000,000 cap, the bill
prohibits the division from approving the award of more than: $15,000,000 in
tax credits related to housing and emergency accommodations; $10,000,000 in tax
credits related to household essentials and clothing, technology security
devices and services, and communications devices and services, combined; and
$3,000,000 in tax credits related to other goods or services.  The bill
requires the division to develop tax credit allocation formulas to establish
separate tax credit award goals for each category of support in each region of
the State.  The bill also establishes program application requirements and
application review requirements.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that program
agreements include certain provisions, as specified in the bill.  The bill also
requires the division, in consultation with the Director of the Division of
Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, to develop standards for the award
of tax credits to eligible businesses consistent with each program agreement,
and develop procedures for the content and issuance of tax credit certificates
to be awarded under the program. The director of the division, in consultation
with the advisory council and the Director of the Division of Taxation in the
Department of the Treasury, is required to adopt rules and regulations to
effectuate the purposes of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the division
to regularly collect and analyze information related to the efficacy of the
program in supplementing the government and nonprofit safety net of support for
individuals who are recent victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and
stalking. The bill further requires the division to submit annual program
reports to the Governor and to the Legislature.  Each annual report is required
to include recommendations to the Legislature for any changes to the program
that would allow the division or eligible businesses to better support
individuals who are recent victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and
stalking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the amount of
the credits allowed against the taxes imposed are prohibited from exceeding 50
percent of the taxpayer's liability for tax, and may be carried over, if
necessary, to the seven privilege periods or taxable years. </p>
