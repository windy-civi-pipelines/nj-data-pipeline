Failure to include such information with the mail-in ballot shall result in its rejection. f.     The county clerk shall not transmit a mail-in ballot for any election to any person who: is deemed by a county commissioner of registration to be an inactive voter; or notifies the clerk in writing that the person no longer wishes to receive such a ballot for any election; or is no longer eligible to vote and whose registration file has been transferred to the deleted file pursuant to R.S.19:31-19. g.    Any mail-in ballot that is sent to a qualified voter and that is returned to the county clerk for any reason shall be forwarded to the commissioner of registration, who shall so note the return in the voter record of that voter.

No person may serve as an authorized messenger or bearer for more than three qualified voters in an election, but a person may serve as such for up to five qualified voters in an election if those voters are immediate family members residing in the same household as the messenger or bearer. No person who is a candidate in the election for which the voter requests a mail-in ballot may provide any assistance in the completion of the ballot or serve as an authorized messenger or bearer. A person who applies for a mail-in ballot must submit his or her application at least seven days before the election, but such person may request an application in person from the county clerk up to 3 p.m. of the day before the election. Voters who want to vote by mail in all [future] elections held in the same calendar year will, after their initial request and without further action on their part in that calendar year, be provided with a mail-in ballot [until] unless the voter requests otherwise in writing [, or beginning with the 2020 general election cycle, if the voter does not vote by mail in four consecutive years, then the voter shall no longer be furnished with a mail-in ballot for future elections and the voter shall be notified in writing of the change]. Application forms may be obtained by applying to the undersigned either in writing or by telephone, or the application form provided below may be completed and forwarded to the undersigned.

(2)   The Secretary of State shall undertake a program to inform voters in this State about their eligibility to vote by mail pursuant to this act.  Dissemination of this information shall be included in the standard notices required by this section and other provisions of current law, including but not limited to the notice requirements of R.S.19:12-7, and shall be effectuated by such means as the secretary deems appropriate and to the extent that funds for such dissemination are appropriated including, but not limited to, by means of Statewide or local electronic media, public service announcements broadcast by such media, notices on the Internet site of the Department of State or any other department or agency of the Executive Branch of State government or its political subdivisions deemed appropriate by the secretary, and special mailings or notices in newspapers or other publications circulating in the counties or municipalities of this State. c.     The mail-in ballot materials shall contain a notice that any person voting by mail-in ballot who has registered by mail after January 1, 2003, who did not provide personal identification information when registering and is voting for the first time in his or her current county of residence following registration shall include copies of the required identification information with the mail-in ballot, and that failure to include such information shall result in the rejection of the ballot. d.    The notice provided for in subsection a. of this section shall be published before the 55th day immediately preceding the holding of any election. Notices relating to any Statewide or countywide election shall be published in at least two newspapers published in each county.  All officials charged with the duty of publishing such notices shall publish the same in at least one newspaper published in each municipality or district in which the election is to be held, or if no newspaper is published in the municipality or district, then in a newspaper published in the county and circulating in the municipality or district.  All such notices shall be display advertisements. (cf:  P.L.2022, c.68, s.4) 5.    Within 30 days of the implementation date of this act, the county clerk in each county shall transmit to each voter who is designated in the Statewide Voter Registration System as receiving a mail-in ballot for all future elections, a notice informing the voter that he or she is required to complete an application to vote by mail each calendar year, pursuant to the provisions of this act, P.L.   , c.   (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 6.    Section 14 of P.L.2018, c.72 (C.19:63-3.1) is repealed. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately, and shall be implemented on the first day following the November general election occurring after that effective date. STATEMENT This bill requires a voter who wishes to vote by mail to complete an application for a mail-in ballot each calendar year. The bill also repeals a provision of current law which required each county clerk to designate each voter who voted by mail in 2016, 2017, and 2018 as automatic vote-by-mail voters in all future elections. Under current law, a voter may apply to vote by mail in all future elections or in any single election. A voter who indicates a desire to vote by mail in all future elections is not required to reapply for a mail-in ballot each year, but may notify the county clerk that he or she no longer wishes to vote by mail. However, beginning with the 2020 general election cycle, if the voter does not vote by mail in four consecutive years, then the voter is no longer furnished with a mail-in ballot for future elections and the voter is notified in writing of the change. This bill would require voters who want to vote by mail to complete a mail-in ballot application each calendar year. The application would offer the voter the opportunity to either vote by mail in all elections held in that calendar year, or in any single election held in that calendar year. This bill also repeals a provision of law that made voters who voted by mail in 2016, 2017, and 2018 be designated as automatic vote-by-mail voters in all future elections, unless they opted out at the time of the laws implementation. The bill requires the county clerk in each county, within 30 days of the implementation date, to transmit to each voter who is designated in the Statewide Voter Registration System as receiving a mail-in ballot for all future elections, a notice informing the voter that he or she is required to complete an application to vote by mail each calendar year. The bill would take effect immediately, but would be implemented on the first day following the November general election occurring after that effective date.

The required information shall be collected and stored for the time and in the manner required pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary of State. j.     The Secretary of State shall amend the voter registration application form if necessary to conform to the requirements of applicable federal or State law. k.    In the event that the name of any political party entered on the voter registration form by a voter who wishes to declare a political party affiliation is not legible, the commissioner of registration shall mail the voter a political party declaration form and a letter explaining that the voter's choice was not understood and that the voter should complete and return the declaration form in order to be affiliated with a party. (cf: P.L.2019, c.270, s.3) 2.    Section 3 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-3) is amended to read as follows: 3.  a.  A qualified voter shall be entitled to vote using a mail-in ballot by completing a mail-in ballot application each calendar year, indicating the voters desire to vote: (1)  in all [future] elections, including general elections, held in this State in the calendar year, in which the voter is eligible to vote; or (2)  in any single election held in this State in the calendar year, in which the voter is eligible to vote. The qualified voter who chooses the option to vote using a mail-in ballot in all [future] elections held in this State in the calendar year shall be furnished with such a ballot by the county clerk without further request on the part of the voter [and until] for that calendar year, unless the voter requests in writing that the voter no longer be sent a mail-in ballot [, or beginning with the 2020 general election cycle, if the voter does not vote by mail in four consecutive years, then the voter shall no longer be furnished with a mail-in ballot for future elections and the voter shall be notified in writing of the change]. The mail-in ballot application form prepared by the Secretary of State shall present the two options in the order provided above.  The mail-in ballot application shall also provide spaces for the voter's telephone number and email address, including language informing the voter that this contact information will be used to contact the voter concerning the acceptance or rejection of the ballot, and how the voter may cure a defect.  A voter's telephone number and email address shall not be subject to public disclosure and shall not be considered a government record. The additional direct expenditures required for the implementation of the provisions of this subsection as amended by section 1 of P.L.2018, c.72 shall be offset pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2019, c.459 (C.19:63-29). b.  (1)  Not less than seven days before an election in which a voter wants to vote by mail, the voter may apply to the person designated in section 5 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-5), for a mail-in ballot.  The application shall be in writing, shall be signed by the applicant and shall state the applicant's place of voting residence and the address to which the ballot shall be sent.  In the case of a voter choosing to have their mail-in ballot sent to a secondary address, if the ballot is returned or marked undeliverable for two consecutive general elections, then future mail-in ballots shall be mailed to the voter's address where they are registered to vote and the voter shall be notified in writing of the change. The Secretary of State shall prepare a mail-in application form and shall have the authority to promulgate any rules and regulations the secretary deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subsection. (2)  Beginning on January 1, 2026 and thereafter, not less than seven days before an election in which a voter wants to vote by mail, instead of submitting an application under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the voter may apply for a mail-in ballot electronically through the voter registration website established by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2019, c.382 (C.19:31-6.4c), which application shall be electronically submitted to the person designated by the Secretary of State.  The application shall be in electronic form, shall be signed by the applicant using the applicant's electronic signature in the Statewide Voter Registration System, and shall state the applicant's place of voting residence and the address to which the ballot shall be sent.  The Secretary of State shall prepare a mail-in ballot electronic application form and shall have the authority to promulgate any guidance, guidelines, rules and regulations the secretary deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this subsection.  The rules and regulations shall ensure the security of the online mail-in ballot application form and the use of verifiable signatures, including a process for the resolution of signature discrepancies and the validation of the information provided by the applicant. c.     Any voter wanting to vote by mail in any election may apply to the person designated in section 5 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-5) for a mail-in ballot to be sent to the voter.  A voter who is a member of the armed forces of the United States may use a federal postcard application form to apply for a mail-in ballot. d.    Any voter who fails to apply for a mail-in ballot before the seven-day period prescribed in subsection b. of this section may apply in person to the county clerk for a mail-in ballot up to 3 p.m. of the day before the election. e.     A person voting by mail-in ballot who registered by mail after January 1, 2003, who did not provide personal identification information when registering pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1974, c.30 (C.19:31-6.4) and is voting for the first time in his or her current county of residence following registration shall include copies of the required identification information with the mail-in ballot. Failure to include such information with the mail-in ballot shall result in its rejection. f.     The county clerk shall not transmit a mail-in ballot for any election to any person who: is deemed by a county commissioner of registration to be an inactive voter; or notifies the clerk in writing that the person no longer wishes to receive such a ballot for any election; or is no longer eligible to vote and whose registration file has been transferred to the deleted file pursuant to R.S.19:31-19. g.    Any mail-in ballot that is sent to a qualified voter and that is returned to the county clerk for any reason shall be forwarded to the commissioner of registration, who shall so note the return in the voter record of that voter. (cf: P.L.2022, c.68, s.1) 3.    Section 5 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-5) is amended to read as follows: 5.    In the case of any election, the application for a mail-in ballot shall be made to the county clerk.  The county clerk shall stamp thereon the date on which the application was received in the clerk's office. In the case of applications for overseas federal election voter ballots, as provided for in P.L.1976, c.23 (C.19:59-1 et seq.), no application shall be refused on the grounds that it was submitted too early. In the case of voter registration forms that include a selected vote by mail option, a copy of each such form shall be transmitted to and received by the appropriate county clerk, who shall be responsible for providing mail-in ballots to each qualified voter requesting such ballots for [future] all elections [, until] held in that calendar year, unless the voter requests otherwise in writing [, or beginning with the 2020 general election cycle, if the voter does not vote by mail in four consecutive years, then the voter shall no longer be furnished with a mail-in ballot for future all elections and the voter shall be notified in writing of the change]. (cf: P.L.2022, c.68, s.3) 4.    Section 6 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-6) is amended to read as follows: 6. a. The county clerk, in the case of any Statewide election, countywide election, or school election in a regional or other school district comprising more than one municipality; the municipal clerk, in the case of any municipal election or school election in a school district comprising a single municipality; and the commissioners or other governing or administrative body of the district, in the case of any election to be held in any fire district or other special district, other than a municipality, created for specified public purposes within one or more municipalities, shall publish the following notice in substantially the following form: NOTICE TO PERSONS WANTING MAIL-IN BALLOTS If you are a qualified and registered voter of the State who wants to vote by mail in the......................... (school, municipal, primary, general, or other) election to be held on................. (date of election), the following applies: You must complete the application form below and send it to the county clerk where you reside or write or apply in person to the county clerk where you reside to request a mail-in ballot.  Instead, you may complete the application form electronically on the Secretary of State's website.

No person who is a candidate in the election for which the voter requests a mail-in ballot may provide any assistance in the completion of the ballot or serve as an authorized messenger or bearer. A person who applies for a mail-in ballot must submit his or her application at least seven days before the election, but such person may request an application in person from the county clerk up to 3 p.m. of the day before the election. Voters who want to vote by mail in all [future] elections held in the same calendar year will, after their initial request and without further action on their part in that calendar year, be provided with a mail-in ballot [until] unless the voter requests otherwise in writing [, or beginning with the 2020 general election cycle, if the voter does not vote by mail in four consecutive years, then the voter shall no longer be furnished with a mail-in ballot for future elections and the voter shall be notified in writing of the change]. Application forms may be obtained by applying to the undersigned either in writing or by telephone, or the application form provided below may be completed and forwarded to the undersigned. Dated..................................................... ........................................................................ (signature and title of county clerk) .................................... (address of county clerk) .................................... (telephone no. of county clerk) b.  (1)  The Secretary of State shall be responsible for providing all information regarding overseas ballots to each overseas voter eligible for such a ballot pursuant to P.L.1976, c.23 (C.19:59-1 et seq.).  The secretary shall also make available valid overseas voter registration and ballot applications to any voter who is a member of the armed forces of the United States and who is a permanent resident of this State, or who is an overseas voter who wishes to register to vote or to vote in any jurisdiction in this State.  The secretary shall provide such public notice as may be deemed necessary to inform members of the armed forces of the United States and overseas voters how to obtain valid overseas voter registration and ballot applications. (2)   The Secretary of State shall undertake a program to inform voters in this State about their eligibility to vote by mail pursuant to this act.  Dissemination of this information shall be included in the standard notices required by this section and other provisions of current law, including but not limited to the notice requirements of R.S.19:12-7, and shall be effectuated by such means as the secretary deems appropriate and to the extent that funds for such dissemination are appropriated including, but not limited to, by means of Statewide or local electronic media, public service announcements broadcast by such media, notices on the Internet site of the Department of State or any other department or agency of the Executive Branch of State government or its political subdivisions deemed appropriate by the secretary, and special mailings or notices in newspapers or other publications circulating in the counties or municipalities of this State. c.     The mail-in ballot materials shall contain a notice that any person voting by mail-in ballot who has registered by mail after January 1, 2003, who did not provide personal identification information when registering and is voting for the first time in his or her current county of residence following registration shall include copies of the required identification information with the mail-in ballot, and that failure to include such information shall result in the rejection of the ballot. d.    The notice provided for in subsection a. of this section shall be published before the 55th day immediately preceding the holding of any election. Notices relating to any Statewide or countywide election shall be published in at least two newspapers published in each county.  All officials charged with the duty of publishing such notices shall publish the same in at least one newspaper published in each municipality or district in which the election is to be held, or if no newspaper is published in the municipality or district, then in a newspaper published in the county and circulating in the municipality or district.  All such notices shall be display advertisements. (cf:  P.L.2022, c.68, s.4) 5.    Within 30 days of the implementation date of this act, the county clerk in each county shall transmit to each voter who is designated in the Statewide Voter Registration System as receiving a mail-in ballot for all future elections, a notice informing the voter that he or she is required to complete an application to vote by mail each calendar year, pursuant to the provisions of this act, P.L.   , c.   (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 6.    Section 14 of P.L.2018, c.72 (C.19:63-3.1) is repealed. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately, and shall be implemented on the first day following the November general election occurring after that effective date. STATEMENT This bill requires a voter who wishes to vote by mail to complete an application for a mail-in ballot each calendar year. The bill also repeals a provision of current law which required each county clerk to designate each voter who voted by mail in 2016, 2017, and 2018 as automatic vote-by-mail voters in all future elections. Under current law, a voter may apply to vote by mail in all future elections or in any single election. A voter who indicates a desire to vote by mail in all future elections is not required to reapply for a mail-in ballot each year, but may notify the county clerk that he or she no longer wishes to vote by mail. However, beginning with the 2020 general election cycle, if the voter does not vote by mail in four consecutive years, then the voter is no longer furnished with a mail-in ballot for future elections and the voter is notified in writing of the change. This bill would require voters who want to vote by mail to complete a mail-in ballot application each calendar year. The application would offer the voter the opportunity to either vote by mail in all elections held in that calendar year, or in any single election held in that calendar year. This bill also repeals a provision of law that made voters who voted by mail in 2016, 2017, and 2018 be designated as automatic vote-by-mail voters in all future elections, unless they opted out at the time of the laws implementation. The bill requires the county clerk in each county, within 30 days of the implementation date, to transmit to each voter who is designated in the Statewide Voter Registration System as receiving a mail-in ballot for all future elections, a notice informing the voter that he or she is required to complete an application to vote by mail each calendar year. The bill would take effect immediately, but would be implemented on the first day following the November general election occurring after that effective date.
