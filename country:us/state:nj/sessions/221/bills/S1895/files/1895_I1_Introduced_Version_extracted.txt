This bill would expand the list of individuals who could receive no fee or a reduced beach fee to children between the ages of 12 and 17.  In addition, the bill would delete language in current law limiting the exemption and reduced fee to veterans who have either served at least 90 days in active duty or have been discharged or released from active duty by reason of a service-incurred injury or disability.
