<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill concerns the
licensing of security officer companies. Under the Security Officer
Registration Act, a person is not to engage in the business of a security
officer company, or advertise or hold out a business to be a security officer
company, unless the business is licensed by the Superintendent of State
Police.  Current law defines owner or operator as an officer, director,
member, sole proprietor, partner, or associate of a private security company. 
This bill expands the definition to also include nonprofit organizations in
addition to private security companies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines nonprofit
organization as an organization located in New Jersey which is exempt from
federal taxation pursuant to the federal Internal Revenue Code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, current law provides
that an application to be licensed as a security officer company is required to
be submitted to the superintendent by each owner and operator of the company. 
The application is required to contain information setting forth that the
owners or operators have five years law enforcement experience and are no
longer employed by or attached in any capacity whatsoever to a law enforcement
agency, or five years experience working in a supervisory or management
capacity for a licensed security officer company.  This bill clarifies that
either the owner or operator is required to have law enforcement experience or
experience working for a licensed security officer company as set forth under
current law.  The bill provides that the superintendent is not to require both
the owner and operator to have law enforcement experience or experience working
for a licensed security officer company as set forth under current law. </p>
