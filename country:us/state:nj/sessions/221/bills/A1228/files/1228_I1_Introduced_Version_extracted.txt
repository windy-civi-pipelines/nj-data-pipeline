The department would be required to post a text link or icon on its homepage, in capital and bold letters, that includes the phrase Suicide Prevention Hotline and the phone number to the New Jersey Suicide Prevention Hopeline.  Also, the department would be required to post an icon on its homepage, in an easily distinguishable color and font, that hyperlinks to an Internet webpage which would include a list of additional resources available to aid distressed farmers, including assistance for suicide prevention, mental health resources, disaster assistance, legal assistance, and financial assistance. Mental health illnesses and disorders, such as anxiety and depression, have increased significantly in farmers and other agricultural workers since the 1980s due to factors such as profit losses caused by the shrinking price of commodities, increased debt caused by high interest rates, tariffs, and trade barriers, and isolation.  The CDC found that farmers and ranchers were, on average, 3.5 times that of the general population to die from suicide.
