sections 1 through 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15 et seq.) shall be
liberally construed to effectuate the purpose of primarily relying upon
pretrial release by non-monetary means to reasonably assure an eligible
defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of
any other person or the community, that the eligible defendant will not
obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, and that the
eligible defendant will comply with all conditions of release, while
authorizing the court, upon motion of a prosecutor, to order pretrial detention
of the eligible defendant when<u>, except as otherwise provided in sections 1
through 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15 et seq.),</u> it finds clear and
convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions can
reasonably assure the effectuation of these goals. Monetary bail may be set for
an eligible defendant only when it is determined that no other conditions of
release will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court
when required. </p>

following the issuance of a complaint-warrant pursuant to the conditions set
forth under subsection c. of this section, shall be temporarily detained to
allow the Pretrial Services Program to prepare a risk assessment with
recommendations on conditions of release pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2014,
c.31 (C.2A:162-25) and for the court to issue a pretrial release decision.</p>

shall make a pretrial release decision for the eligible defendant without
unnecessary delay, but in no case later than 48 hours after the eligible
defendant's commitment to jail.  The court shall consider the Pretrial Services
Program's risk assessment and recommendations on conditions of release before
making any pretrial release decision for the eligible defendant.</p>
