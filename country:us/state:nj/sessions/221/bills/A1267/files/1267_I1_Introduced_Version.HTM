Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 1 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15) is amended to read as follows: 1.    The provisions of sections 1 through 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15 et seq.) shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purpose of primarily relying upon pretrial release by non-monetary means to reasonably assure an eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, and that the eligible defendant will comply with all conditions of release, while authorizing the court, upon motion of a prosecutor, to order pretrial detention of the eligible defendant when, except as otherwise provided in sections 1 through 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15 et seq.), it finds clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the effectuation of these goals. Monetary bail may be set for an eligible defendant only when it is determined that no other conditions of release will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required. For the purposes of sections 1 through 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15 et seq.), "eligible defendant" shall mean a person for whom a complaint-warrant is issued for an initial charge involving an indictable offense or a disorderly persons offense unless otherwise provided in sections 1 through 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2014, c.31, s.1) 2.    Section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16) is amended to read as follows: 2. a. An eligible defendant, following the issuance of a complaint-warrant pursuant to the conditions set forth under subsection c. of this section, shall be temporarily detained to allow the Pretrial Services Program to prepare a risk assessment with recommendations on conditions of release pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-25) and for the court to issue a pretrial release decision. b. (1) Except as otherwise provided under sections 4 and 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18 and C.2A:162-19), the court, pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17), shall make a pretrial release decision for the eligible defendant without unnecessary delay, but in no case later than 48 hours after the eligible defendant's commitment to jail.  The court shall consider the Pretrial Services Program's risk assessment and recommendations on conditions of release before making any pretrial release decision for the eligible defendant. (2)   [After] Except as otherwise provided in this section, after considering all the circumstances, the Pretrial Services Program's risk assessment and recommendations on conditions of release, and any information that may be provided by a prosecutor or the eligible defendant, the court shall order that the eligible defendant be: (a)   released on the eligible defendant's own recognizance or on execution of an unsecured appearance bond; or (b)   released on a non-monetary condition or conditions, with the condition or conditions being the least restrictive condition or combination of conditions that the court determines will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; or (c)   released on monetary bail, other than an unsecured appearance bond, to reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, or a combination of monetary bail and non-monetary conditions, to reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; or (d)   detained in jail, upon motion of the prosecutor, pending a pretrial detention hearing pursuant to sections 4 and 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18 and C.2A:162-19). (3)   Upon motion of the prosecutor, unless the court finds clear and convincing evidence that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, an eligible defendant for whom a complaint-warrant is issued for an initial charge involving a crime of the third or fourth degree who has not previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense shall be: (a)   released on the eligible defendant's own recognizance or on execution of an unsecured appearance bond; or (b)   released on a non-monetary condition or conditions, with the condition or conditions being the least restrictive condition or combination of conditions that the court determines will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; or (c)   released on monetary bail, other than an unsecured appearance bond, to reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, or a combination of monetary bail and non-monetary conditions, to reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. (4)   Upon motion of the prosecutor, an eligible defendant for whom a complaint-warrant is issued for an initial charge involving a crime of the second degree who has not previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense; or for an initial charge involving a crime of the third or fourth degree who has previously been convicted on two or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense, shall be detained pending trial unless the court finds clear and convincing evidence that monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. (5)   Upon motion of the prosecutor, an eligible defendant for whom a complaint-warrant is issued for an initial charge involving a crime of the first degree, or a crime of the second degree if the defendant has previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense, shall be detained pending trial unless the court finds evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. c.     A law enforcement officer shall not apply for a complaint-warrant except in accordance with guidelines issued by the Attorney General, and a court may not issue a complaint-warrant except as may be authorized by the Rules of Court. d.  (1)  A defendant who is charged on a complaint-summons shall be released from custody and shall not be subject to the provisions of sections 1 through 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15 et seq.). (2)  (a)  If a defendant who was released from custody after being charged on a complaint-summons pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection is subsequently arrested on a warrant for failure to appear in court when required, that defendant shall be eligible for release on personal recognizance or release on bail by sufficient sureties at the discretion of the court.  If monetary bail was not set when an arrest warrant for the defendant was issued, the defendant shall have monetary bail set without unnecessary delay, but in no case later than 12 hours after arrest. Pursuant to the Rules of Court, if the defendant is unable to post monetary bail, the defendant shall have that bail reviewed promptly and may file an application with the court seeking a bail reduction, which shall be heard in an expedited manner. (b)   If the defendant fails to post the required monetary bail set by the court pursuant to this paragraph, the defendant may not be detained on the charge or charges contained in the complaint-summons beyond the maximum term of incarceration or term of probation supervision for the offense or offenses charged. (cf: P.L.2014, c.31, s.2) 3.    Section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17) is amended to read as follows: 3.    Except as otherwise provided under sections 4 and 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18 and C.2A:162-19) concerning a hearing on pretrial detention, a court shall make, pursuant to this section, a pretrial release decision for an eligible defendant without unnecessary delay, but in no case later than 48 hours after the eligible defendant's commitment to jail. a.     [The] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16), the court shall order the pretrial release of the eligible defendant on personal recognizance or on the execution of an unsecured appearance bond when, after considering all the circumstances, the Pretrial Services Program's risk assessment and recommendations on conditions of release prepared pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-25), and any information that may be provided by a prosecutor or the eligible defendant, the court finds that the release would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. b.  (1)  If the court does not find, after consideration, that the release described in subsection a. of this section will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, the court may order the pretrial release of the eligible defendant subject to the following: (a)   the eligible defendant shall not commit any offense during the period of release; (b)   the eligible defendant shall avoid all contact with an alleged victim of the crime; (c)   the eligible defendant shall avoid all contact with all witnesses who may testify concerning the offense that are named in the document authorizing the eligible defendant's release or in a subsequent court order; and (d)   any one or more non-monetary conditions as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)   The non-monetary condition or conditions of a pretrial release ordered by the court pursuant to this paragraph shall be the least restrictive condition, or combination of conditions, that the court determines will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, which may include that the eligible defendant: (a)   remain in the custody of a designated person, who agrees to assume supervision and to report any violation of a release condition to the court, if the designated person is able to reasonably assure the court that the eligible defendant will appear in court when required, will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community, and will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; (b)   maintain employment, or, if unemployed, actively seek employment; (c)   maintain or commence an educational program; (d)   abide by specified restrictions on personal associations, place of abode, or travel; (e)   report on a regular basis to a designated law enforcement agency, or other agency, or pretrial services program; (f)   comply with a specified curfew; (g)   refrain from possessing a firearm, destructive device, or other dangerous weapon; (h)   refrain from excessive use of alcohol, or any unlawful use of a narcotic drug or other controlled substance without a prescription by a licensed medical practitioner; (i)    undergo available medical, psychological, or psychiatric treatment, including treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, and remain in a specified institution if required for that purpose; (j)    return to custody for specified hours following release for employment, schooling, or other limited purposes; (k)   be placed in a pretrial home supervision capacity with or without the use of an approved electronic monitoring device.  The court may order the eligible defendant to pay all or a portion of the costs of the electronic monitoring, but the court may waive the payment for an eligible defendant who is indigent and who has demonstrated to the court an inability to pay all or a portion of the costs; or (l)    satisfy any other condition that is necessary to reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, which shall not include any prohibition or restriction concerning manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing, or possessing or having under control with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (12) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5, or possession of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10. c.  (1)  If the court does not find, after consideration, that the release described in subsection a. or b. of this section will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the court may order the pretrial release of the eligible defendant on monetary bail, other than an unsecured appearance bond. The court may only impose monetary bail pursuant to this subsection to reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance.  The court shall not impose the monetary bail to reasonably assure the protection of the safety of any other person or the community or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, or for the purpose of preventing the release of the eligible defendant. (2)   If the eligible defendant is unable to post the monetary bail imposed by the court pursuant to this subsection, and for that reason remains detained in jail, the provisions of section 8 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-22) shall apply to the eligible defendant. d.  (1)  If the court does not find, after consideration, that the release described in subsection a., b., or c. will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, the court may order the pretrial release of the eligible defendant using a combination of non-monetary conditions as set forth in subsection b. of this section, and monetary bail as set forth in subsection c. of this section. (2)   If the eligible defendant is unable to post the monetary bail imposed by the court in combination with non-monetary conditions pursuant to this subsection, and for that reason remains detained in jail, the provisions of section 8 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-22) shall apply to the eligible defendant. e.     For purposes of the court's consideration for pretrial release described in this section, with respect to whether the particular method of release will reasonably assure that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, this reasonable assurance may be deemed to exist if the prosecutor does not provide the court with information relevant to the risk of whether the eligible defendant will obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. (cf: P.L.2021, c.19, s.7) 4.    Section 4 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18) is amended to read as follows: 4.  a.  (1)  The court may order, before trial, the detention of an eligible defendant charged with any crime, or any offense involving domestic violence as defined in subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19), enumerated in subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19), if the prosecutor seeks the pretrial detention of the eligible defendant under section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19) and after a hearing pursuant to that section the court finds that the conditions for pretrial release of an eligible defendant pursuant to subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16), if applicable, are not met, or finds clear and convincing evidence that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of pretrial release or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. The court may also order the pretrial detention of an eligible defendant when the prosecutor moves for a pretrial detention hearing and the eligible defendant fails to rebut a presumption of pretrial detention that may be established for the crimes enumerated under subsection b. of section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19). (2)   For purposes of ordering the pretrial detention of an eligible defendant pursuant to this section and section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19) or pursuant to section 10 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-24), when determining whether no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, the court may consider the amount of monetary bail only with respect to whether it will, by itself or in combination with non-monetary conditions, reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required. b.    Regarding the pretrial detention hearing moved for by the prosecutor, except for when an eligible defendant is charged with a crime set forth under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection b. of section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19), there shall be a rebuttable presumption that some amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of pretrial release or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. c.     An eligible defendant may appeal an order of pretrial detention pursuant to the Rules of Court.  The appeal shall be heard in an expedited manner.  The eligible defendant shall be detained pending the disposition of the appeal. d.    If the court does not order the pretrial detention of an eligible defendant at the conclusion of the pretrial detention hearing under this section and section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19), the court shall order the release of the eligible defendant pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17). (cf: P.L.2014, c.31, s.4) 5.    Section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19) is amended to read as follows: 5.  a.  A prosecutor may file a motion with the court at any time, including any time before or after an eligible defendant's release pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17), seeking the pretrial detention of an eligible defendant for: (1)  any crime of the first or second degree [enumerated under subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.2C:43-7.2)]; (2)  any crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to an ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment; (3)  [any crime if the eligible defendant has been convicted of two or more offenses under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection;] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (4)  any crime enumerated under paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2) or crime involving human trafficking pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.77 (C.2C:13-8) or P.L.2013, c.51 (C.52:17B-237 et al.) when the victim is a minor, or the crime of endangering the welfare of a child under N.J.S.2C:24-4; (5)  any crime enumerated under subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:43-6; (6)  any crime or offense involving domestic violence as defined in subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19); or (7)  any other crime for which the prosecutor believes there is a serious risk that: (a)  the eligible defendant will not appear in court as required; (b)  the eligible defendant will pose a danger to any other person or the community; or (c)  the eligible defendant will obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice, or threaten, injure, or intimidate, or attempt to threaten, injure or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror. b.    When a motion for pretrial detention is filed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the eligible defendant shall be detained pending trial because no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary condition or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process[, if the court finds probable cause that the eligible defendant: (1)  committed murder pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-3; or (2)  committed any crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to an ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment]. c.     A court shall hold a hearing to determine whether any amount of monetary bail or non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary bail and conditions, including those set forth under subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17) will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. d.  (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the pretrial detention hearing shall be held no later than the eligible defendant's first appearance unless the eligible defendant, or the prosecutor, seeks a continuance.  If a prosecutor files a motion for pretrial detention after the eligible defendant's first appearance has taken place or if no first appearance is required, the court shall schedule the pretrial detention hearing to take place within three working days of the date on which the prosecutor's motion was filed, unless the prosecutor or the eligible defendant seeks a continuance.  Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of the eligible defendant may not exceed five days, not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.  Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of the prosecutor may not exceed three days, not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. (2)  Upon the filing of a motion by the prosecutor seeking the pretrial detention of the eligible defendant and during any continuance that may be granted by the court, the eligible defendant shall be detained in jail, unless the eligible defendant was previously released from custody before trial, in which case the court shall issue a notice to appear to compel the appearance of the eligible defendant at the detention hearing.  The court, on motion of the prosecutor or sua sponte, may order that, while in custody, an eligible defendant who appears to be a drug-dependent person receive an assessment to determine whether that eligible defendant is drug-dependent. e.  (1)  At the pretrial detention hearing, the eligible defendant has the right to be represented by counsel, and, if financially unable to obtain adequate representation, to have counsel appointed.  The eligible defendant shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing, and to present information by proffer or otherwise.  The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials shall not apply to the presentation and consideration of information at the hearing. (2)  In pretrial detention proceedings for which there is no indictment, the prosecutor shall establish probable cause that the eligible defendant committed the predicate offense.  A presumption of pretrial detention as provided in subsection b. of this section may be rebutted by proof provided by the eligible defendant, the prosecutor, or from other materials submitted to the court.  The standard of proof for a rebuttal of the presumption of pretrial detention shall be a preponderance of the evidence.  If proof cannot be established to rebut the presumption, the court may order the eligible defendant's pretrial detention.  If the presumption is rebutted by sufficient proof, the prosecutor shall have the opportunity to establish that the grounds for pretrial detention exist pursuant to this section. (3)  Except [when an eligible defendant has failed to rebut a presumption of pretrial detention pursuant to] as otherwise provided in this section and subsection b. of [this section] section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16), the court's finding to support an order of pretrial detention pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18) that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary bail and conditions will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence. f.     The hearing may be reopened, before or after a determination by the court, at any time before trial, if the court finds that information exists that was not known to the prosecutor or the eligible defendant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. g.    When a motion for pretrial detention is filed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, a pretrial recommendation of no release pursuant to subsection f. of section 6 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-20) may constitute prima facie evidence to overcome the presumption of release as set forth in subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18), if the court finds probable cause that the eligible defendant committed any crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to a mandatory term of imprisonment pursuant to subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:43-6 for a crime involving the use or possession of a firearm other than a violation of: (1) subsection a. or d. of N.J.S.2C:39-3; (2) paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:39-4; (3)  subsection a. of section 1 of P.L. 1998, c.26 (C.2C:39-4.1); or (4)  paragraph (1) of subsection b. or paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:39-5. (cf: P.L.2022, c.43, s.1) 6.    Section 7 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-21) is amended to read as follows: 7.  a.  In a pretrial detention order issued pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16) or sections 4 and 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18 and C.2A:162-19), the court shall: (1)   include written findings of fact and a written statement of the reasons for the detention; and (2)   direct that the eligible defendant be afforded reasonable opportunity for private consultation with counsel. b.    The court may, by subsequent order, permit the temporary release of the eligible defendant subject to appropriate restrictive conditions, which may include but shall not be limited to pretrial supervision, to the extent that the court determines the release to be necessary for preparation of the eligible defendant's defense or for another compelling reason. (cf: P.L.2014, c.31, s.7) 7.    Section 8 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-22) is amended to read as follows: 8. a. Concerning an eligible defendant subject to pretrial detention as ordered by a court pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16) or sections 4 and 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18 and C.2A:162-19) or an eligible defendant who is detained in jail due to the inability to post the monetary bail imposed by the court pursuant to subsection c. or d. of section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17): (1)  (a)  The eligible defendant shall not remain detained in jail for more than 90 days, not counting excludable time for reasonable delays as set forth in subsection b. of this section, prior to the return of an indictment.  If the eligible defendant is not indicted within that period of time, the eligible defendant shall be released from jail unless, on motion of the prosecutor, the court finds that a substantial and unjustifiable risk to the safety of any other person or the community or the obstruction of the criminal justice process would result from the eligible defendant's release from custody, so that no appropriate conditions for the eligible defendant's release could reasonably address that risk, and also finds that the failure to indict the eligible defendant in accordance with the time requirement set forth in this subparagraph was not due to unreasonable delay by the prosecutor.  If the court finds that a substantial and unjustifiable risk to the safety of any other person or the community or the obstruction of the criminal justice process would result, and also finds that the failure to indict the eligible defendant in accordance with the time requirement set forth in this subparagraph was not due to unreasonable delay by the prosecutor, the court may allocate an additional period of time, not to exceed 45 days, in which the return of an indictment shall occur. Notwithstanding the court's previous findings for ordering the eligible defendant's pretrial detention, or if the court currently does not find a substantial and unjustifiable risk or finds unreasonable delay by the prosecutor as described in this subparagraph, the court shall order the release of the eligible defendant pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17). (b)   If the eligible defendant is charged or indicted on another matter resulting in the eligible defendant's pretrial detention, the time calculations set forth in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph for each matter shall run independently. (2)  (a)  An eligible defendant who has been indicted shall not remain detained in jail for more than 180 days on that charge following the return or unsealing of the indictment, whichever is later, not counting excludable time for reasonable delays as set forth in subsection b. of this section, before commencement of the trial.  If the trial does not commence within that period of time, the eligible defendant shall be released from jail unless, on motion of the prosecutor, the court finds that a substantial and unjustifiable risk to the safety of any other person or the community or the obstruction of the criminal justice process would result from the eligible defendant's release from custody, so that no appropriate conditions for the eligible defendant's release could reasonably address that risk, and also finds that the failure to commence trial in accordance with the time requirement set forth in this subparagraph was not due to unreasonable delay by the prosecutor.  If the court finds that a substantial and unjustifiable risk to the safety of any other person or the community or the obstruction of the criminal justice process would result, and also finds that the failure to commence trial in accordance with the time requirement set forth in this subparagraph was not due to unreasonable delay by the prosecutor, the court may allocate an additional period of time in which the eligible defendant's trial shall commence. Notwithstanding the court's previous findings for ordering the eligible defendant's pretrial detention, or if the court currently does not find a substantial and unjustifiable risk or finds unreasonable delay by the prosecutor as described in this subparagraph, the court shall order the release of the eligible defendant pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17).  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an eligible defendant shall be released from jail pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17) after a release hearing if, two years after the court's issuance of the pretrial detention order for the eligible defendant, excluding any delays attributable to the eligible defendant, the prosecutor is not ready to proceed to voir dire or to opening argument, or to the hearing of any motions that had been reserved for the time of trial. (b)  (i)  For the purposes of this paragraph, a trial is considered to have commenced when the court determines that the parties are present and directs them to proceed to voir dire or to opening argument, or to the hearing of any motions that had been reserved for the time of trial. (ii)   The return of a superseding indictment against the eligible defendant shall extend the time for the trial to commence. (iii)  If an indictment is dismissed without prejudice upon motion of the eligible defendant for any reason, and a subsequent indictment is returned, the time for trial shall begin running from the date of the return of the subsequent indictment. (iv)  A trial ordered after a mistrial or upon a motion for a new trial shall commence within 120 days of the entry of the order of the court.  A trial ordered upon the reversal of a judgment by any appellate court shall commence within 120 days of the service of that court's trial mandate. (c)   If the eligible defendant is indicted on another matter resulting in the eligible defendant's pretrial detention, the time calculations set forth in this paragraph for each matter shall run independently. b.  (1)   The following periods shall be excluded in computing the time in which a case shall be indicted or tried: (a)   The time resulting from an examination and hearing on competency and the period during which the eligible defendant is incompetent to stand trial or incapacitated; (b)   The time from the filing to the disposition of an eligible defendant's application for supervisory treatment pursuant to N.J.S.2C:36A-1 or N.J.S.2C:43-12 et seq., special probation pursuant to N.J.S.2C:35-14, drug or alcohol treatment as a condition of probation pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1, or other pretrial treatment or supervisory program; (c)   The time from the filing to the final disposition of a motion made before trial by the prosecutor or the eligible defendant; (d)   The time resulting from a continuance granted, in the court's discretion, at the eligible defendant's request or at the request of both the eligible defendant and the prosecutor; (e)   The time resulting from the detention of an eligible defendant in another jurisdiction provided the prosecutor has been diligent and has made reasonable efforts to obtain the eligible defendant's presence; (f)   The time resulting from exceptional circumstances including, but not limited to, a natural disaster, the unavoidable unavailability of an eligible defendant, material witness or other evidence, when there is a reasonable expectation that the eligible defendant, witness or evidence will become available in the near future; (g)   On motion of the prosecutor, the delay resulting when the court finds that the case is complex due to the number of defendants or the nature of the prosecution; (h)   The time resulting from a severance of codefendants when that severance permits only one trial to commence within the time period for trial set forth in this section; (i)    The time resulting from an eligible defendant's failure to appear for a court proceeding; (j)    The time resulting from a disqualification or recusal of a judge; (k)   The time resulting from a failure by the eligible defendant to provide timely and complete discovery; (l) The time for other periods of delay not specifically enumerated if the court finds good cause for the delay; and (m)  Any other time otherwise required by statute. (2)   The failure by the prosecutor to provide timely and complete discovery shall not be considered excludable time unless the discovery only became available after the time set for discovery. (cf: P.L.2014, c.31, s.8) 8.    Section 10 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-24) is amended to read as follows: 10.  a.  Upon motion of a prosecutor, when an eligible defendant is released from custody before trial pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16), section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17), or section 8 of P.L.2014, c.31 ([C.2A:162-17 or] C.2A:162-22), the court, upon a finding that the eligible defendant while on release has violated a restraining order or condition of release, or upon a finding of probable cause to believe that the eligible defendant has committed a new crime while on release, [may not] shall revoke the eligible defendant's release and order that the eligible defendant be detained pending trial unless the court, after considering all relevant circumstances including but not limited to the nature and seriousness of the violation or criminal act committed, finds clear and convincing evidence that [no] monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. b.    A court shall not revoke an eligible defendant's release and order that the eligible defendant be detained pending trial based on manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing, or possessing or having under control with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (12) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5, or possession of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10. (cf: P.L.2021, c.19, s.9) 9.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill restricts the pretrial release of certain defendants charged with a crime of the first degree and certain repeat offenders, and provides conditions for pretrial release of certain first-time offenders charged with lower-level crimes. It is the sponsors intent to ensure more uniform application of the States criminal laws, and reduce the number of defendants charged with violent crimes being released pending trial. Under P.L.2014, c.31, also known as the Criminal Justice Reform Law or bail reform, criminal courts are authorized to order the pretrial release of a defendant pending further proceedings, or order pretrial detention of a defendant who is found to be a flight risk, a danger to another or the community, or likely to obstruct further criminal proceedings. Pretrial detention determinations are based on a risk assessment conducted by the Pretrial Services Program, which assesses each eligible defendant detained on a complaint-warrant and makes recommendations to the court as to an appropriate pretrial release decision. Under current law, there is a rebuttable presumption for some form of pretrial release, except with respect to an eligible defendant charged with murder or a crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to an ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment. This bill establishes a strict standard that must be met in order for a court to order the pretrial release of these defendants, as well as certain repeat offenders.  The bill would also set conditions for the pretrial release of first-time offenders charged with less serious crimes. Under the bill, upon motion of the prosecutor: · a defendant charged with any crime of the first degree; or a crime of the second degree if the defendant has previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense, are to be detained pending trial unless the court finds evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; · a defendant charged with a crime of the second degree who has not previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense; or a crime of the third or fourth degree who has previously been convicted on two or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense is to be detained pending trial unless the court finds clear and convincing evidence that monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; and · an eligible defendant charged with a crime of the third or fourth degree who has not previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense is to be released pending trial unless the court finds clear and convincing evidence that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; Current law also provides that a court may revoke a defendants pretrial release and order detention pending trial if the defendant violates a condition of release or commits a new crime while on release, but only if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that no monetary bail or conditions of release would reasonably assure the defendant's appearance in court and the publics safety, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. Under current law, the lowest level distribution offenses involving marijuana or hashish, and possession of marijuana or hashish, are not to be considered a violation of the terms of pretrial release. This bill, instead, provides that if a defendant violates any condition of pretrial release, or commits any crime while on release, the court is required to revoke the pretrial release and order the defendant to be detained pending trial, unless it finds by clear and convincing evidence that monetary bail or conditions of release would reasonably assure the defendant's appearance in court and the publics safety, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process.

Monetary bail may be set for an eligible defendant only when it is determined that no other conditions of release will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required. For the purposes of sections 1 through 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15 et seq.), "eligible defendant" shall mean a person for whom a complaint-warrant is issued for an initial charge involving an indictable offense or a disorderly persons offense unless otherwise provided in sections 1 through 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15 et seq.).

An eligible defendant, following the issuance of a complaint-warrant pursuant to the conditions set forth under subsection c. of this section, shall be temporarily detained to allow the Pretrial Services Program to prepare a risk assessment with recommendations on conditions of release pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-25) and for the court to issue a pretrial release decision. b. (1) Except as otherwise provided under sections 4 and 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18 and C.2A:162-19), the court, pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17), shall make a pretrial release decision for the eligible defendant without unnecessary delay, but in no case later than 48 hours after the eligible defendant's commitment to jail.  The court shall consider the Pretrial Services Program's risk assessment and recommendations on conditions of release before making any pretrial release decision for the eligible defendant.

(3)   Upon motion of the prosecutor, unless the court finds clear and convincing evidence that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, an eligible defendant for whom a complaint-warrant is issued for an initial charge involving a crime of the third or fourth degree who has not previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense shall be: (a)   released on the eligible defendant's own recognizance or on execution of an unsecured appearance bond; or (b)   released on a non-monetary condition or conditions, with the condition or conditions being the least restrictive condition or combination of conditions that the court determines will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; or (c)   released on monetary bail, other than an unsecured appearance bond, to reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, or a combination of monetary bail and non-monetary conditions, to reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process.

(5)   Upon motion of the prosecutor, an eligible defendant for whom a complaint-warrant is issued for an initial charge involving a crime of the first degree, or a crime of the second degree if the defendant has previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense, shall be detained pending trial unless the court finds evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. c.     A law enforcement officer shall not apply for a complaint-warrant except in accordance with guidelines issued by the Attorney General, and a court may not issue a complaint-warrant except as may be authorized by the Rules of Court. d.  (1)  A defendant who is charged on a complaint-summons shall be released from custody and shall not be subject to the provisions of sections 1 through 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-15 et seq.).

Pursuant to the Rules of Court, if the defendant is unable to post monetary bail, the defendant shall have that bail reviewed promptly and may file an application with the court seeking a bail reduction, which shall be heard in an expedited manner. (b)   If the defendant fails to post the required monetary bail set by the court pursuant to this paragraph, the defendant may not be detained on the charge or charges contained in the complaint-summons beyond the maximum term of incarceration or term of probation supervision for the offense or offenses charged. (cf: P.L.2014, c.31, s.2) 3.    Section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17) is amended to read as follows: 3.    Except as otherwise provided under sections 4 and 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18 and C.2A:162-19) concerning a hearing on pretrial detention, a court shall make, pursuant to this section, a pretrial release decision for an eligible defendant without unnecessary delay, but in no case later than 48 hours after the eligible defendant's commitment to jail. a.     [The] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16), the court shall order the pretrial release of the eligible defendant on personal recognizance or on the execution of an unsecured appearance bond when, after considering all the circumstances, the Pretrial Services Program's risk assessment and recommendations on conditions of release prepared pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-25), and any information that may be provided by a prosecutor or the eligible defendant, the court finds that the release would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. b.  (1)  If the court does not find, after consideration, that the release described in subsection a. of this section will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, the court may order the pretrial release of the eligible defendant subject to the following: (a)   the eligible defendant shall not commit any offense during the period of release; (b)   the eligible defendant shall avoid all contact with an alleged victim of the crime; (c)   the eligible defendant shall avoid all contact with all witnesses who may testify concerning the offense that are named in the document authorizing the eligible defendant's release or in a subsequent court order; and (d)   any one or more non-monetary conditions as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)   The non-monetary condition or conditions of a pretrial release ordered by the court pursuant to this paragraph shall be the least restrictive condition, or combination of conditions, that the court determines will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, which may include that the eligible defendant: (a)   remain in the custody of a designated person, who agrees to assume supervision and to report any violation of a release condition to the court, if the designated person is able to reasonably assure the court that the eligible defendant will appear in court when required, will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community, and will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; (b)   maintain employment, or, if unemployed, actively seek employment; (c)   maintain or commence an educational program; (d)   abide by specified restrictions on personal associations, place of abode, or travel; (e)   report on a regular basis to a designated law enforcement agency, or other agency, or pretrial services program; (f)   comply with a specified curfew; (g)   refrain from possessing a firearm, destructive device, or other dangerous weapon; (h)   refrain from excessive use of alcohol, or any unlawful use of a narcotic drug or other controlled substance without a prescription by a licensed medical practitioner; (i)    undergo available medical, psychological, or psychiatric treatment, including treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, and remain in a specified institution if required for that purpose; (j)    return to custody for specified hours following release for employment, schooling, or other limited purposes; (k)   be placed in a pretrial home supervision capacity with or without the use of an approved electronic monitoring device.  The court may order the eligible defendant to pay all or a portion of the costs of the electronic monitoring, but the court may waive the payment for an eligible defendant who is indigent and who has demonstrated to the court an inability to pay all or a portion of the costs; or (l)    satisfy any other condition that is necessary to reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, which shall not include any prohibition or restriction concerning manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing, or possessing or having under control with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (12) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5, or possession of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10. c.  (1)  If the court does not find, after consideration, that the release described in subsection a. or b. of this section will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the court may order the pretrial release of the eligible defendant on monetary bail, other than an unsecured appearance bond. The court may only impose monetary bail pursuant to this subsection to reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance.  The court shall not impose the monetary bail to reasonably assure the protection of the safety of any other person or the community or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, or for the purpose of preventing the release of the eligible defendant. (2)   If the eligible defendant is unable to post the monetary bail imposed by the court pursuant to this subsection, and for that reason remains detained in jail, the provisions of section 8 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-22) shall apply to the eligible defendant. d.  (1)  If the court does not find, after consideration, that the release described in subsection a., b., or c. will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, the court may order the pretrial release of the eligible defendant using a combination of non-monetary conditions as set forth in subsection b. of this section, and monetary bail as set forth in subsection c. of this section. (2)   If the eligible defendant is unable to post the monetary bail imposed by the court in combination with non-monetary conditions pursuant to this subsection, and for that reason remains detained in jail, the provisions of section 8 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-22) shall apply to the eligible defendant. e.     For purposes of the court's consideration for pretrial release described in this section, with respect to whether the particular method of release will reasonably assure that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, this reasonable assurance may be deemed to exist if the prosecutor does not provide the court with information relevant to the risk of whether the eligible defendant will obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. (cf: P.L.2021, c.19, s.7) 4.    Section 4 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18) is amended to read as follows: 4.  a.  (1)  The court may order, before trial, the detention of an eligible defendant charged with any crime, or any offense involving domestic violence as defined in subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19), enumerated in subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19), if the prosecutor seeks the pretrial detention of the eligible defendant under section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19) and after a hearing pursuant to that section the court finds that the conditions for pretrial release of an eligible defendant pursuant to subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16), if applicable, are not met, or finds clear and convincing evidence that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of pretrial release or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. The court may also order the pretrial detention of an eligible defendant when the prosecutor moves for a pretrial detention hearing and the eligible defendant fails to rebut a presumption of pretrial detention that may be established for the crimes enumerated under subsection b. of section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19). (2)   For purposes of ordering the pretrial detention of an eligible defendant pursuant to this section and section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19) or pursuant to section 10 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-24), when determining whether no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, the court may consider the amount of monetary bail only with respect to whether it will, by itself or in combination with non-monetary conditions, reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required. b.    Regarding the pretrial detention hearing moved for by the prosecutor, except for when an eligible defendant is charged with a crime set forth under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection b. of section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19), there shall be a rebuttable presumption that some amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of pretrial release or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. c.     An eligible defendant may appeal an order of pretrial detention pursuant to the Rules of Court.  The appeal shall be heard in an expedited manner.  The eligible defendant shall be detained pending the disposition of the appeal. d.    If the court does not order the pretrial detention of an eligible defendant at the conclusion of the pretrial detention hearing under this section and section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19), the court shall order the release of the eligible defendant pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17). (cf: P.L.2014, c.31, s.4) 5.    Section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19) is amended to read as follows: 5.  a.  A prosecutor may file a motion with the court at any time, including any time before or after an eligible defendant's release pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17), seeking the pretrial detention of an eligible defendant for: (1)  any crime of the first or second degree [enumerated under subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.2C:43-7.2)]; (2)  any crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to an ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment; (3)  [any crime if the eligible defendant has been convicted of two or more offenses under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection;] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (4)  any crime enumerated under paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2) or crime involving human trafficking pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.77 (C.2C:13-8) or P.L.2013, c.51 (C.52:17B-237 et al.) when the victim is a minor, or the crime of endangering the welfare of a child under N.J.S.2C:24-4; (5)  any crime enumerated under subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:43-6; (6)  any crime or offense involving domestic violence as defined in subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19); or (7)  any other crime for which the prosecutor believes there is a serious risk that: (a)  the eligible defendant will not appear in court as required; (b)  the eligible defendant will pose a danger to any other person or the community; or (c)  the eligible defendant will obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice, or threaten, injure, or intimidate, or attempt to threaten, injure or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror. b.    When a motion for pretrial detention is filed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the eligible defendant shall be detained pending trial because no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary condition or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process[, if the court finds probable cause that the eligible defendant: (1)  committed murder pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-3; or (2)  committed any crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to an ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment]. c.     A court shall hold a hearing to determine whether any amount of monetary bail or non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary bail and conditions, including those set forth under subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17) will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. d.  (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the pretrial detention hearing shall be held no later than the eligible defendant's first appearance unless the eligible defendant, or the prosecutor, seeks a continuance.  If a prosecutor files a motion for pretrial detention after the eligible defendant's first appearance has taken place or if no first appearance is required, the court shall schedule the pretrial detention hearing to take place within three working days of the date on which the prosecutor's motion was filed, unless the prosecutor or the eligible defendant seeks a continuance.  Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of the eligible defendant may not exceed five days, not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.  Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of the prosecutor may not exceed three days, not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. (2)  Upon the filing of a motion by the prosecutor seeking the pretrial detention of the eligible defendant and during any continuance that may be granted by the court, the eligible defendant shall be detained in jail, unless the eligible defendant was previously released from custody before trial, in which case the court shall issue a notice to appear to compel the appearance of the eligible defendant at the detention hearing.  The court, on motion of the prosecutor or sua sponte, may order that, while in custody, an eligible defendant who appears to be a drug-dependent person receive an assessment to determine whether that eligible defendant is drug-dependent. e.  (1)  At the pretrial detention hearing, the eligible defendant has the right to be represented by counsel, and, if financially unable to obtain adequate representation, to have counsel appointed.  The eligible defendant shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing, and to present information by proffer or otherwise.  The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials shall not apply to the presentation and consideration of information at the hearing. (2)  In pretrial detention proceedings for which there is no indictment, the prosecutor shall establish probable cause that the eligible defendant committed the predicate offense.  A presumption of pretrial detention as provided in subsection b. of this section may be rebutted by proof provided by the eligible defendant, the prosecutor, or from other materials submitted to the court.  The standard of proof for a rebuttal of the presumption of pretrial detention shall be a preponderance of the evidence.  If proof cannot be established to rebut the presumption, the court may order the eligible defendant's pretrial detention.  If the presumption is rebutted by sufficient proof, the prosecutor shall have the opportunity to establish that the grounds for pretrial detention exist pursuant to this section. (3)  Except [when an eligible defendant has failed to rebut a presumption of pretrial detention pursuant to] as otherwise provided in this section and subsection b. of [this section] section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16), the court's finding to support an order of pretrial detention pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18) that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary bail and conditions will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence. f.     The hearing may be reopened, before or after a determination by the court, at any time before trial, if the court finds that information exists that was not known to the prosecutor or the eligible defendant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. g.    When a motion for pretrial detention is filed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, a pretrial recommendation of no release pursuant to subsection f. of section 6 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-20) may constitute prima facie evidence to overcome the presumption of release as set forth in subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18), if the court finds probable cause that the eligible defendant committed any crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to a mandatory term of imprisonment pursuant to subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:43-6 for a crime involving the use or possession of a firearm other than a violation of: (1) subsection a. or d. of N.J.S.2C:39-3; (2) paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:39-4; (3)  subsection a. of section 1 of P.L. 1998, c.26 (C.2C:39-4.1); or (4)  paragraph (1) of subsection b. or paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:39-5. (cf: P.L.2022, c.43, s.1) 6.    Section 7 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-21) is amended to read as follows: 7.  a.  In a pretrial detention order issued pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16) or sections 4 and 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18 and C.2A:162-19), the court shall: (1)   include written findings of fact and a written statement of the reasons for the detention; and (2)   direct that the eligible defendant be afforded reasonable opportunity for private consultation with counsel. b.    The court may, by subsequent order, permit the temporary release of the eligible defendant subject to appropriate restrictive conditions, which may include but shall not be limited to pretrial supervision, to the extent that the court determines the release to be necessary for preparation of the eligible defendant's defense or for another compelling reason. (cf: P.L.2014, c.31, s.7) 7.    Section 8 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-22) is amended to read as follows: 8. a. Concerning an eligible defendant subject to pretrial detention as ordered by a court pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16) or sections 4 and 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18 and C.2A:162-19) or an eligible defendant who is detained in jail due to the inability to post the monetary bail imposed by the court pursuant to subsection c. or d. of section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17): (1)  (a)  The eligible defendant shall not remain detained in jail for more than 90 days, not counting excludable time for reasonable delays as set forth in subsection b. of this section, prior to the return of an indictment.  If the eligible defendant is not indicted within that period of time, the eligible defendant shall be released from jail unless, on motion of the prosecutor, the court finds that a substantial and unjustifiable risk to the safety of any other person or the community or the obstruction of the criminal justice process would result from the eligible defendant's release from custody, so that no appropriate conditions for the eligible defendant's release could reasonably address that risk, and also finds that the failure to indict the eligible defendant in accordance with the time requirement set forth in this subparagraph was not due to unreasonable delay by the prosecutor.  If the court finds that a substantial and unjustifiable risk to the safety of any other person or the community or the obstruction of the criminal justice process would result, and also finds that the failure to indict the eligible defendant in accordance with the time requirement set forth in this subparagraph was not due to unreasonable delay by the prosecutor, the court may allocate an additional period of time, not to exceed 45 days, in which the return of an indictment shall occur. Notwithstanding the court's previous findings for ordering the eligible defendant's pretrial detention, or if the court currently does not find a substantial and unjustifiable risk or finds unreasonable delay by the prosecutor as described in this subparagraph, the court shall order the release of the eligible defendant pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17). (b)   If the eligible defendant is charged or indicted on another matter resulting in the eligible defendant's pretrial detention, the time calculations set forth in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph for each matter shall run independently. (2)  (a)  An eligible defendant who has been indicted shall not remain detained in jail for more than 180 days on that charge following the return or unsealing of the indictment, whichever is later, not counting excludable time for reasonable delays as set forth in subsection b. of this section, before commencement of the trial.  If the trial does not commence within that period of time, the eligible defendant shall be released from jail unless, on motion of the prosecutor, the court finds that a substantial and unjustifiable risk to the safety of any other person or the community or the obstruction of the criminal justice process would result from the eligible defendant's release from custody, so that no appropriate conditions for the eligible defendant's release could reasonably address that risk, and also finds that the failure to commence trial in accordance with the time requirement set forth in this subparagraph was not due to unreasonable delay by the prosecutor.  If the court finds that a substantial and unjustifiable risk to the safety of any other person or the community or the obstruction of the criminal justice process would result, and also finds that the failure to commence trial in accordance with the time requirement set forth in this subparagraph was not due to unreasonable delay by the prosecutor, the court may allocate an additional period of time in which the eligible defendant's trial shall commence. Notwithstanding the court's previous findings for ordering the eligible defendant's pretrial detention, or if the court currently does not find a substantial and unjustifiable risk or finds unreasonable delay by the prosecutor as described in this subparagraph, the court shall order the release of the eligible defendant pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17).  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an eligible defendant shall be released from jail pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17) after a release hearing if, two years after the court's issuance of the pretrial detention order for the eligible defendant, excluding any delays attributable to the eligible defendant, the prosecutor is not ready to proceed to voir dire or to opening argument, or to the hearing of any motions that had been reserved for the time of trial. (b)  (i)  For the purposes of this paragraph, a trial is considered to have commenced when the court determines that the parties are present and directs them to proceed to voir dire or to opening argument, or to the hearing of any motions that had been reserved for the time of trial. (ii)   The return of a superseding indictment against the eligible defendant shall extend the time for the trial to commence. (iii)  If an indictment is dismissed without prejudice upon motion of the eligible defendant for any reason, and a subsequent indictment is returned, the time for trial shall begin running from the date of the return of the subsequent indictment. (iv)  A trial ordered after a mistrial or upon a motion for a new trial shall commence within 120 days of the entry of the order of the court.  A trial ordered upon the reversal of a judgment by any appellate court shall commence within 120 days of the service of that court's trial mandate. (c)   If the eligible defendant is indicted on another matter resulting in the eligible defendant's pretrial detention, the time calculations set forth in this paragraph for each matter shall run independently. b.  (1)   The following periods shall be excluded in computing the time in which a case shall be indicted or tried: (a)   The time resulting from an examination and hearing on competency and the period during which the eligible defendant is incompetent to stand trial or incapacitated; (b)   The time from the filing to the disposition of an eligible defendant's application for supervisory treatment pursuant to N.J.S.2C:36A-1 or N.J.S.2C:43-12 et seq., special probation pursuant to N.J.S.2C:35-14, drug or alcohol treatment as a condition of probation pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1, or other pretrial treatment or supervisory program; (c)   The time from the filing to the final disposition of a motion made before trial by the prosecutor or the eligible defendant; (d)   The time resulting from a continuance granted, in the court's discretion, at the eligible defendant's request or at the request of both the eligible defendant and the prosecutor; (e)   The time resulting from the detention of an eligible defendant in another jurisdiction provided the prosecutor has been diligent and has made reasonable efforts to obtain the eligible defendant's presence; (f)   The time resulting from exceptional circumstances including, but not limited to, a natural disaster, the unavoidable unavailability of an eligible defendant, material witness or other evidence, when there is a reasonable expectation that the eligible defendant, witness or evidence will become available in the near future; (g)   On motion of the prosecutor, the delay resulting when the court finds that the case is complex due to the number of defendants or the nature of the prosecution; (h)   The time resulting from a severance of codefendants when that severance permits only one trial to commence within the time period for trial set forth in this section; (i)    The time resulting from an eligible defendant's failure to appear for a court proceeding; (j)    The time resulting from a disqualification or recusal of a judge; (k)   The time resulting from a failure by the eligible defendant to provide timely and complete discovery; (l) The time for other periods of delay not specifically enumerated if the court finds good cause for the delay; and (m)  Any other time otherwise required by statute. (2)   The failure by the prosecutor to provide timely and complete discovery shall not be considered excludable time unless the discovery only became available after the time set for discovery. (cf: P.L.2014, c.31, s.8) 8.    Section 10 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-24) is amended to read as follows: 10.  a.  Upon motion of a prosecutor, when an eligible defendant is released from custody before trial pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-16), section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17), or section 8 of P.L.2014, c.31 ([C.2A:162-17 or] C.2A:162-22), the court, upon a finding that the eligible defendant while on release has violated a restraining order or condition of release, or upon a finding of probable cause to believe that the eligible defendant has committed a new crime while on release, [may not] shall revoke the eligible defendant's release and order that the eligible defendant be detained pending trial unless the court, after considering all relevant circumstances including but not limited to the nature and seriousness of the violation or criminal act committed, finds clear and convincing evidence that [no] monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. b.    A court shall not revoke an eligible defendant's release and order that the eligible defendant be detained pending trial based on manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing, or possessing or having under control with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (12) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5, or possession of marijuana or hashish in violation of paragraph (3) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10. (cf: P.L.2021, c.19, s.9) 9.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill restricts the pretrial release of certain defendants charged with a crime of the first degree and certain repeat offenders, and provides conditions for pretrial release of certain first-time offenders charged with lower-level crimes. It is the sponsors intent to ensure more uniform application of the States criminal laws, and reduce the number of defendants charged with violent crimes being released pending trial. Under P.L.2014, c.31, also known as the Criminal Justice Reform Law or bail reform, criminal courts are authorized to order the pretrial release of a defendant pending further proceedings, or order pretrial detention of a defendant who is found to be a flight risk, a danger to another or the community, or likely to obstruct further criminal proceedings. Pretrial detention determinations are based on a risk assessment conducted by the Pretrial Services Program, which assesses each eligible defendant detained on a complaint-warrant and makes recommendations to the court as to an appropriate pretrial release decision. Under current law, there is a rebuttable presumption for some form of pretrial release, except with respect to an eligible defendant charged with murder or a crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to an ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment. This bill establishes a strict standard that must be met in order for a court to order the pretrial release of these defendants, as well as certain repeat offenders.  The bill would also set conditions for the pretrial release of first-time offenders charged with less serious crimes. Under the bill, upon motion of the prosecutor: · a defendant charged with any crime of the first degree; or a crime of the second degree if the defendant has previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense, are to be detained pending trial unless the court finds evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; · a defendant charged with a crime of the second degree who has not previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense; or a crime of the third or fourth degree who has previously been convicted on two or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense is to be detained pending trial unless the court finds clear and convincing evidence that monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; and · an eligible defendant charged with a crime of the third or fourth degree who has not previously been convicted on one or more prior and separate occasions of an indictable offense is to be released pending trial unless the court finds clear and convincing evidence that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release, or a combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process; Current law also provides that a court may revoke a defendants pretrial release and order detention pending trial if the defendant violates a condition of release or commits a new crime while on release, but only if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that no monetary bail or conditions of release would reasonably assure the defendant's appearance in court and the publics safety, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. Under current law, the lowest level distribution offenses involving marijuana or hashish, and possession of marijuana or hashish, are not to be considered a violation of the terms of pretrial release. This bill, instead, provides that if a defendant violates any condition of pretrial release, or commits any crime while on release, the court is required to revoke the pretrial release and order the defendant to be detained pending trial, unless it finds by clear and convincing evidence that monetary bail or conditions of release would reasonably assure the defendant's appearance in court and the publics safety, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process.
