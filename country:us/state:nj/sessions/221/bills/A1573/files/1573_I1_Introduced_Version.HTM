<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    a.  The commission shall
exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in the
interstate compact and the rules adopted thereunder.  Rules and amendments
shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commission shall
promulgate reasonable rules to achieve the intent and purpose of the interstate
compact.  In the event the commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a
manner that is beyond the purpose and intent of the interstate compact, or the
powers granted hereunder, then the action by the commission shall be invalid
and have no force and effect of law in the member states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If a majority of the
legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a statute or
resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within four years of
the date of adoption of the rule, then the rule shall have no further force and
effect in any member state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Rules or amendments to
the rules shall be adopted or ratified at a regular or special meeting of the

an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule
with 48 hours notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual
rulemaking procedures shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety 90 days after the effective
date of the rule.  For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one
that needs to be adopted immediately in order to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   meet an imminent threat
to public health, safety, or welfare;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  a.  Oversight</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The executive and
judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce the
compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the
compacts purposes and intent.  The provisions of the compact shall have
standing as statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Venue is proper and
judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and
exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of
the commission is located.  The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional
defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative
dispute resolution proceedings.  Nothing herein shall affect or limit the
selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional
malpractice, misconduct, or any similar matter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   All courts and all
administrative agencies shall take judicial notice of the compact, the rules of
the commission, and any information provided to a member state pursuant thereto
in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding in a member state pertaining to
the subject matter of the compact, or which may affect the powers,
responsibilities, or actions of the commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The commission shall be
entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to
intervene in a proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide the commission
service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission,
the compact, or promulgated rules. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Default, Technical
Assistance, and Termination</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)    If the commission
determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
obligations or responsibilities under the compact or the promulgated rules, the
commission shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   provide written notice
to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default,
the proposed means of curing the default or any other action to be taken by the
commission; and</p>

training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   If a state in default
fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of the
member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on the state
by the compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure
of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or
liabilities incurred during the period of default. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Termination of
membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of
securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or
terminate shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and
minority leaders of the defaulting states legislature, the state licensing
authority, and each of the member states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A state that has been
terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
extend beyond the effective date of termination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   The commission shall not
bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has
been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
commission and the defaulting state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The defaulting state may
appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission
has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees. </p>

commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with

sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  If judicial enforcement
is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of litigation,
including reasonable attorneys fees.  The remedies herein shall not be the
exclusive remedies of the commission.  The commission may pursue any other
remedies available under federal or state law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill enacts in New Jersey
the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact.  The terms of the compact make it
effective for its signatories upon its adoption by at least 10 states.  The
purpose of the compact is to facilitate the mobility of teachers across the
member states with the goal of supporting teachers through a new and expedited
pathway to licensure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each compact member state is
to define, compile, and update as necessary, a list of eligible licenses that
the state is willing to consider for equivalency under the compact and provide
the list to the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact Commission, which is
established under the bill.  The compact is applicable to the mobility of
unencumbered licenses which is defined as a current, valid authorization
issued by a member states licensing authority allowing an individual to serve
as a teacher in P-12 public education settings.  Under the compact, an
unencumbered license is not a restricted, probationary, provisional,
substitute or temporary credential.  However, active military members and
eligible military spouses may seek to exchange with a member state a
restricted, probationary, provisional, substitute, or temporary credential.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon receipt of an application
for licensure by a teacher holding an eligible license, the receiving state is
to determine which of the receiving states eligible licenses the teacher is
eligible to hold and grant that license to the applicant teacher.  The decision
to grant the license is made at the sole discretion of the receiving states
licensing authority and may include a determination that the applicant is not
eligible for any of the receiving states eligible licenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of an active
military member and eligible military spouse, the receiving state is to grant
an equivalent license that, in the receiving districts sole discretion, is
equivalent to the license held by the teacher in any other member state, except
where the receiving state does not have an equivalent license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of a teacher
holding a career and technical education license, the receiving state is to
grant a license that, in the receiving states sole discretion, is equivalent
to the license held by the applicant teacher and issued by another member
state; except where a career and technical education teacher does not hold a
bachelors degree and the receiving state requires a bachelors degree for
licenses to teach career and technical education.  A receiving state may
require career and technical education teachers to meet state industry
recognized requirements, if required by law in the receiving state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The compact stipulates that it
is not to be construed to limit or inhibit the power of a member state to
regulate licensure or endorsements overseen by the member states licensing
authority.  Also, nothing in the compact is to be construed to invalidate or
alter any existing agreement or other cooperative arrangement to which a member
state may already be a party, or limit the ability of a state to participate in
any future agreement or cooperative arrangement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A teacher eligible to receive
a license under the compact, upon application, is to undergo a criminal
background check in the receiving state.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As indicated, the compact
establishes the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact Commission to be comprised
of one delegate from each member state, who is to hold the title of
commissioner.  The commissioner is to be the primary administrative officer of
the state licensing authority or a designee.  The commissions powers include
among others: establishing a code of ethics; establishing bylaws; hiring staff;
establishing a budget; borrowing money; promulgating uniform rules to implement
and administer the compact; and determining whether a states adopted language
is materially different from the model compact language to the extent that the
state would not qualify for participation in the compact.  Rules or amendments
are to be adopted or ratified at a regular or special meeting of the
commission.  If a majority of the legislatures of the member states reject a
rule, the rule would have no further force or effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The compact also provides for
the establishment of the Executive Committee of the Interstate Mobility Compact
Commission which has the power to act on behalf of the commission according to
the terms of the compact.  The executive committee is comprised of eight voting
members including the commissions chair, vice-chair, and treasurer, and five
members elected by the commission from the current membership.  The duties of
the executive committee include recommending changes to the rules or bylaws,
changes to the compact legislation, and fees paid by compact member states such
as annual dues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As of this date, compact
legislation has been introduced in 12 states, but has not yet been enacted in
any state.</p>
