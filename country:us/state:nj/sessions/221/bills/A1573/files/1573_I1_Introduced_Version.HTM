(2)   A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in Article X. (3)   Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in paragraph (20) of subsection c. of Article VII to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact. b.    If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member states should be less than 10. c.     Any state that joins the compact after the commissions initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state.  Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state, as the rules and bylaws may be amended as provided in the compact. d.    Any member state may withdraw from the compact by enacting a statute repealing the enabling statute. (1)   A member states withdrawal shall not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing statute. (2)   Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing states licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal. e.     The compact may be amended by the member states.  No amendment to the compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. ARTICLE XII: CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY 12.  The compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The provisions of the compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of the compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any member state or a state seeking membership in the compact, or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If the compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. ARTICLE XIII: CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS 13.  a.  Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact. b.    Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. c.     All permissible agreements between the commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms. 2.    This act shall take effect upon the date the compact is enacted into law in the 10th compact state. STATEMENT The bill enacts in New Jersey the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact.  The terms of the compact make it effective for its signatories upon its adoption by at least 10 states.  The purpose of the compact is to facilitate the mobility of teachers across the member states with the goal of supporting teachers through a new and expedited pathway to licensure. Each compact member state is to define, compile, and update as necessary, a list of eligible licenses that the state is willing to consider for equivalency under the compact and provide the list to the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact Commission, which is established under the bill.  The compact is applicable to the mobility of unencumbered licenses which is defined as a current, valid authorization issued by a member states licensing authority allowing an individual to serve as a teacher in P-12 public education settings.  Under the compact, an unencumbered license is not a restricted, probationary, provisional, substitute or temporary credential.  However, active military members and eligible military spouses may seek to exchange with a member state a restricted, probationary, provisional, substitute, or temporary credential. Upon receipt of an application for licensure by a teacher holding an eligible license, the receiving state is to determine which of the receiving states eligible licenses the teacher is eligible to hold and grant that license to the applicant teacher.  The decision to grant the license is made at the sole discretion of the receiving states licensing authority and may include a determination that the applicant is not eligible for any of the receiving states eligible licenses. In the case of an active military member and eligible military spouse, the receiving state is to grant an equivalent license that, in the receiving districts sole discretion, is equivalent to the license held by the teacher in any other member state, except where the receiving state does not have an equivalent license. In the case of a teacher holding a career and technical education license, the receiving state is to grant a license that, in the receiving states sole discretion, is equivalent to the license held by the applicant teacher and issued by another member state; except where a career and technical education teacher does not hold a bachelors degree and the receiving state requires a bachelors degree for licenses to teach career and technical education.  A receiving state may require career and technical education teachers to meet state industry recognized requirements, if required by law in the receiving state. The compact stipulates that it is not to be construed to limit or inhibit the power of a member state to regulate licensure or endorsements overseen by the member states licensing authority.  Also, nothing in the compact is to be construed to invalidate or alter any existing agreement or other cooperative arrangement to which a member state may already be a party, or limit the ability of a state to participate in any future agreement or cooperative arrangement. A teacher eligible to receive a license under the compact, upon application, is to undergo a criminal background check in the receiving state. As indicated, the compact establishes the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact Commission to be comprised of one delegate from each member state, who is to hold the title of commissioner.  The commissioner is to be the primary administrative officer of the state licensing authority or a designee.  The commissions powers include among others: establishing a code of ethics; establishing bylaws; hiring staff; establishing a budget; borrowing money; promulgating uniform rules to implement and administer the compact; and determining whether a states adopted language is materially different from the model compact language to the extent that the state would not qualify for participation in the compact.  Rules or amendments are to be adopted or ratified at a regular or special meeting of the commission.  If a majority of the legislatures of the member states reject a rule, the rule would have no further force or effect. The compact also provides for the establishment of the Executive Committee of the Interstate Mobility Compact Commission which has the power to act on behalf of the commission according to the terms of the compact.  The executive committee is comprised of eight voting members including the commissions chair, vice-chair, and treasurer, and five members elected by the commission from the current membership.  The duties of the executive committee include recommending changes to the rules or bylaws, changes to the compact legislation, and fees paid by compact member states such as annual dues. As of this date, compact legislation has been introduced in 12 states, but has not yet been enacted in any state.

STATEMENT The bill enacts in New Jersey the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact.  The terms of the compact make it effective for its signatories upon its adoption by at least 10 states.  The purpose of the compact is to facilitate the mobility of teachers across the member states with the goal of supporting teachers through a new and expedited pathway to licensure. Each compact member state is to define, compile, and update as necessary, a list of eligible licenses that the state is willing to consider for equivalency under the compact and provide the list to the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact Commission, which is established under the bill.  The compact is applicable to the mobility of unencumbered licenses which is defined as a current, valid authorization issued by a member states licensing authority allowing an individual to serve as a teacher in P-12 public education settings.  Under the compact, an unencumbered license is not a restricted, probationary, provisional, substitute or temporary credential.  However, active military members and eligible military spouses may seek to exchange with a member state a restricted, probationary, provisional, substitute, or temporary credential. Upon receipt of an application for licensure by a teacher holding an eligible license, the receiving state is to determine which of the receiving states eligible licenses the teacher is eligible to hold and grant that license to the applicant teacher.  The decision to grant the license is made at the sole discretion of the receiving states licensing authority and may include a determination that the applicant is not eligible for any of the receiving states eligible licenses. In the case of an active military member and eligible military spouse, the receiving state is to grant an equivalent license that, in the receiving districts sole discretion, is equivalent to the license held by the teacher in any other member state, except where the receiving state does not have an equivalent license. In the case of a teacher holding a career and technical education license, the receiving state is to grant a license that, in the receiving states sole discretion, is equivalent to the license held by the applicant teacher and issued by another member state; except where a career and technical education teacher does not hold a bachelors degree and the receiving state requires a bachelors degree for licenses to teach career and technical education.  A receiving state may require career and technical education teachers to meet state industry recognized requirements, if required by law in the receiving state. The compact stipulates that it is not to be construed to limit or inhibit the power of a member state to regulate licensure or endorsements overseen by the member states licensing authority.  Also, nothing in the compact is to be construed to invalidate or alter any existing agreement or other cooperative arrangement to which a member state may already be a party, or limit the ability of a state to participate in any future agreement or cooperative arrangement. A teacher eligible to receive a license under the compact, upon application, is to undergo a criminal background check in the receiving state. As indicated, the compact establishes the Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact Commission to be comprised of one delegate from each member state, who is to hold the title of commissioner.  The commissioner is to be the primary administrative officer of the state licensing authority or a designee.  The commissions powers include among others: establishing a code of ethics; establishing bylaws; hiring staff; establishing a budget; borrowing money; promulgating uniform rules to implement and administer the compact; and determining whether a states adopted language is materially different from the model compact language to the extent that the state would not qualify for participation in the compact.  Rules or amendments are to be adopted or ratified at a regular or special meeting of the commission.  If a majority of the legislatures of the member states reject a rule, the rule would have no further force or effect. The compact also provides for the establishment of the Executive Committee of the Interstate Mobility Compact Commission which has the power to act on behalf of the commission according to the terms of the compact.  The executive committee is comprised of eight voting members including the commissions chair, vice-chair, and treasurer, and five members elected by the commission from the current membership.  The duties of the executive committee include recommending changes to the rules or bylaws, changes to the compact legislation, and fees paid by compact member states such as annual dues. As of this date, compact legislation has been introduced in 12 states, but has not yet been enacted in any state.
