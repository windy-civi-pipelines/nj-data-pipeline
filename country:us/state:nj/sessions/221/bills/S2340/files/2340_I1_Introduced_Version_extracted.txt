Specifically, the bill authorizes treatment programs to acquire housing units and concurrently provide both treatment services and housing, as well as transportation between treatment and housing, to individuals in need of both substance use disorder treatment and housing.  The bill requires that the housing be provided under a separate contract from the treatment services, and that the housing contract expressly state that the individual acknowledges a good faith responsibility to repay any discounts or subsidies provided in connection with the housing.  Additionally, the individual receiving the housing is to be advised that the receipt of housing and treatment services are not contingent on each other, and that each service may be received separately and independently.  Any housing offered by a treatment program is to be operated in compliance with State and local laws relating to zoning and safety. The bill specifies that treatment programs are otherwise prohibited from providing or receiving any form of remuneration or anything of value for the referral of a person who is seeking treatment for a substance use disorder.  Doing so is currently a crime of the fourth degree, which is punishable by imprisonment for up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  The bill further specifies that nothing in its provisions is to be construed to prohibit a person, program, or entity from providing an individual with educational or informational materials about community resources, including, but not limited to, housing assistance.
