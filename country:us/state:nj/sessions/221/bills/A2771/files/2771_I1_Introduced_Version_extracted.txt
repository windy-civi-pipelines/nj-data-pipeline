This bill is in response to the State Supreme Court case of Kocanowski v. Twp. of Bridgewater, 237 N.J. 3, 14 (2019), in which the Court held that the Legislature intended for all volunteer firefighters [to receive] the maximum compensation allowed, regardless of current or previous income.  The bill is intended to clarify any ambiguity in the existing law as to the workers compensation entitlement of certain volunteer firefighters and other workers.
