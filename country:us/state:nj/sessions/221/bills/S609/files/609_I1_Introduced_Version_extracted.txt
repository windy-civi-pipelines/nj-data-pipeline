The classification of productive farmland as an area in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation under the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law is detrimental to the States agricultural economy.  Retaining productive farmland is critically important to New Jersey, nicknamed The Garden State, as agriculture is one of the States largest industries.
