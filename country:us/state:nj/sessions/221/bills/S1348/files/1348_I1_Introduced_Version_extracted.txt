Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation to the contrary, for the purposes of R.S.33:1-12, all sales of cigars and food at a cigar bar that is subject to the provisions of this subsection shall be deemed an accommodation to patrons of the cigar bar, and all nonalcoholic beverages sold to patrons of the cigar bar shall be deemed as accessory beverages to alcoholic beverages. (cf: P.L.2018, c.58, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would establish a new exemption from the requirements of the New Jersey Smoke-Free Air Act to allow additional cigar bars to open in the Atlantic City Tourism District.  The bill would require that any cigar bar established under its provisions be registered with the local board of health and approved as a permitted use by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.  Smoking in the new cigar bars would be limited to cigars, and the new bars would not be located on the premises of a casino.  A cigar bar authorized under the bill will be required to have a license or permit authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises, and to restrict entry to only persons 21 years of age and older.  For the purposes of complying with State laws concerning retail liquor licenses, all sales of cigars and food at the cigar bar will be deemed to be an accommodation to patrons, and all nonalcoholic beverage sales will be deemed as accessory to alcoholic beverages. It is the sponsors belief that allowing new cigar bars and lounges to open will help promote tourism, enhance the Atlantic City experience, allow vacant properties to be redeveloped into thriving businesses, and stimulate additional commercial development in the Atlantic City Tourism District.
