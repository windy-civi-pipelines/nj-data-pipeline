<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the facility has
established protocols and procedures and implemented security measures to
ensure that any medical cannabis obtained by an institutional caregiver that is
transported by the caregiver to the facility is transported in a safe and
secure manner that prevents theft, diversion, adulteration, and access by
unauthorized individuals, and that any medical cannabis present at the facility
is stored in a safe and secure manner that prevents theft, diversion,
adulteration, and access by unauthorized individuals;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the facility has
established protocols and procedures to review the medications and treatment
plans of registered qualifying patients at the facility to ensure that the
patient's medical use of cannabis will not result in adverse drug interactions,
side effects, or other complications that could significantly jeopardize the
health or safety of the patient;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   the facility will not
charge a registered qualifying patient for medical cannabis obtained on the

cost of the medical cannabis, plus any reasonable costs incurred in acquiring
the medical cannabis; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   the facility has
established protocols and procedures concerning whether, and to what extent,
designated caregivers are permitted to assist registered qualifying patients
with the medical use of cannabis while at the facility; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   the facility will
promptly notify the commission in the event that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   an institutional
caregiver registered with the commission pursuant to this section ceases to be
employed by the facility or ceases to be authorized by the facility to assist
registered qualifying patients with the medical use of cannabis, in which case,
upon receipt of the notification, the commission shall immediately revoke the
institutional caregiver's registration; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   an institutional
caregiver registered with the commission pursuant to this section, who
completed a criminal history record background check as a condition of

this State after the date the criminal history background check was performed,
in which case, upon receipt of that notification, the commission shall make a
determination regarding the continued eligibility of the applicant to serve as
an institutional caregiver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing in this section shall

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  a.  A
registered qualifying patient who is 21 years of age or older, or a designated
caregiver for the patient, shall be authorized to cultivate and possess up to
four mature cannabis plants and up to four immature cannabis plants for the
patients personal medical use upon providing notice to the commission as
provided in subsection b. of this section.  Any medical cannabis that is home
cultivated pursuant to this section shall be cultivated in the residence of the
patient or the patients designated caregiver, as applicable, at the address
indicated in the individuals current registry information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  A registered
qualifying patient who seeks to home cultivate medical cannabis, either
directly or using a designated caregiver, shall, prior to commencing the home
cultivation of medical cannabis, provide notice to the commission of the
patients intent to home cultivate medical cannabis.  The notice provided to
the commission shall specify the individual who will be authorized to home
cultivate medical cannabis for the patient.  In no case may more than one
individual home cultivate medical cannabis for a registered qualifying patient
at one time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Upon providing at least
10 days notice to the commission, a registered qualifying patient shall be
authorized to change which individual will be authorized to home cultivate
medical cannabis for the patient.  No less than 10 days and no more than 30
days after providing notice of a change in authorization to home cultivate
medical cannabis, the individual formerly cultivating medical cannabis for the
patient may transfer any mature and immature medical cannabis plants in that
individuals possession to the individual to whom authorization was
transferred.  Any medical cannabis plants that are not transferred to the subsequent
home cultivator by the former home cultivator shall be promptly surrendered by
the former home cultivator to law enforcement for destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Upon receiving notice
of a change in a registered qualifying patients intent to home cultivate medical
cannabis or of a change in who is authorized to home cultivate medical cannabis
for a registered qualifying patient, the commission shall promptly update the
registration information for the patient and for any of the patients
designated caregivers who are affected by the change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection b. of this section to the contrary, any designated
caregiver of a registered qualifying patient who elects to home cultivate
medical cannabis shall be authorized to possess, transport, and assist the
patient with the administration of home-cultivated medical cannabis in dried
form or in any other consumable form, regardless of whether the designated
caregiver is the individual who is specifically authorized to home cultivate
medical cannabis for the patient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In addition to any
other civil or criminal penalties as may apply, any individual in possession of
home-cultivated medical cannabis in the form of a mature or immature plant or
in any consumable form, who sells, donates, or furnishes the home-cultivated
medical cannabis to any individual who is not authorized to be in possession of
the home-cultivated medical cannabis as provided in this section, shall be
liable to a civil penalty of up to $1,000, which shall be collected by and in
the name of the commission in summary proceedings before a court of competent
jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of the Penalty Enforcement Law of
1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  In addition, the individuals
registration with the commission shall be deemed null and void, and the
individual shall be permanently ineligible for re-registration with the
commission as a qualifying patient, a designated caregiver, or an institutional
caregiver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill authorizes the home
cultivation of medical cannabis for a registered qualifying patients personal
medical use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
provides that a registered qualifying patient who is 21 years of age or older
who provides notice to the Cannabis Regulatory Commission of the intent to home
cultivate medical cannabis will be allowed to either home cultivate medical
cannabis himself or herself, or authorize a designated caregiver to home
cultivate medical cannabis on the patients behalf.  A home cultivator will be
allowed to cultivate and possess up to four mature cannabis plants and up to
four immature cannabis plants.  Medical cannabis may only be home cultivated at
the residence of the authorized home cultivator that is on file with the
commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The notice of intent to home
cultivate medical cannabis provided to the commission is to specify which
individual will home cultivate the medical cannabis.  In no case may more than
one individual home cultivate medical cannabis for a registered qualifying
patient at one time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A patient may change the
designated home cultivator upon providing 10 days notice to the commission. 
At least 10 days after providing the notice of change, but no more than 30 days
after providing notice, any medical cannabis plants in the former home
cultivators possession may be transferred to the new designated home
cultivator.  Any plants that are not transferred to the new home cultivator are
to be promptly surrendered to law enforcement for destruction.  The failure to
provide notice of a change in designated home cultivator will result in the
patients registration with the commission being deemed null and void.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission will be
required to promptly update the registry information for the patient and any
affected designated caregiver upon receiving notice of the patients intent to
home cultivate medical cannabis or of a change in who is authorized to home
cultivate medical cannabis for the patient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any designated caregiver of a
patient who elects to home cultivate medical cannabis will be authorized to
possess, transport, and assist the patient with the administration of home-cultivated
medical cannabis in dried form or in any other consumable form, regardless of
whether the designated caregiver is designated as the patients home
cultivator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to any other civil
or criminal penalties as may apply, any individual in possession of
home-cultivated medical cannabis in the form of a mature or immature plant or
in any consumable form, who sells, donates, or furnishes the home-cultivated
medical cannabis to any individual who is not authorized to be in possession of
the home-cultivated medical cannabis under the bill, will be liable to a civil
penalty of up to $1,000.  In addition, the individuals registration with the
commission will be deemed null and void, and the individual will be permanently
ineligible for re-registration with the commission as a qualifying patient, a
designated caregiver, or an institutional caregiver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent to
expand access to medical cannabis for registered qualifying patients who may
find the medical cannabis that is available through a medical cannabis
dispensary unaffordable, or who may otherwise benefit from the convenience of
home cultivation or the ability to readily access medical cannabis in the
strain and form appropriate to the patients individual treatment needs.  Of the
36 states that have approved a comprehensive medical cannabis program, 17, or
nearly half, currently allow for home cultivation of medical cannabis:  Alaska,
Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont,
and Washington.</p>
