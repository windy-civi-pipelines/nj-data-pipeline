If any person to whom such a subpoena is issued fails to appear or, having appeared, refuses to give testimony, or fails to produce the books, papers, or other documents required, the inspector general may apply to the Superior Court and the court may order the person to appear and give testimony or produce the books, papers, or other documents as applicable.  Any person failing to obey the courts order may be punished by the court for contempt. d.    A person compelled to appear by the inspector general and provide sworn testimony shall have the right to be accompanied by counsel, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of the witness rights.  A witness compelled to appear and testify shall be accorded all due process rights. e.     A prosecutor or member of the prosecution team under investigation for misconduct by the inspector general is prohibited from using privilege or work-product protection to withhold information from the inspector general if the prosecution related to that information has concluded. 3.    a.  The Inspector General for Prosecutorial Review shall establish the internal organizational structure of the office in a manner appropriate to carrying out the duties and responsibilities of the office.  The inspector general shall have the power to appoint, employ, promote, and remove assistants, employees, and personnel as deemed necessary for the efficient and effective administration of the office. b.    Within the limits of funds appropriated for such purposes, the inspector general may obtain the services of qualified management consultants or other professionals necessary to independently perform the duties and responsibilities of the office.  Consultants shall be selected through an open competitive process and the inspector general shall establish standards and protocols to ensure the fairness and integrity of the process. 4.    The Inspector General for Prosecutorial Review is authorized to call upon any department, office, division, or agency of State government to provide information, resources, or other assistance deemed necessary to discharge the duties and responsibilities of the inspector general.  Each department, office, division, and agency of this State shall cooperate with the inspector general and furnish the office with any necessary assistance. 5.    The Inspector General for Prosecutorial Review is authorized to cooperate and conduct joint investigations with other State oversight entities, including the State Auditor, the State Commission of Investigation, the State Comptroller, and the State Inspector General.  The inspector general is authorized and shall be permitted to participate in investigations conducted by other State oversight entities. 6.    a.  The Inspector General for Prosecutorial Review may decline to investigate a complaint received when it is determined that: (1)   the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious, or not made in good faith; (2)   if, in the opinion of the inspector general, the complaint has been delayed too long to produce sufficient evidence or witnesses to justify a present investigation; (3)   the resources available, in considering established priorities, are insufficient for an adequate investigation; or (4)   the matter complained of is not within the inspector generals investigatory authority. b.    The inspector general is authorized to refer a complaint received that alleges possible criminal conduct and any independent investigation initiated by the inspector general that alleges possible criminal conduct to an appropriate prosecutorial authority.  Whenever a criminal referral is made against a prosecutor, the inspector general shall be responsible for notifying the Office of Attorney Ethics.  Whenever a criminal referral is made against a detective who is part of a prosecution team, the inspector general shall be responsible for ensuring the referral is documented as part of the detectives personnel file.

The IG will operate independently, without supervision or control by any other State officer or employee. Under the bill, the IG's primary role is to investigate allegations concerning the misconduct of a prosecutor or any member of a prosecution team, including detectives. To this end, the IG is to provide a confidential process for submitting complaints by both the public and government employees. The IG is responsible for organizing the office, hiring staff, and engaging consultants as needed, using a fair, competitive process to ensure independence and effectiveness.
