(cf: P.L.2020, c.76 , s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect on January 1 next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill designates Vaisakhi and Bandi Chhor Divas as public holidays in this State. Sikhism is represented by the central principles of truthful living, service to humanity, and devotion to God.  Founded by Guru Nanak in the Punjab region of India during the 15th century, the Sikh spiritual tradition is rooted in the belief that every person, regardless of race, gender, sex, or creed, is equal before God.  Sikhism is the worlds fifth-largest religion with nearly 30 million adherents.  Approximately one million Sikhs call the United States home, some of whom have families that began immigrating to the United States over 100 years ago.  Sikh spiritual tradition and the founding principles of the United States contain significant similarities, such as the belief of the equality of persons before God and a commitment to public service to ones neighbor and nation. Vaisakhi is a Sikh day of gathering and celebration that originated more than 300 years ago.  It is a harvest festival that marks the day in which the tenth in a line of gurus, or spiritual leaders, unified Sikhs and formalized many aspects of the faith. Vaisakhi typically falls on April 13 or April 14 of each year and marks the first day of the month Vaisakh in the Sikh calendar.  It was on Vaisakhi that the mandatory outward identity was established, ensuring that Sikhs may stand out and be called upon for help.  Vaisakhi is often celebrated by Sikhs attending their local gurdwara to worship, meditate, and to participate in langar, which is a free community meal prepared and served by volunteers at gurdwaras. Bandi Chhor Divas, meaning liberation of prisoners day, is a Sikh day of gathering and celebration which commemorates Guru Hargobind Sahibs release from Gwalior Fort prison in the 17th century.  The sixth guru refused to be released unless other innocent princes were also freed and returned to the holy city of Amritsar.  Emperor Jahangir, his captor, said that those who clung to the guru's coat would be able to go free.  This was meant to limit the number of prisoners who could be released.  In response, Guru Hargobind had a coat made with 52 tassels attached to it so that all of the princes could leave prison with him.  This story reminds Sikhs of freedom and human rights, and on Bandi Chhor Divas, these principles are celebrated.  This day, which typically falls in the autumn, is celebrated by the lighting of homes and gurdwaras, a celebratory street procession called nagar kirtan, langar, and fireworks displays.  Gifts, especially dried fruits and sweets, are often exchanged during this day.
