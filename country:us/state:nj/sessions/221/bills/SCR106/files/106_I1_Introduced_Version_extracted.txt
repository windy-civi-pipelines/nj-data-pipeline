INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This proposed constitutional amendment would provide a property tax exemption for a primary residence of the surviving spouse of a first responder who dies in the line of duty.

The property must be owned and occupied by the surviving spouse.  The property must also have been the primary residence of the first responder at the time of the first responders death. A surviving spouse who remarries would no longer receive the exemption. The State would reimburse each taxing district for the amount of property taxes that would have otherwise been due for each property receiving the exemption each year. STATEMENT If approved by the voters, this proposed constitutional amendment would provide a property tax exemption for the primary residence owned and occupied by the surviving spouse of a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or first aid, ambulance, or rescue squad member who dies in the line of duty.  The exemption would include the surviving spouses of both paid and volunteer firefighters and first aid, ambulance, or rescue squad members. The property receiving the exemption is also required to have been the primary residence of the first responder at the time the first responders death. A surviving spouse would qualify for the exemption, and continue to receive it, for as long as the spouse owns and occupies the home as a primary residence and does not remarry. The constitutional amendment would also require the State to annually reimburse each taxing district for the amount of property taxes that would have otherwise been due for each property receiving the exemption established under the bill had the property been taxed the same as other land within the taxing district.
