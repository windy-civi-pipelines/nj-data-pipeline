designation as a New Jersey film studio partner and becomes designated as a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, the authority shall reduce the cumulative total amount of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, made available to New Jersey studio partners in each fiscal year and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey film-lease production companies in each fiscal year by a corresponding amount pursuant to a formula established in rules adopted by the authority which shall

each New Jersey studio partner to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period.  If a New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period or otherwise fails to satisfy the conditions for designation as a New Jersey studio partner, the authority shall recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayer's designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for which the authority has not approved final documentation, shall terminate.  The authority shall establish a non-binding, administrative pre-certification process for potentially eligible projects. If the cumulative total amount of tax credits, and tax credit transfer certificates, allowed to taxpayers for privilege periods or taxable years commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection a. of this section and subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b) exceeds the amount of tax credits available in that fiscal year, then taxpayers who have first applied for and have not been allowed a tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate amount for that reason shall have their applications approved by the authority, provided the application otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section, and shall be allowed the amount of tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate on the first day of the next succeeding fiscal year in which tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates under subsection a. of this section and subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b) are not in excess of the amount of credits available. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved to New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved to each such category, in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval to each such category in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining for each such category from the prior fiscal year. The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved for each such category, but not subject to redemption or transfer.

(2)  The authority may in any given year determine that it is in the State's interest to approve an amount of tax credits in excess of the annual limitations set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, but in no event more than $200,000,000 in excess of the annual limitation, upon a determination by the authority board that such increase is warranted based on specific criteria that may include: (i) the increased demand for opportunities to create or retain employment and investment in the State as indicated by the volume of project applications and the amount of tax credits being sought by those applications; (ii) the need to protect the State's economic position in the event of an economic downturn; (iii) the quality of project applications and the net economic benefit to the State and municipalities associated with those applications; (iv) opportunities for project applications to strengthen or protect the competitiveness of the State under the prevailing market conditions; (v) enhanced access to employment and investment for underserved populations in distressed municipalities and qualified incentives tracts; (vi) increased investment and employment in high-growth technology sectors and in projects that entail collaboration with education institutions in the State; (vii) increased development proximate to mass transit facilities; (viii) any other factor deemed relevant by the authority. c.   In the event that the authority in any year approves projects for tax credits in an amount less than the annual limitations set forth in paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, then the uncommitted portion of the annual limitation shall be available to be deployed by the authority in future years for projects under the same program; provided however, that in no event shall the aggregate amount of tax credits approved be in excess of the overall cap of $11.5 billion, and in no event shall the uncommitted portion of the annual limitation for any previous year be deployed after the conclusion of the nine-year period. d.   Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, the uncommitted balance of the total value of tax credits authorized for award by the authority pursuant to subparagraph (f) of paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section to the "New Jersey Aspire Program Act," sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 et seq.), and the "Emerge Program Act," sections 68 through 81 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-336 et al.), shall be made available for tax credits allowed to New Jersey studio partners [and], New Jersey film-lease production companies, and taxpayers, other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to sections 1 and 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b and C.54A:4-12b).  The value of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, made available to New Jersey studio partners [and], New Jersey film-lease production companies, and taxpayers, other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to this subsection shall be as follows: (1) in fiscal year 2023, $250,000,000 for New Jersey studio partners and $250,000,000 for New Jersey film-lease production companies; (2) in fiscal year 2024, $250,000,000 for New Jersey studio partners and $250,000,000 for New Jersey film-lease production companies; and (3) in fiscal year 2025, $250,000,000 for New Jersey studio partners [and], $250,000,000 for New Jersey film-lease production companies, and $300,000,000 for taxpayers, other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies. If the value of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, approved to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in any fiscal year pursuant to this subsection is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval to each such category in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining for each such category from the prior fiscal year.

companies shall be subject to award agreements with the authority detailing obligations of the awardee and outcomes relating to events of default, including, but not limited to, recapture, forfeiture, and termination.  Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection or other law to the contrary, if a film production company designated as a New Jersey studio partner ceases to qualify for its designation as a New Jersey film studio partner and becomes designated as a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, the authority shall reduce the cumulative total amount of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, made available to New Jersey studio partners in each fiscal year and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits

period.  If a New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period or otherwise fails to satisfy the conditions for designation as a New Jersey studio partner, the authority shall recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to

Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved to New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved to each such category, in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval to each such category in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining for each such category from the prior fiscal year.
