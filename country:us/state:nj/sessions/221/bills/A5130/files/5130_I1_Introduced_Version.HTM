c.217 (C.52:27D-132) is amended to read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     14.  a.  The enforcing agency
shall periodically inspect all construction undertaken pursuant to a
construction permit issued by it to ensure that the construction or alteration
is performed in accordance with the conditions of the construction permit and
consistent with the requirements of the code and any ordinance implementing
said code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The owner of any
premises upon which a building or structure is being constructed shall be
deemed to have consented to the inspection by the enforcing agency and the
department, of the entire premises and of any and all construction being
performed on it until a certificate of occupancy has been issued.  An
inspector, or team of inspectors, on presentation of proper credentials, shall
have the right to enter and inspect such premises, and any and all construction
thereon, for purposes of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the
applicable construction permit, the code, and other applicable laws and
regulations.  All <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>inspection<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>inspections</u>
pursuant to P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.) shall be between the hours
of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on business days or at another time that has been agreed
upon by the owner and the relevant inspecting entity, whether the enforcing
agency, department, or private on-site inspection agency, or when construction
is actually being undertaken, provided, however, that inspections may be
conducted at other times if the enforcing agency has reasonable cause to believe
that an immediate danger to life, limb or property exists, or if permission is
given by an owner, or the owner's agent, architect, engineer or builder.  No
person shall accompany an inspector or team of inspectors on any inspection
pursuant to P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), unless the person's
presence is necessary for the enforcement of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et
seq.), or the code, or unless consent is given by an owner or the owner's
agent, architect, engineer or builder.</p>

structure or building is being undertaken contrary to the provisions of a
construction permit, P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), the code, or other
applicable laws or ordinances, the enforcing agency may issue a stop construction
order in writing which shall state the conditions upon which construction may
be resumed and which shall be given to the owner or the holder of the

or allow to be continued, the construction of a building or structure in
violation of a stop construction order, except with the permission of the
enforcing agency to abate a dangerous condition or remove a violation, or
except by court order.  If an order to stop construction is not obeyed, the
enforcing agency may apply to the appropriate court as otherwise established by
law for an order enjoining the violation of the stop construction order.  The
remedy for violation of such an order provided in this subsection shall be in

terminate the violation, the enforcing agency shall require the same inspector
or team of inspectors who found the violation to undertake any subsequent
reinspection thereof at the premises.  When the same inspector or team of
inspectors cannot be assigned to undertake the reinspection, the enforcing
agency may assign an available inspector<u>,</u> provided the scope of the
reinspection shall be limited to the violation for which the reinspection is
required.  The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to violations of
the plumbing or electrical subcodes, or to fire safety code violations, or to
any violation of any other subcode that the Department of Community Affairs
determines to be a health or safety violation.  Nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to infringe upon the right of a property owner to request a

agency shall perform an inspection for any owner, agent, or other responsible
person in charge of work, if an owner, agent, or other responsible person is
currently employed by or affiliated with any individual affiliated with the
private on-site inspection agency or has employed or was associated with an
individual affiliated with the private on-site inspection agency within a
timeframe established by the commissioner by regulation.</p>

already paid less administrative costs for the enforcing agency and shall not
