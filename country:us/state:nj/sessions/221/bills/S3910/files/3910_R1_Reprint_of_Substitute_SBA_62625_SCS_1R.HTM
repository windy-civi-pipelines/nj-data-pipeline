<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  Research is clear that
high-quality preschool can change the educational trajectories of young
children, particularly economically disadvantaged children and multilingual
learners. Improvements in literacy, numeracy, social-emotional and
self-regulatory development, and lifetime earnings have been demonstrated among
individuals who attend high-quality preschool compared to their peers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.   New Jersey leads the
nation in expanding access to high-quality preschool opportunities. The State
has achieved a unique and world-class combination of significant financial
investment and rigorous quality standards. New Jersey State-funded preschools
are required to serve three- and four-year olds in full-day programs featuring
small class sizes led by quality instructors with ample curriculum support,
professional development, and accommodations for students with special needs. New
Jerseys State spending on preschool is among the highest in the country, with
clear, significant impacts on our public school system: tens of thousands of
three- and four-year olds in hundreds of communities around the State attend
transformative high-quality early education programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  District-operated
preschool programs, licensed childcare centers, and Head Start programs form an
interrelated and interdependent early childhood ecosystem. Each component is
made stronger by the other, and the system is greater and more impactful than
the sum of its parts. No component can reach its full potential without the
facilities, staff, resources, and expertise of the others. Together, the system
represents a continuum of education and care services from birth through age
five necessary not only for children to realize their full life potential, but
for families to participate fully in economic and civic society. To lift up
this system is a moral and economic imperative.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  To build on the States
preschool expansion progress to date and to realize the full benefits of
high-quality preschool, it is fitting and proper for the State to enshrine
certain policies and values in State law, including: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  providing sustainable,
annual financial support for expanding access to high-quality preschool;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  codifying preschool
education aid provisions previously implemented through language in various annual
appropriations acts and harmonizing New Jersey law accordingly;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      (3)  prioritizing expansion
for economically disadvantaged families and communities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      (4)  requiring State-funded
preschool programs to make every effort to partner with local ready, willing,
and able licensed childcare providers and Head Start programs; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  conducting ongoing
evaluations of the States approach to early childhood and preschool education
to ensure that policy continues to reflect stakeholder expertise and evolving
research.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  In addition to
high-quality preschool education, full-day kindergarten is necessary not only
to unlock a childs full learning potential, but to facilitate a smooth
transition from high-quality preschool into elementary programs.</p>
