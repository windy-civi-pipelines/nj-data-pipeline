<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.  The Department of

providers, Head Start program providers, and other stakeholders identified by

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill defines preschool
expansion aid, establishes eligibility criteria for the aid, and creates
requirements for recipients of preschool expansion aid. Additionally, the bill
makes changes to the calculation of preschool education aid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, school
districts are required to provide certain thresholds of free preschool
education opportunities based on the districts district factor group (DFG) and
concentration of at-risk students. DFGs are determined using multiple
indicators of socioeconomic status, including attainment rates for high school
diplomas and college education, occupational status, unemployment rate, poverty
rate, and median family income.  DFGs have not been updated since 2004.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill removes the
distinction between DFGs for both the determination of preschool education aid
and the thresholds of free preschool education opportunities that are required
under current law.  Under the bill, all districts would be required to provide
free preschool education opportunities for all three- and four-year old pupils
in the district, to the extent possible based on the amount of preschool
education aid provided to the district, by a date determined by each school
district.  The Commissioner of Education may require a school district to
resubmit the districts plan for the provision of free access to full-day
preschool at any time following the initial submission.  The bill allows any
district that operates a preschool program to apply to the commissioner for
approval to establish tuition based on a familys ability to pay if the
district is able to demonstrate that the districts finances would not support
a free full-day preschool program and that establishing tuition would allow the
district to enroll substantially more at-risk students.  Under the bill,
preschool expansion aid would be provided to a district in any year in which
free preschool opportunities are not provided to all three- and four- year olds
in the district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that each school
district is required to submit a plan to the Commissioner of Education by July
1, 2025 to reach free access to full-day preschool for all three- and four-year
old pupils by a date determined by the district.  A school district that does
not offer full-day kindergarten is to include in its submission a plan for the
provision of full-day kindergarten.  Subsequently, the commissioner is required
to prepare and make public a Statewide strategic plan to achieve full
implementation of full-day preschool education.  The plan is to be based on the
plans submitted by each school district and is required to be posted on the
departments Internet website and submitted to the Governor, and to the Legislature
no later than July 1, 2026.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Preschool expansion aid is
defined under the bill as any portion of Preschool Education Aid allocated by
the Commissioner of Education for the purpose of expanding free access to
preschool for resident three- and four-year old children, or any other State funds
appropriated for the same purpose.  To be eligible to receive preschool
expansion aid, a district is required to offer full-day kindergarten, however,
the commissioner may waive this requirement if there is sufficient funding.  In
determining preschool expansion aid award amounts and recipients, the
commissioner is to give preference to districts in accordance with the
concentration of at-risk students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Recipients of preschool
expansion aid would be required to implement a mixed delivery method, whereby a
mix of district programs, licensed child care provider programs, and Head Start
Programs are utilized in the delivery of preschool education.  In establishing
a mixed delivery method, a school district is to partner with any licensed
child care provider that is able to demonstrate an ability to meet the Elements
of High Quality Preschool Programs promulgated by the Department of Education
and all applicable Preschool Program Implementation Guidelines. The district is
required to ensure that free preschool opportunities are first provided to
at-risk students.  In addition, a school district is required under the bill to
provide payments to a partnering licensed child care provider that are only based
on the contracted number of seats agreed upon by the school district and the
licensed child care provider, provided that average provider enrollment exceeds
95 percent of contracted slots and providers are permitted to enroll children
directly via a centralized system shared with the district in which the licensed
child care provider is operating.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires the
Department of Education, the Department of Children and Families, and the
Department of Human Services, in consultation with school districts, licensed
child care providers, Head Start program providers, and other stakeholders, to
submit a report to the Legislature regarding the status of preschool education
in the State and the efficacy of the mixed delivery method of preschool
education.</p>
