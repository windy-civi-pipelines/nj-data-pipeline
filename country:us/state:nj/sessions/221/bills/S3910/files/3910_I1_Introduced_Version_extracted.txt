Beginning in the 2009-2010 school year, the school district shall receive preschool education aid calculated in accordance with the provisions of subsection a. of this section based upon projected preschool enrollment. In the 2009-2010 school year the school district may also receive start-up funds in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner. (4)   In the case of a school district that received preschool expansion aid or education opportunity aid in the 2007-2008 school year, for the 2008-2009 school year the district shall receive preschool education aid in an amount equal to the preschool budget approved by the commissioner for the 2008-2009 school year.  Preschool education aid for the 2008-2009 school year shall be adjusted following receipt of the Application for State School Aid in October 2008.  Beginning in the 2009-2010 school year, the school district shall receive preschool education aid calculated in accordance with the provisions of subsection a. of this section based upon projected preschool enrollment; except that for any school year the district shall not receive preschool aid in an amount less than either the total amount of preschool aid the district received in the 2008-2009 school year after the State aid adjustment or the district's 2008-2009 school year preschool per pupil aid amount multiplied by the projected number of preschool pupils after the State aid adjustment, whichever is greater. In the 2009-2010 school year the school district may also receive start-up funds in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner. (5)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection to the contrary, beginning with the first full school year next following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and for a period of five school years, a school district that receives an allocation of preschool education aid based on the amount of Early Launch to Learning Initiative aid received in a previous school year or the amount of Early Childhood Program Aid received in a previous school year shall have the proportion of its preschool education aid based on the amount of Early Launch to Learning Initiative aid previously received or the amount of Early Childhood Program Aid previously received reduced in each year and the proportion of its preschool education aid calculated pursuant to subsection a. of this section increased in each year.  This transition shall be done in a manner determined by the Commissioner of Education, except that the commissioner shall ensure that at the end of five full school years following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), all school districts receive allocations of preschool education aid calculated pursuant to subsection a. of this section, and no school district receives an allocation of preschool education aid based on the amount of Early Launch to Learning Initiative aid received in a previous school year or the amount of Early Childhood Program Aid received in a previous school year. d.    For the 2008-2009 school year, the preschool per pupil aid amounts shall be $11,506 for pupils enrolled in an in-district program, $12,934 for pupils enrolled in a licensed child care provider program, and $7,146 for pupils enrolled in a Head Start Program.  The preschool per pupil aid amounts shall be adjusted by the CPI in the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years as required pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of this act.  For subsequent school years, the preschool per pupil aid amounts shall be established in the Educational Adequacy Report, with the amounts adjusted by the CPI for each of the two school years following the first school year to which the report is applicable. e.     A district shall appropriate preschool education aid in a special revenue fund for expenditure.

(cf: P.L.2007, c.260, s.12) 3.  (New section) a. A school district shall be eligible to apply for and receive preschool expansion aid if the district provides full-day kindergarten at the time of application and meets any other criteria the Commissioner of Education deems appropriate. The commissioner may waive the requirement for a district to offer full-day kindergarten if there is sufficient funding to offer additional preschool expansion aid awards. b. In determining preschool expansion aid award amounts and recipients, the commissioner shall give preference to districts in accordance with the concentration of at-risk pupils, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-45). c. The Department of Education, the Department of Children and Families, and the Department of Human Services shall maintain on the departments Internet websites a page that includes; (1) a list of all districts receiving preschool education aid for the school year; (2) a list of all districts eligible to apply for preschool expansion aid for the school year; (3) a list of all licensed child care providers and Head Start programs in each districts community, as well as in neighboring communities; and (4) the contact information for all district-operated preschool programs, licensed child care providers, and Head Start programs.

The Department of Education may utilize up to $250,000 of any appropriation for preschool education aid to contract temporary staff to assist with the preparation of the report issued pursuant to this section. 6.   This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill defines preschool expansion aid, establishes eligibility criteria for the aid, and creates requirements for recipients of preschool expansion aid. Additionally, the bill makes changes to the calculation of preschool education aid. Under current law, school districts are required to provide certain thresholds of free preschool education opportunities based on the districts district factor group (DFG) and concentration of at-risk students. DFGs are determined using multiple indicators of socioeconomic status, including attainment rates for high school diplomas and college education, occupational status, unemployment rate, poverty rate, and median family income.  DFGs have not been updated since 2004. This bill removes the distinction between DFGs for both the determination of preschool education aid and the thresholds of free preschool education opportunities that are required under current law.  Under the bill, all districts would be required to provide free preschool education opportunities for all three- and four-year old pupils in the district, to the extent possible based on the amount of preschool education aid provided to the district, by a date determined by each school district.  The Commissioner of Education may require a school district to resubmit the districts plan for the provision of free access to full-day preschool at any time following the initial submission.  The bill allows any district that operates a preschool program to apply to the commissioner for approval to establish tuition based on a familys ability to pay if the district is able to demonstrate that the districts finances would not support a free full-day preschool program and that establishing tuition would allow the district to enroll substantially more at-risk students.  Under the bill, preschool expansion aid would be provided to a district in any year in which free preschool opportunities are not provided to all three- and four- year olds in the district. The bill provides that each school district is required to submit a plan to the Commissioner of Education by July 1, 2025 to reach free access to full-day preschool for all three- and four-year old pupils by a date determined by the district.  A school district that does not offer full-day kindergarten is to include in its submission a plan for the provision of full-day kindergarten.  Subsequently, the commissioner is required to prepare and make public a Statewide strategic plan to achieve full implementation of full-day preschool education.  The plan is to be based on the plans submitted by each school district and is required to be posted on the departments Internet website and submitted to the Governor, and to the Legislature no later than July 1, 2026. Preschool expansion aid is defined under the bill as any portion of Preschool Education Aid allocated by the Commissioner of Education for the purpose of expanding free access to preschool for resident three- and four-year old children, or any other State funds appropriated for the same purpose.  To be eligible to receive preschool expansion aid, a district is required to offer full-day kindergarten, however, the commissioner may waive this requirement if there is sufficient funding.  In determining preschool expansion aid award amounts and recipients, the commissioner is to give preference to districts in accordance with the concentration of at-risk students. Recipients of preschool expansion aid would be required to implement a mixed delivery method, whereby a mix of district programs, licensed child care provider programs, and Head Start Programs are utilized in the delivery of preschool education.  In establishing a mixed delivery method, a school district is to partner with any licensed child care provider that is able to demonstrate an ability to meet the Elements of High Quality Preschool Programs promulgated by the Department of Education and all applicable Preschool Program Implementation Guidelines. The district is required to ensure that free preschool opportunities are first provided to at-risk students.  In addition, a school district is required under the bill to provide payments to a partnering licensed child care provider that are only based on the contracted number of seats agreed upon by the school district and the licensed child care provider, provided that average provider enrollment exceeds 95 percent of contracted slots and providers are permitted to enroll children directly via a centralized system shared with the district in which the licensed child care provider is operating. Finally, the bill requires the Department of Education, the Department of Children and Families, and the Department of Human Services, in consultation with school districts, licensed child care providers, Head Start program providers, and other stakeholders, to submit a report to the Legislature regarding the status of preschool education in the State and the efficacy of the mixed delivery method of preschool education.

In the 2009-2010 school year the school district may also receive start-up funds in accordance with regulations adopted by the commissioner. (5)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection to the contrary, beginning with the first full school year next following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and for a period of five school years, a school district that receives an allocation of preschool education aid based on the amount of Early Launch to Learning Initiative aid received in a previous school year or the amount of Early Childhood Program Aid received in a previous school year shall have the proportion of its preschool education aid based on the amount of Early Launch to Learning Initiative aid previously received or the amount of Early Childhood Program Aid previously received reduced in each year and the proportion of its preschool education aid calculated pursuant to subsection a. of this section increased in each year.  This transition shall be done in a manner determined by the Commissioner of Education, except that the commissioner shall ensure that at the end of five full school years following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), all school districts receive allocations of preschool education aid calculated pursuant to subsection a. of this section, and no school district receives an allocation of preschool education aid based on the amount of Early Launch to Learning Initiative aid received in a previous school year or the amount of Early Childhood Program Aid received in a previous school year. d.    For the 2008-2009 school year, the preschool per pupil aid amounts shall be $11,506 for pupils enrolled in an in-district program, $12,934 for pupils enrolled in a licensed child care provider program, and $7,146 for pupils enrolled in a Head Start Program.  The preschool per pupil aid amounts shall be adjusted by the CPI in the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years as required pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of this act.  For subsequent school years, the preschool per pupil aid amounts shall be established in the Educational Adequacy Report, with the amounts adjusted by the CPI for each of the two school years following the first school year to which the report is applicable. e.     A district shall appropriate preschool education aid in a special revenue fund for expenditure.

The Department of Education may utilize up to $250,000 of any appropriation for preschool education aid to contract temporary staff to assist with the preparation of the report issued pursuant to this section. 6.   This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill defines preschool expansion aid, establishes eligibility criteria for the aid, and creates requirements for recipients of preschool expansion aid. Additionally, the bill makes changes to the calculation of preschool education aid. Under current law, school districts are required to provide certain thresholds of free preschool education opportunities based on the districts district factor group (DFG) and concentration of at-risk students. DFGs are determined using multiple indicators of socioeconomic status, including attainment rates for high school diplomas and college education, occupational status, unemployment rate, poverty rate, and median family income.  DFGs have not been updated since 2004. This bill removes the distinction between DFGs for both the determination of preschool education aid and the thresholds of free preschool education opportunities that are required under current law.  Under the bill, all districts would be required to provide free preschool education opportunities for all three- and four-year old pupils in the district, to the extent possible based on the amount of preschool education aid provided to the district, by a date determined by each school district.  The Commissioner of Education may require a school district to resubmit the districts plan for the provision of free access to full-day preschool at any time following the initial submission.  The bill allows any district that operates a preschool program to apply to the commissioner for approval to establish tuition based on a familys ability to pay if the district is able to demonstrate that the districts finances would not support a free full-day preschool program and that establishing tuition would allow the district to enroll substantially more at-risk students.  Under the bill, preschool expansion aid would be provided to a district in any year in which free preschool opportunities are not provided to all three- and four- year olds in the district. The bill provides that each school district is required to submit a plan to the Commissioner of Education by July 1, 2025 to reach free access to full-day preschool for all three- and four-year old pupils by a date determined by the district.  A school district that does not offer full-day kindergarten is to include in its submission a plan for the provision of full-day kindergarten.  Subsequently, the commissioner is required to prepare and make public a Statewide strategic plan to achieve full implementation of full-day preschool education.  The plan is to be based on the plans submitted by each school district and is required to be posted on the departments Internet website and submitted to the Governor, and to the Legislature no later than July 1, 2026. Preschool expansion aid is defined under the bill as any portion of Preschool Education Aid allocated by the Commissioner of Education for the purpose of expanding free access to preschool for resident three- and four-year old children, or any other State funds appropriated for the same purpose.  To be eligible to receive preschool expansion aid, a district is required to offer full-day kindergarten, however, the commissioner may waive this requirement if there is sufficient funding.  In determining preschool expansion aid award amounts and recipients, the commissioner is to give preference to districts in accordance with the concentration of at-risk students. Recipients of preschool expansion aid would be required to implement a mixed delivery method, whereby a mix of district programs, licensed child care provider programs, and Head Start Programs are utilized in the delivery of preschool education.  In establishing a mixed delivery method, a school district is to partner with any licensed child care provider that is able to demonstrate an ability to meet the Elements of High Quality Preschool Programs promulgated by the Department of Education and all applicable Preschool Program Implementation Guidelines. The district is required to ensure that free preschool opportunities are first provided to at-risk students.  In addition, a school district is required under the bill to provide payments to a partnering licensed child care provider that are only based on the contracted number of seats agreed upon by the school district and the licensed child care provider, provided that average provider enrollment exceeds 95 percent of contracted slots and providers are permitted to enroll children directly via a centralized system shared with the district in which the licensed child care provider is operating. Finally, the bill requires the Department of Education, the Department of Children and Families, and the Department of Human Services, in consultation with school districts, licensed child care providers, Head Start program providers, and other stakeholders, to submit a report to the Legislature regarding the status of preschool education in the State and the efficacy of the mixed delivery method of preschool education.
