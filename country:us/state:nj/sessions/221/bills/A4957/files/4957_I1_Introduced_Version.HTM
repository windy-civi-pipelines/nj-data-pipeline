"Housing provider" means a landlord, an owner, lessor, sublessor, assignee, or their agent, or any other person receiving or entitled to receive rents or benefits for the use or occupancy of any rental dwelling unit, except that this term shall not include a county or municipality that directly rents one or more residential units to a tenant or tenants.

During 2021, the Legislature enacted the "Fair Chance in Housing Act" for the purpose of establishing certain housing rights for persons with criminal records.  That enactment was designed to expand opportunities for people with criminal records to find safe, affordable housing and reduce recidivism.  Since enactment of the "Fair Chance in Housing Act," it has been disputed whether the acts provisions apply to a county or municipal government that directly rent one or more residential units to one or more tenants.  This bill resolves those disputes by specifically providing that the "Fair Chance in Housing Act" does not apply to a county or municipal or county government that directly rents one or more residential units to one or more tenants.
