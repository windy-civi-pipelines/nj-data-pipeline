An Act concerning effective dates of coverage under the State Health Benefits Program for eligible resident and fellow physicians employed by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and supplementing P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, an eligible resident or fellow physician employed by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, including University Hospital, and that persons dependents, shall be eligible to enroll for health care coverage under the State Health Benefits Program on the first day of employment if that employment begins on or after the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  An eligible resident or fellow physician who is employed by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, including University Hospital, on the effective date of this act, and that persons dependents, shall be eligible to enroll for health care coverage under the State Health Benefits Program immediately on that effective date. 2.  This act shall take effect immediately.

Delays in health care coverage and access to life-saving medicine can be dangerous and cause debilitating health care debt during emergencies.  In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Governor signed Executive Order 172 allowing public employees to immediately enroll in the SHBP.  However, the ability to immediately enroll was eliminated when the Governor later signed Executive Order 244 in 2021, which ended the public health emergency.  This bill provides for immediate enrollment for eligible resident and fellow physicians employed by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, including University Hospital, and their dependents.
