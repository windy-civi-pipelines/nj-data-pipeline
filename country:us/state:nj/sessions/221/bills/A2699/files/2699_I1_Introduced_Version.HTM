area&quot; means the preservation area of the Highlands Region designated by
subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-7);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Highlands Region means the
region so designated by subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.2004, c.120
(C13:20-7);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Qualified
municipality&quot; means any municipality located entirely in the Highlands
preservation area; or a municipality wherein, of the total municipal land area
that is located in the Highlands Region, at least 60 percent of that land is
located in the Highlands preservation area; and which has conformed its
municipal master plan and development regulations to the Highlands regional
master plan pursuant to section 14 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-14);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Tax rate&quot; means
that portion of the effective property tax rate for the current tax year which
reflects local taxes to be raised for district school purposes and local
municipal purposes, calculated by dividing the total of column 12, section C by
net valuation on which county taxes are apportioned in column 11, both as
reflected in the Abstract of Ratables for the current tax year, and expressed
as a rate per $100 of true value;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;True value of vacant
land&quot; or &quot;true value&quot; means the aggregate assessed value of
vacant land divided by the average ratio of assessed-to-true value of real
property (commonly known as the equalization rate) promulgated by the Director
of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury and published in
the table of equalized valuation; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Valuation base&quot;

municipality when comparing the current tax year to the base year.</p>

following the enactment of P.L.   , c.    (C.     ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill), the Director of the Division of Taxation in the
Department of the Treasury shall establish procedures for determining the valuation
base of a qualified municipality, whether fiscal stress has been caused by the
implementation of the &quot;Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act,&quot;
P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.) in a qualified municipality, and the amount
due to a qualified municipality to compensate for a decline in the aggregate
true value of vacant land directly attributable to the implementation of the
&quot;Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The &quot;Highlands
Preservation Area Municipal Property Tax Relief Fund&quot; is established in
the General Fund as a special nonlapsing fund for the purpose of providing
State aid to qualified municipalities pursuant to this section.  There shall be
credited each State fiscal year from the &quot;Highlands Protection Fund&quot;
to the Highlands Preservation Area Municipal Property Tax Relief Fund such
sums as shall be necessary to provide State aid to qualified municipalities
pursuant to this section.  Every qualified municipality shall be eligible for a
distribution from the fund pursuant to the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The assessor of every
qualified municipality shall certify to the county board of taxation on a form
to be prescribed by the Director of the Division of Taxation, and on or before
December 1 annually, a report of the assessed value of each parcel of vacant
land in the base year and the change in the assessed value of each such parcel
in the current tax year attributable to successful appeals of assessed values
of vacant land to the county board of taxation pursuant to R.S.54:3-21 et seq.
or attributable to a revaluation approved by the director and implemented or a
reassessment approved by the county board of taxation.  If a judgment or an
appeal is overturned or modified, upon a final judgment an appropriate
adjustment shall be made by the director in the payment of the entitlement due
next following the judgment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  Upon receipt of reports
filed pursuant to subsection c. of this section and using procedures developed
by the Director of the Division of Taxation pursuant to paragraph (1) of
subsection b. of this section, the county tax administrator shall compute and
certify to the director on or before December 20 of each year, in such manner
as to identify for each qualified municipality the aggregate decline, if any, in
the true value of vacant land, comparing the current tax year to the base year.
The aggregate changes so identified for each qualified municipality shall

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require the
distribution of State aid to municipalities located in whole, or in part, in
the Highlands preservation area of the Highlands Region.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Highlands Region was
designated in the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, P.L.2004,
c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.), which controls and limits, as appropriate,
development in the New Jersey Highlands, an essential source of drinking water
for one-half of the States population, covering portions of 88 municipalities
in seven counties, through a regional approach to land use planning and more
stringent environmental standards.  The Highlands Region consists of a planning
area and a preservation area.  The law designated a preservation area of the
New Jersey Highlands to be subject to stringent standards governing major
development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As part of the Highlands
Water and Planning Protection Act, the Legislature included a 10-year State
aid program to municipalities located in whole or in part in the Highlands
preservation area, to provide these municipalities with funds for the vacant
land that was subject to development restrictions.  Due to State budgetary
restrictions, the FY 2010 Appropriations Act was the last State budget that
provided this aid.  However, the land in the preservation area is still subject
to the permanent development restrictions enacted in the Highlands Water
Protection and Planning Act, and therefore, municipalities located in the
preservation area have little ability to approve development projects that will
provide property tax relief to property taxpayers.  This bill is intended to
provide a new, permanent State program to provide property tax relief to the
taxpayers in those municipalities located in whole, or in part, in the
preservation of the Highlands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish the
&quot;Highlands Preservation Area Municipal Property Tax Relief Fund&quot; in
the General Fund as a special nonlapsing fund for the purpose of providing
State aid to qualified municipalities pursuant to the bill.  In each State
fiscal year, the bill requires that there be credited from the &quot;Highlands
Protection Fund&quot; to the Highlands Preservation Area Municipal Property
Tax Relief Fund such sums as shall be necessary to provide State aid to
qualified municipalities.  A qualified municipality under the bill would be a
municipality located entirely in the Highlands preservation area; or a
municipality wherein, of the total municipal land area that is located in the
Highlands Region, at least 60 percent of that land is located in the Highlands
preservation area; and which has conformed its municipal master plan and
development regulations to the Highlands regional master plan pursuant to the
Highlands Water and Planning Protection Act.  Under the bill, every qualified
municipality would be eligible for a distribution from the fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would set property
tax year 2023 (calendar year 2023) as the base year for the calculation of the
State aid to be provided under the bill.  The bill would require the assessor
of every qualified municipality to certify to the county tax board on or before
December 1 annually, a report of the assessed value of each parcel of vacant
land in the base year and the change in the assessed value of each such parcel
in the current tax year attributable to successful appeals of assessed values
of vacant land to the county tax board, or attributable to a revaluation
approved by the director and implemented or a reassessment approved by the
county board of taxation.  Upon receipt of these reports, the county tax board
would compute and certify to the director on or before December 20 of each
year, in such manner as to identify for each qualified municipality the
aggregate decline, if any, in the true value of vacant land, comparing the
current tax year to the base year.  The aggregate changes identified for each
qualified municipality would constitute its valuation base.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The State Treasurer would
certify to each qualified municipality, on or before February 15, its property
tax stabilization amount, and the State Treasurer would pay to each qualified
municipality its State aid in two equal installments, pursuant to a schedule
prescribed by the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of
Community Affairs.  The bill would require that, in the event the amount
available in the &quot;Highlands Preservation Area Municipal Property Tax
Relief Fund&quot; in any year is insufficient to pay the full amount to which
each qualified municipality is entitled, the payments would be made from the
Property Tax Relief Fund.</p>
