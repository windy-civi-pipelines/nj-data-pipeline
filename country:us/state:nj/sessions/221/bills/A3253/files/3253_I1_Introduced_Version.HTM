Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development set by regulation requirements
regarding work quotas in warehouse distribution centers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires all
employers to provide paid meal periods of at least 30 minutes for employees who
work for more than five hours continuously, and paid rest periods of at least a
15 minutes for any continuous work period of more than four hours.  Current New
Jersey law requires 30-minute meal breaks for minors who work five or more
continuous hours, but has no requirement for adults, and no requirement for
rest breaks for adults or minors.  21 states currently require meal breaks for
adults and six of those states also have rest break requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
commissioner to adopt regulations setting requirements for work quotas in
covered warehouse facilities to assure that the quotas:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    include the quantified
number of tasks to be performed or materials to be produced or handled, within
the defined time period, and any potential adverse employment action that could
result from failure to meet the quota;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    do not result in rates
of work or workloads under which the wages paid are not fairly and reasonably
commensurate with the value of the service provided;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    permit rates of work and
workloads which workers can maintain on a sustained basis, and do not result in
high levels of turnover of the workforce, or otherwise adversely affect the
general well-being and efficiency of the workers; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    do not prevent
compliance with required meal and rest periods, prevent needed use of bathroom
facilities, prevent breaks or other accommodations required by the Law Against
Discrimination in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding, or hinder any
other accommodations required pursuant to any State or federal
anti-discrimination or safety and health laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In setting requirements for
quotas, the commissioner is directed to consider information regarding quotas
imposed by warehouse employers, data regarding the rates of work and workloads
in warehouses, information regarding adverse impacts of excessive work speeds
on warehouse workers, data on turnover rates and wage levels in warehouses in
this State and elsewhere, and the adequacy of those wage levels to meet a cost
of living necessary for health and well-being.  The commissioner is also
directed to consult with warehouse employer organization representatives,
representatives of labor organizations representing warehouse employees, and
individuals not employed by those organizations who have expertise regarding
the effects of work speed and quotas on the well-being, efficiency, and
turnover rates of warehouse workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Warehouse employers are
required to provide employees with a written description of quotas to which the
employee is subject.  The employers are prohibited from requiring any employee
to meet a quota that violates any requirement set by the regulation pursuant to
the bill, and are prohibited from taking any adverse employment action against
an employee for failure to meet a quota that does not meet the requirements set
those regulations or for failure to meet a quota which the employer has failed to
disclose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Actions taken by an employee
to comply with occupational health and safety laws or standards are considered
productive time for purposes of any quota or monitoring system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current and former employees
who believe that meeting a quota caused a violation of the provisions of the
bill are given the right to obtain from an employer a written description of
each quota and employees own personal work speed data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any employer who violates the
bill's provisions is subject to sanctions in the &quot;New Jersey State Wage
and Hour Law.&quot;</p>
