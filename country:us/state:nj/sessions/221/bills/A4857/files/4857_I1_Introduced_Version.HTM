(cf: P.L.2023, c.155, s.10) 5.  Section 11 of P.L.2023, c.155 (C.2A:53A-59) is amended to read as follows: 11.  Construction. a. This act shall be broadly construed and applied to protect the exercise of the right of freedom of speech and of the press, the right to assembly and petition, and the right of association, guaranteed by the United States Constitution or the New Jersey Constitution. b.  This act shall also be broadly construed and applied in furtherance of the goals of the Law Against Discrimination, N.J.S.10:5-1 et seq., and for the protection of victims of sexual offenses. (cf: P.L.2023, c.155, s.11) 6.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill extends the States anti-SLAPP law, P.L.2023, c.155 (N.J.S.A.2A:53A-49 et seq.), to protect persons who make a report or complaint of sexual assault, harassment, or discrimination. A SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) is typically a lawsuit, such as a defamation lawsuit, filed in retaliation against a victim, complainant, witness, whistleblower, advocate, or journalist in order to intimidate or silence the person from speaking out.  As demonstrated by the #MeToo movement, victims of sexual assault, harassment, and discrimination may be reluctant to come forward due to fear of retaliation, including fear of SLAPP suits. Under existing law, a person facing a SLAPP suit can file an order to show cause with the court to dismiss the SLAPP claim if it can be shown that the SLAPP claim was asserted based on the persons (1) communication in a legislative, executive, judicial, administrative, or other governmental proceeding; (2) communication on an issue under consideration or review in a legislative, executive, judicial, administrative, or other governmental proceeding; or (3) exercise of the right of freedom of speech or of the press, the right to assembly or petition, or the right of association, guaranteed by the United States Constitution or the New Jersey Constitution, on a matter of public concern.  If the SLAPP claim is dismissed, the person can recover litigation costs and reasonable attorneys fees. Under the bill, anti-SLAPP protections are extended to persons who make a report or complaint, in good faith and without malice, of: a sexual offense pursuant to chapter 14 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes or N.J.S.2C:24-4, or a violation of the Law Against Discrimination, N.J.S.10:5-1 et seq., or an incident of retaliation for the making of such a report or complaint, where the person has, or at any time had, a reasonable basis to make such a report or complaint, whether or not a criminal prosecution or civil or administrative action was actually initiated.  The bill also allows a person who successfully dismisses a SLAPP claim to be awarded compensatory and punitive damages, in addition to litigation costs and attorneys fees.
