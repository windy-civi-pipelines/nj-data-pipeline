class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning protection of the Barnegat Bay estuary
watershed, amending P.L.1955, c.49, and supplementing various parts of the
statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)    Sections
1 through 7 of this act shall be known and may be cited as the Barnegat Bay Protection
Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)    The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     New Jerseys Barnegat
Bay estuary watershed is one of the States most precious natural resources,
and this shallow lagoonal estuary is now significantly affected by an array of
human impacts that potentially threaten its ecological integrity;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Barnegat Bay estuary
watershed encompasses most of the 33 municipalities in Ocean County and four
municipalities in Monmouth County, supports a population of over 500,000 people
that more than doubles during the summer season, and also provides economic,
ecological, aesthetic, and recreational benefits;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Eutrophication exists
in the Barnegat Bay, caused in part by nutrient loadings from nonpoint pollution
sources and evidenced by the decline of seagrass and hard clams and the
increase of harmful algae, drift algae, and other noxious species, and studies
show that increased development has caused pollutant loadings from nitrogen and
phosphorus to grow;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    In order to preserve the
  Barnegat Bay estuary watershed, help is urgently needed to protect the bay
from pollution; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     It is therefore
altogether fitting and proper for the State to create a special fund dedicated
to protecting the Barnegat Bay estuary watershed, and support the fund by:  (1)
dedicating a portion of sales tax revenues collected from the sale of
fertilizer; (2) authorizing special license plates; and (3) soliciting and
accepting donations, including at the time of application or renewal of a
license to operate a personal watercraft or power vessel and registration or
renewal of a vessel, and at the point of purchase of a beach tag or beach
badge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  a.  There
is created in the Department of the Treasury a special non-lapsing fund to be
known as the Barnegat Bay Protection Fund.  There shall be deposited in the
fund: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   amounts collected from
the retail sale of fertilizer pursuant to section 4 of P.L.    ,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ) (pending before the Legislature as
this bill);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   amounts collected from specialty
license plate fees pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c.   (C.     ) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill); </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   amounts collected from
donations, at the time an application is submitted or a fee is paid, for an
operators license of a personal watercraft or power vessel, pursuant to
section 6 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill); </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   amounts collected from
donations, at the time a fee is paid, for the initial registration of a
documented vessel and for each renewal thereof, pursuant to section 7 of
P.L.    , c.   (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   amounts collected from
donations, received at the time of registration of persons by a municipality
for access to a beach and bathing and recreational grounds, pursuant to subsection
d. of section 1 of P.L.1955, c.49 (C.40:61-22.20); and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   amounts received from
donations collected pursuant to subsection d. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Monies deposited in the
fund shall be distributed, at the discretion of the State Treasurer in
consultation with the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, and expended exclusively
for the purposes of preservation and remediation of the Barnegat Bay estuary
watershed, which may include a public education campaign about the importance
of protecting, and measures and actions that can be taken to preserve, the Barnegat
Bay estuary watershed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Prior to distribution,
monies deposited in the fund shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in
public depositories as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.236
(C.17:9-41), and may be invested or reinvested in such securities as are
approved by the State Treasurer. Interest or other income earned on monies
deposited in the fund, and any monies which may be appropriated or otherwise
become available for the purposes of the fund, shall be credited to and
deposited in the fund for use as set forth in P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Department of the
Treasury, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, may
solicit and accept donations, by gift, bequest, or devise, from any person or
entity, for deposit into the Barnegat Bay Protection Fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The State Treasurer, in
consultation with the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, shall annually
submit a report on the Barnegat Bay Protection Fund to the Legislature,
pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1).  The annual report

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, to be known as the
Barnegat Bay Protection Act, would establish the Barnegat Bay Protection Fund
to support and help protect, preserve, and remediate the Barnegat Bay
estuary and its watershed.  The fund would be supported through: (1) dedication
of a portion of the sales tax on fertilizer; (2) authorization of special
Protect Barnegat Bay license plates; and (3) donations, including those that
may be made at the time of application or renewal of a license to operate a
personal watercraft or power vessel, at the time of registration or renewal of
a vessel, or at the time a beach badge or tag fee is collected anywhere in the
State.  Monies in the fund would be used exclusively for the purposes of
preservation and remediation of the Barnegat Bay estuary watershed, which may
include a public education campaign about the importance of protecting the Barnegat
 Bay and measures and actions that can be taken to preserve it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 3 of the bill
establishes the Barnegat Bay Protection Fund, a special non-lapsing fund in the
Department of the Treasury.  Monies deposited into the fund would include the
amounts collected from specialty license plate fees, donations at the time of
boat registration or renewal, the dedication of 1% of the sales tax on fertilizer,
and donations at the point of purchase of a beach registration fee (i.e., a
beach badge or beach tag), or other donations made to the fund.  Monies
deposited are to be distributed, at the discretion of the State Treasurer in
consultation with the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, and expended exclusively
for the purposes of the preservation and remediation of the Barnegat
 Bay estuary watershed.  The State Treasurer, in consultation with the
Commissioner of Environmental Protection, would annually submit to the
Legislature a report on the fund, concerning the monies received and spent.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes the
solicitation and acceptance of donations, by gift, bequest, or devise, from any
person or entity, for deposit into the Barnegat Bay Protection Fund.  The
bill also provides that 1% of the sales and use tax collected only on the
retail sale of fertilizer would be deposited into the fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes the
issuance of Protect Barnegat Bay license plates, which would indicate support
for, and an interest in, funding the protection, preservation and remediation
of the Barnegat Bay estuary watershed.  The design of the license plate would
be chosen by the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission
(MVC) in consultation with the Commissioner of Environmental Protection.  In
order to obtain or renew a Protect Barnegat Bay license plate, a person would
be required to pay a $50 initial fee, in addition to the ordinary registration
fees required by law, and a $10 annual renewal fee, in addition to the ordinary
renewal fees required by law, each of which fees would be deposited into the Barnegat
Bay Protection Fund. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At the time the fee is paid
for a license to operate a personal watercraft or power vessel, or for the
registration or renewal of a certificate of number (registration) for a vessel,
the Chief Administrator of the MVC, or the chief administrators
representative, would be required to inform an applicant that the applicant may
make a donation to the Barnegat Bay Protection Fund and how that donation may
be made.  A donation would be paid to the chief administrator and forwarded to
the State Treasurer for deposit into the Barnegat Bay Protection Fund.  An
applicant could not be denied an operators license or a certificate of
registration based on whether the person did or did not donate to the fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that, for any municipality charging and collecting a beach badge or beach tag fee,
the municipality may provide an opportunity for a person purchasing a badge or
tag to donate to the Barnegat Bay Protection Fund at the time the fee is collected. 
Any monies collected from donations made at the point of purchase of a beach
badge or tag would be forwarded to the State Treasurer to be deposited into the
fund.  A municipality would be prohibited from denying the purchase of a beach
badge or tag based on whether a person did or did not donate to the fund.</p>
