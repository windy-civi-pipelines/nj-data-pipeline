<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a. The Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey, including any of its subsidiary corporations, shall
not compensate any commissioner, officer, or employee in the form of an
allowance or reimbursement for expenses related to the use of a vehicle that is
procured by or for the commissioner, officer, or employee primarily for
personal use or for the purpose of commuting between home and work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    No current or former
commissioner, officer, or employee of the port authority, or of any of its
subsidiary corporations, shall be exempt from payment of any toll relating to
the persons use of a port authority toll bridge or toll road, or of any fare
relating to the persons use of the transportation services of the port
authority, and the port authority, including any of its subsidiary
corporations, shall not compensate any such commissioner, officer, or employee
in the form of an allowance or reimbursement for payment of any such toll or
fare or for payment of any other expenses for commuting between home and work
or for travel not directly related to the public business of the port authority.
 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The port authority
shall not provide to any commissioner, officer, or employee of the port
authority, or of any of its subsidiary corporations, a driver whose assigned
full-time or part-time duties are to operate any motor vehicle in which the
commissioner, officer, or employee, or an immediate family member of a
commissioner, officer, or employee is a passenger, unless the driver is a law
enforcement officer who is assigned also to provide for the security of the
commissioner, officer, or employee when the need for such security has been
documented.  For the purposes of this subsection, immediate family member of
a person means the persons spouse and any parent, child, or sibling of the
person residing in the same household as the person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The port authority,
including any of its subsidiary corporations, shall not compensate any
commissioner, officer, or employee in the form of an allowance or reimbursement
for the cost of overnight travel on behalf of the port authority or for
purposes of conducting port authority business unless such travel arrangements
and the pertinent itinerary shall first have been approved in writing by the
port authority commissioners at a public meeting; provided, however, that this
subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the reimbursement of any
commissioner, officer, or employee for the cost of overnight travel in emergent
situations relating to the port authoritys business.  Any payment made for
travel expenses in accordance with this subsection shall be made as a
reimbursement for allowable expenses, and such reimbursement shall be made
after the date of travel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The port authority,
including any of its subsidiary corporations, shall not extend to any
commissioner, officer, or employee a personal line of credit or any other form
of credit agreement unless the use of credit is directly related and essential
to the performance of those official duties of the commissioner, officer, or
employee as documented in writing, that concern the maintenance of security for
specified persons or property, law enforcement, inspections or audits of
regulated facilities, entities, or persons, or the health, safety, and welfare
of members of the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     No commissioner,
officer, or employee of the port authority of any or of its subsidiary
corporations shall receive any personal expense allowance, or be authorized to
charge any contingent fund or account for personal or official expenses except
where such allowance or fund is expressly provided for by statute or
legislative appropriation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    No commissioner,
officer, or employee of the port authority or of any of its subsidiary corporations
shall receive an allowance, stipend, subsidy, reimbursement, or other form of
payment for the purchase, lease, or maintenance of a residence, and no such
individual shall accept use of a residence owned or leased by the port
authority or any of its subsidiary corporations for any purpose not directly
related and essential to the performance of those official duties of the
officer or employee, as documented in writing, that concern the maintenance of
security for specified persons or property, law enforcement, or the health,
safety, and welfare of members of the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The port authority shall
not reimburse any officer or employee of the port authority or of any of its
subsidiary corporations for attendance of courses at an institution of higher education
unless (1) the course is taken at an accredited public institution of higher
education in New York or New Jersey, including a county college, (2) the course
is directly related to the skills and knowledge required for the duties being
performed by the officer or employee, or required for the performance of the
duties of a position to which the officer or employee may directly be promoted
from the current position, and (3) the officer or employee agrees to remain an
officer or employee for five years after the final tuition reimbursement is
made.  The amount of any reimbursement hereunder shall be limited to 50 percent
of the tuition for the course attended.  If the officer or employee does not
remain an officer or employee of the port authority for that period of time,
the officer or employee shall be required to pay the port authority for all
tuition reimbursements made.  If the officer or employee does not maintain a C
average or its equivalent for courses attended, the officer or employee shall
not receive payment or reimbursement for tuition. This subsection shall not
apply to tuition reimbursement for a course or program that provides a
certification of a skill or understanding sufficient to perform or assess a
particular technological, mechanical, industrial, operational, accounting, or
construction process or function, and that certification is required for
holding that office or employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a. No commissioner,
officer, or employee of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, or any
of its subsidiary corporations, shall solicit, receive or agree to receive,
whether directly or indirectly, any compensation, reward, employment, gift,
honorarium, out-of-State travel or subsistence expense or other thing of value
from any source other than the port authority, for providing any service,
advice, or assistance, making any appearance or speech, or performing any other
action related to the official duties of the commissioner, officer, or
employee, or under any other circumstance which could reasonably be expected to
influence, or which may be reasonably perceived as being expected to influence,
the manner in which a commissioner, officer, or employee conducts the public
business of the port authority; provided however, that a commissioner, officer,
or employee may be compensated by any party for any written publication of the
commissioner, officer, or employee relating to, or concerning that
commissioners, officers, or employees employment or service with the port
authority.</p>
