<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> establishing the Office of New Americans in the
Department of Human Services, and supplementing Title 30 of the Revised
Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  The Legislature finds and
declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  Every New Jersey resident
should be valued, supported, and welcomed as an integral part of our
communities, economy, and culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  New Jersey is home to over
two million immigrants and refugees, who make up nearly one quarter of the
State population.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  New Americans in New
Jersey have diverse backgrounds, experiences, and strengths, and make critical
contributions that benefit all State residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  New Americans are integral
to New Jerseys diverse economy; they are entrepreneurs, workers, students, and
family members who contribute to New Jerseys vibrant communities and cultural
and social fabric, pay taxes, and create jobs through entrepreneurship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  New Americans make up a
substantial part of the States labor force in a wide range of industries,
including health care, social assistance, manufacturing, and construction, and
assist the State in maintaining its role as a leading innovator in the science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics field.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  New Americans play a
disproportionately large role in maintaining New Jerseys health and safety by
performing essential services during emergencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  New Americans face unique
obstacles while contributing to New Jerseys communities and economies.  A
legacy of inequitable policies has undermined the safety of New American
communities, hindered trust between the government and New Americans, and limited
New Americans access to resources, services, and opportunities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  Implementing policies and
programming that are welcoming, responsive, and respectful to New Americans is
essential to New Jerseys success and building trust between immigrant
communities and the government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.  The Office of New
Americans was created in the Department of Human Services following the
issuance of Executive Order 74 of 2019 to support immigrants and refugees in
New Jersey through outreach, education, legal services, and other initiatives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.  The New Jersey Office of
New Americans has played an important role in understanding the needs of
immigrants and refugees.  The office has also shared its expertise in order to
inform and strengthen the States engagement with New Americans, especially
during recent crises, through outreach, training, and technical assistance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.  The New Jersey Office of
New Americans improves access to critical services and resources, including
refugee resettlement services, to respond to humanitarian crises and to support
New Americans health, wellbeing, and integration into New Jerseys communities. 
The office has administered support to over 3,000 refugees who have arrived to
the State in the past ten years from countries such as Cuba, Syria,
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Democratic Republic of Congo.  The office also
administers a legal services program that has supported nearly 5,000 New
Americans over the past five years to prevent separation from families and
communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.  Maintaining the New Jersey
Office of New Americans, and ensuring that the office has funding and
resources, will further strengthen the collaborative efforts of the State and
immigrant communities to provide, and continue improving access, to services
for New Americans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  As used in this act, <span
