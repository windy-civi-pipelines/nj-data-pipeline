<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      Under current law, the Executive branch of State
government is required to review and evaluate certain State development
subsidies, including tax expenditures, to determine if the tax incentives have
met expectations.  State tax expenditures and preferences are special or
selective tax relief or benefits authorized by law that are designed to
accomplish certain public goals by forgoing State tax dollars to the direct
benefit of certain taxpayers.  The relief or benefit provided through tax
expenditures typically is intended to encourage investment, create jobs, and
facilitate economic development or to relieve the tax on certain favored or
important products, services, or financial decisions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      This bill enhances the current review and evaluation
required of the specific goals, purposes, and objectives that each State tax
expenditure is intended to achieve. The bill requires an enhanced annual
evaluation of specific data collection and improved reporting requirements
imposed upon the recipient of tax expenditures, the comprehensive presentation
of the State costs of development subsidies, including tax expenditures, and
review of the specific data and baseline measurements to be collected and
remitted in each year that a tax expenditure is in effect, necessary to measure
any change in performance indicators for evaluation of the overall benefit of
tax expenditures, and a return on investment analysis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      The bill amends the definition of development
subsidy to increase the threshold of a reportable subsidy from $25,000 to
$100,000 for purposes of the Development Subsidy Job Goals Accountability Act. 
The bill also prohibits the granting body or State Treasurer or any current or
former employee of either, or any person who has secured information, from
divulging, disclosing, examining for any reason other than required in the
performance of official duties, or using for their own personal advantage
information obtained from the applications submitted to granting bodies
pursuant to that act and from the progress reports filed pursuant to that act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
bill modifies the definition of State tax expenditure in section 1 of the
bill to specify that for purposes of the State tax expenditure report,
currently required by law to be transmitted to the Legislature as part of the
Governors annual budget message, State tax expenditures are </span>those
revenue losses attributable to provisions of State tax law which <span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>deviate from the generally applicable tax structure. 
Currently, State tax expenditures are defined as those revenue losses
attributable to provisions of State tax law which establish special tax
treatment.  The bill also changes the definition of tax expenditure in
section 2 of the bill to make the definition of tax expenditure used in the
Development Subsidy Job Goals Accountability Act consistent with the definition
of State tax expenditure for purposes of the State tax expenditure reporting
requirements in section 1 of the bill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
bill requires that each recipient entity of a development subsidy include on
their progress reports to the granting body,  </span>information concerning the
recipients supplier diversity goals and policies, including amounts paid,
during the previous fiscal year for products and services supplied by a female
business, a small business, a minority business, or a veteran-owned business as
defined by the bill. Further, the supplier diversity information provided is to
be summarized and included in the annual Unified Economic Development Budget
Report, prepared by the State Treasurer and transmitted to the Legislature as
part of the Governors Budget Message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires that
the annual State tax expenditure report detail instances in which the benefit
of a particular State tax expenditure exceeds 10 percent of the recipients
State tax liability.</p>
