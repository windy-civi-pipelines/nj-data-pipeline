the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 9 of P.L.1996,
c.138 (C.18A:7F-9) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.  a.  In order to receive
any State aid pursuant to P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.), a school
district, charter school, renaissance school project, county vocational school
district, or county special services school district shall comply with the
rules and standards for the equalization of opportunity which have been or may
hereafter be prescribed by law or formulated by the commissioner pursuant to
law, including those implementing P.L.1996, c.138 (C.18A:7F-1 et al.) and
P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.) or related to the core curriculum content
standards required by P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.), and shall further
comply with any directive issued by the commissioner pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1996,
c.138 (C.18A:7F-6).  The commissioner is hereby authorized to withhold all or
part of a district's State aid for failure to comply with any rule, standard or
directive.  No State aid shall be paid to any district which has not provided
public school facilities for at least 180 days during the preceding school
year, but the commissioner, for good cause shown, may remit the penalty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection a. of this section to the contrary, in the event that
a school district is required to close the schools of the district for <u>one
or</u> more <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>than
three consecutive<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
school days due to <u>inclement weather or hazardous transportation conditions,</u>
a declared state of emergency, <u>a</u> declared public health emergency, or a
directive by the appropriate health agency or officer to institute a public
health-related closure, the commissioner shall allow the district to apply to
the 180-day requirement established pursuant to subsection a. of this section,
one or more days of virtual or remote instruction provided to students on the
day or days the schools of the district were closed if the program of virtual
or remote instruction meets such criteria as may be established by the
commissioner.  A district that wants to use a program of virtual or remote
instruction to meet the 180-day requirement in accordance with this subsection
shall, with board of education approval, submit its proposed program of virtual
or remote instruction to the commissioner within 30 days of the effective date
of P.L.2020, c.27 and annually thereafter, provided</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>however that if the school district
is unable to complete and submit its proposed program within the 30-day period
and the district is required to close its schools for <u>inclement weather or
hazardous transportation conditions,</u> a declared state of emergency, <u>a</u>
declared public health emergency, or a directive by the appropriate health
agency or officer to institute a public health-related closure, the
commissioner may retroactively approve the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A day of virtual or remote
instruction, if instituted under a program approved by the commissioner, shall
be considered the equivalent of a full day of school attendance for the
purposes of meeting State and local graduation requirements, the awarding of
course credit, and such other matters as determined by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a program of virtual or
remote instruction is implemented for the general education students the same
educational opportunities shall be provided to students with disabilities. 
Special education and related services, including speech language services,
counseling services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and behavioral
services, may be delivered to students with disabilities through the use of
electronic communication or a virtual or online platform and as required by the
student's Individualized Education Program (IEP), to the greatest extent
practicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In the event that the
State or local health department determines that it is advisable to close or
mandates closure of the schools of a school district due to a declared state of
emergency, declared public health emergency, or a directive by the appropriate
health agency or officer to institute a public health-related closure, <u>or in
the event that there is inclement weather or hazardous transportation
conditions that requires the closure of the schools of a school district for
one or more school days,</u> the superintendent of schools shall have the
authority to implement the school district's program of virtual or remote
instruction.  The superintendent shall consult with the board of education
prior to such decision if practicable.  The superintendent shall ensure that
students, parents, staff, and the board of education or boards of education are
informed promptly of the superintendent's decision.</p>
