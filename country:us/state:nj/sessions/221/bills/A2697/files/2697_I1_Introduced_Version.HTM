different manner in the indictment or accusation, subject only to the power of
the court to ensure fair trial by granting a bill of particulars, discovery, a

less than $200; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The property stolen is

Amounts involved in thefts or computer criminal activities committed pursuant
to one scheme or course of conduct, whether from the same person or several

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2C:44-1.  Criteria for
withholding or imposing sentences of imprisonment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2C:44-1.  a.  In determining
the appropriate sentence to be imposed on a person who has been convicted of an
offense, the court shall consider the following aggravating circumstances: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The nature and
circumstances of the offense, and the role of the actor in committing the
offense, including whether or not it was committed in an especially heinous,
cruel, or depraved manner; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The gravity and
seriousness of harm inflicted on the victim, including whether or not the
defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim of the offense
was particularly vulnerable or incapable of resistance due to advanced age,
ill-health, or extreme youth, or was for any other reason substantially
incapable of exercising normal physical or mental power of resistance; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The risk that the
defendant will commit another offense; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A lesser sentence will
depreciate the seriousness of the defendant's offense because it involved a
breach of the public trust under chapters 27 and 30 of this title, or the
defendant took advantage of a position of trust or confidence to commit the
offense; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   There is a substantial
likelihood that the defendant is involved in organized criminal activity; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The extent of the
defendant's prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses of which
the defendant has been convicted; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   The defendant committed
the offense pursuant to an agreement to either pay or be paid for the
commission of the offense and the pecuniary incentive was beyond that inherent
in the offense itself;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   The defendant committed
the offense against a police or other law enforcement officer, correctional
employee or firefighter, acting in the performance of the officer, employee, or
firefighter duties while in uniform or exhibiting evidence of his authority;
the defendant committed the offense because of the status of the victim as a
public servant; or the defendant committed the offense against a sports
official, athletic coach or manager, acting in or immediately following the
performance of the person's duties or because of the person's status as a
sports official, coach or manager; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   The need for deterring
the defendant and others from violating the law; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)    The offense involved
fraudulent or deceptive practices committed against any department or division
of State government; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11)    The imposition of a
fine, penalty, or order of restitution without also imposing a term of
imprisonment would be perceived by the defendant or others merely as part of
the cost of doing business, or as an acceptable contingent business or
operating expense associated with the initial decision to resort to unlawful
practices; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (12)    The defendant
committed the offense against a person who the defendant knew or should have
known was 60 years of age or older, or disabled; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (13)    The defendant, while
in the course of committing or attempting to commit the crime, including the
immediate flight therefrom, used or was in possession of a stolen motor
vehicle; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (14)    The offense involved
an act of domestic violence, as that term is defined in subsection a. of
section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19), committed in the presence of a child
under 16 years of age; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (15)    The offense involved
an act of domestic violence, as that term is defined in subsection a. of
section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19) and the defendant committed at least
one act of domestic violence on more than one occasion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In determining the
appropriate sentence to be imposed on a person who has been convicted of an
offense, the court may properly consider the following mitigating
circumstances: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The defendant's conduct
neither caused nor threatened serious harm; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The defendant did not
contemplate that the defendant's conduct would cause or threaten serious harm; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The defendant acted
under a strong provocation; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   There were substantial
grounds tending to excuse or justify the defendant's conduct, though failing to
establish a defense; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   The victim of the
defendant's conduct induced or facilitated its commission; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The defendant has
compensated or will compensate the victim of the defendant's conduct for the
damage or injury that the victim sustained, or will participate in a program of
community service; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   The defendant has no
history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law-abiding life
for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present offense; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   The defendant's conduct
was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   The character and
attitude of the defendant indicate that the defendant is unlikely to commit
another offense; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)    The defendant is
particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probationary treatment; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11)    The imprisonment of
the defendant would entail excessive hardship to the defendant or the
defendant's dependents; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (12)    The willingness of the
defendant to cooperate with law enforcement authorities; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (13)    The conduct of a
youthful defendant was substantially influenced by another person more mature
than the defendant; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (14)    The defendant was
under 26 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)  A plea of guilty
by a defendant or failure to so plead shall not be considered in withholding or
imposing a sentence of imprisonment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   When imposing a sentence
of imprisonment the court shall consider the defendant's eligibility for
release under the law governing parole, including time credits awarded pursuant
to Title 30 of the Revised Statutes, in determining the appropriate term of
imprisonment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Presumption of
imprisonment.  The court shall deal with a person who has been convicted of a crime
of the first or second degree, or a crime of the third degree where the court
finds that the aggravating factor in paragraph (5), (14), or (15) of subsection
a. of this section applies, by imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless,
having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of the
opinion that the defendant's imprisonment would be a serious injustice which
overrides the need to deter such conduct by others.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsection e. of this section, the court shall deal with a person
who has been convicted of theft of a motor vehicle or of the unlawful taking of
a motor vehicle and who has previously been convicted of either offense by
imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and
condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that imprisonment would be a
serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The court shall deal
with a person convicted of an offense other than a crime of the first or second
degree, who has not previously been convicted of an offense, without imposing a
sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the nature and circumstances
of the offense and the history, character, and condition of the defendant, it is
of the opinion that imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public
under the criteria set forth in subsection a. of this section, except that this
subsection shall not apply if the court finds that the aggravating factor in
paragraph (5), (14) or (15) of subsection a. of this section applies or if the
person is convicted of any of the following crimes of the third degree: theft
of a motor vehicle; <u>theft of a firearm;</u> unlawful taking of a motor
vehicle; eluding; strict liability vehicular homicide pursuant to section 1 of
P.L.2017, c.165 (C.2C:11-5.3); if the person is convicted of a crime of the
third degree constituting use of a false government document in violation of
subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.1983, c.565 (C.2C:21-2.1); if the person is
convicted of a crime of the third degree constituting distribution, manufacture
or possession of an item containing personal identifying information in
violation of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.2003, c.184 (C.2C:21-17.3); if
the person is convicted of a crime of the third or fourth degree constituting
bias intimidation in violation of N.J.S.2C:16-1; if the person is convicted of

section 1 or 2 of P.L.2007, c.341 (C.2C:33-29 or C.2C:33-30).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Presumptive Sentences.
(1) Except for the crime of murder, unless the preponderance of aggravating or
mitigating factors, as set forth in subsections a. and b. of this section,
weighs in favor of a higher or lower term within the limits provided in
N.J.S.2C:43-6, when a court determines that a sentence of imprisonment is
warranted, it shall impose sentence as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   To a term of 20 years
for aggravated manslaughter or kidnapping pursuant to paragraph (1) of
subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:13-1 when the offense constitutes a crime of the
first degree; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Except as provided in
subparagraph (a) of this paragraph to a term of 15 years for a crime of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In imposing a minimum term
pursuant to subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, the sentencing court shall
specifically place on the record the aggravating factors set forth in this
section which justify the imposition of a minimum term. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Unless the preponderance of
mitigating factors set forth in subsection b. weighs in favor of a lower term
within the limits authorized, sentences imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) of
subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-7 shall have a presumptive term of life imprisonment. 
Unless the preponderance of aggravating and mitigating factors set forth in
subsections a. and b. of this section weighs in favor of a higher or lower term
within the limits authorized, sentences imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of
subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-7 shall have a presumptive term of 50 years'
imprisonment; sentences imposed pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of
N.J.S.2C:43-7 shall have a presumptive term of 15 years' imprisonment; and
sentences imposed pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-7
shall have a presumptive term of seven years' imprisonment.</p>

for crimes of the first or second degree where the court is clearly convinced
that the mitigating factors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors and
where the interest of justice demands, the court may sentence the defendant to
a term appropriate to a crime of one degree lower than that of the crime for
which the defendant was convicted.  If the court does impose sentence pursuant
to this paragraph, or if the court imposes a noncustodial or probationary
sentence upon conviction for a crime of the first or second degree, the
sentence shall not become final for 10 days in order to permit the appeal of
the sentence by the prosecution. </p>

factor in paragraph (2), (5), (10), or (12) of subsection a. of this section
and does not impose a custodial sentence, the court shall specifically place on
the record the mitigating factors which justify the imposition of a
noncustodial sentence. </p>

section 2 of P.L.1993, c.123 (C.2C:43-11), the presumption of imprisonment as provided
