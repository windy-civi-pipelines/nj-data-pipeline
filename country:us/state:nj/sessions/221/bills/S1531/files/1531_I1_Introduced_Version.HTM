students living in families eligible to receive free or low-cost school meals.</p>

and declares that New Jersey schools have made great strides in serving
breakfast to more children at the start of the school day, achieving a 73
percent increase since 2010; and that, despite this progress, only 44 percent
of low-income children in New Jersey received breakfast through the federal
School Breakfast Program, according to the most recent data published by
Advocates for Children of New Jersey, and that this means that approximately
304,000 eligible children who <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>are<b><span

served, and that this expansion can<u>,</u> therefore<u>,</u> be easily
accomplished; that, since 2010, the amount of federal school breakfast
reimbursements has more than doubled from about $45 million to an anticipated
$105 million in fiscal year 2018; and that Advocates for Children of New Jersey
estimates that school districts could collect an additional $89 million in
federal funds for school breakfast each year if breakfast is served during the
first few minutes of the school day. </p>

federally eligible for free or reduced price meals.  In addition, the bill
requires any meals provided to students, whether under a school lunch program,
a school breakfast program, a breakfast after the bell program, or a summer
meals program, to be provided to students free of charge, without regard to
each students income eligibility status.  The bill would additionally require
school meals to be provided to students, free of charge, and without regard to
a students eligibility status, whenever a school is required to provide school
meals to students at an external distribution site, due to a public
health-related school closure resulting from the COVID-19 epidemic.  Each
school district, and the Department of Agriculture (DOA), would be required, by
the bill, to publicize, to parents and students, the fact that free meals are
being made available to all students under all of these programs, pursuant to
the bills provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to avoid establishing
an unfunded mandate, the bill would require the State to provide funding to
each school district, as may be necessary to reimburse the costs associated
with the districts provision of free meals to students who are otherwise
ineligible for free or reduced price meals pursuant to the National School
Lunch Program or federal School Breakfast Program.  The bill would further
clarify that, in accordance with federal law, a school district that executes a
summer program meals agreement with the DOA will be eligible to receive
reimbursement from the State for free meals that are provided to students under
a summer meals program operated pursuant to the federal Summer Food Service
Program or the Seamless Summer Option.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bills reimbursement
provisions are is similar to current law, at section 1 of P.L.2019, c.445
(C.18A:33-21.1), which provides that a student who is federally eligible for
reduced price meals shall not be required to pay any cost for those meals, and
that the State shall reimburse schools for the difference between the federal
allocation for reduced price meals and the total cost of the meals served to
public school students who are eligible for reduced price meals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bills provisions,
any school that serves lunch or breakfast and is eligible for the Community
Eligibility Provision (a special assistance alternative federal reimbursement
method that authorizes reimbursement for free school meals provided by
eligible, high-poverty local educational agencies and schools participating in
both the National School Lunch Program and the federal School Breakfast
Program) would be required, to the greatest extent practicable, to participate
in, and maximize the receipt of federal resources available under, that
reimbursement alternative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would further provide
that, if a school participates in a special assistance alternative
reimbursement method authorized under the National School Lunch Program
(including Provision 2, Provision 3, or the Community Eligibility Provision),
the school may determine student eligibility for free or reduced price meals on
a four-year basis (rather than every year) for the purposes of school aid
determinations under the School Funding Reform Act of 2008, P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-43 et seq.).  Specifically, the bill would authorize such a school to
establish a base year, for these purposes, by doing either of the following: 
(1) carrying over, from the school year in which the school initially applied
to participate in the special assistance alternative, the number of students at
the school who were eligible for free or reduced price meals in that base year,
and using each students eligibility status in that base year to report
eligibility for up to each of the following three school years; or (2)
determining the number of students at the school who are currently eligible for
free or reduced price meals, and using each students eligibility status in
that base year to report eligibility for up to each of the following three
school years.  In addition, the bill provides that, whenever a student
transfers, between schools in the same school district, to a school that
participates in a special assistance alternative, documentation supporting the
students eligibility, for the purposes of school aid determinations, may be
transferred from the students old school to the students new school, as long
as the documentation supporting the students eligibility is less than four
years old and is updated at least once every four years thereafter.  To the
extent permitted by federal law, the bill would authorize a school to establish
a new base year, for the purposes of the National School Lunch Program and the
federal School Breakfast Program, at the same time that the school establishes
a new base year for the purposes of school aid determinations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Although the submission of
applications and the performance of eligibility determinations will no longer
be required in order for a student to receive free school meals under the
bills provisions, a school or school district will still need to be aware of a
students income eligibility status in order to:  (1) facilitate school aid
determinations under the School Reform Funding Act of 2008; (2) determine whether
the school is required either to implement a breakfast after the bell program
or to participate in the Summer Food Service Program; and (3) ensure that the
school receives appropriate reimbursement, from State and federal sources, for
meals provided to students free of charge.  As a result, the bill would require
a school district, either at the beginning of each school year or upon a
students initial enrollment, to request that the parent or guardian of each
student complete a household income data collection form, provided by the DOA,
for use in determining the households economic status for these purposes. 
This requirement would not apply if the district is able to obtain equivalent
data through other lawful means.  Income data reported by a parent or guardian,
under the bill, would be confidential, and may not be used or shared by the
school district, or by the students school, except for the limited purposes
described in the bill.  Any request for household income data is to be
communicated in a language that the parent or guardian understands, is to
specify the limited purposes for which the reported data may be used, and is to
be submitted either in writing or electronically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would repeal various
sections of existing law, pertaining to school lunch programs, school breakfast
programs, and summer meals programs, which are contrary to the bills
provisions.  Some of the sections being repealed would be replaced by new
sections of the bill.  The sections being repealed, and the provisions replacing
those repealed sections, are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Section 1 of P.L.2006,
c.14 (C.18A:33-3.1).  This section pertains to prepayment for school lunches. 
Because students will no longer be required to pay for school lunches under the
bill, this section is being repealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Section 2 of P.L.1974,
c.53 (C.18A:33-5).  This section exempts, from school lunch requirements, any
school in which less than five percent of enrolled students meet federal
eligibility requirements for receipt of free meals.  Because the bill requires
all schools to provide free school lunches, this section is being repealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Section 3 of P.L.2003,
c.4 (C.18A:33-11).  This section requires a school district to publicize the
availability of the federal School Breakfast Program, to ensure that students
eligible for free or reduced price breakfasts are not treated differently than
other students, and to encourage students who are not eligible for free or
reduced price breakfasts to, nonetheless, participate in the federal School Breakfast
Program.  Because the bill provides that income-eligibility may not be
considered when providing free meals to students, this section is being
repealed, and its publicity provisions are being moved to, and restated in,
other provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Section 3 of P.L.2018,
c.25 (C.18A:33-11.4).  This section provides that the implementation of a
breakfast after the bell program will be subject to the applicable requirements
of section 3 of P.L.2003, c.4 (C.18A:33-11) and section 1 of P.L.2014, c.66
(C.18A:33-11.1), as well as any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
Because the bill is repealing section 3 of P.L.2003, c.4 (C.18A:33-11),
referenced in this provision, and because section 1 of P.L.2014, c.66
(C.18A:33-11.1) does not actually provide any requirements for implementation
of a breakfast after the bell program (and instead, merely encourages schools
to participate in a breakfast after the bell program), this section is being
repealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Section 1 of P.L.2015,
c.15 (C.18A:33-21).  This section provides procedures to be implemented by a
school district, and establishes certain prohibitions on discriminatory
treatment, when a students school breakfast or school lunch bill is in
arrears.  Because students will not be required to pay for school lunch or
breakfast under the bills provisions and the determination of school meal
arrearages will, therefore, not be relevant to whether a student receives
school meals under the bill, this section is being repealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Section 1 of P.L.2020,
c.29 (C.18A:33-21a).  This section established a short title for section 1 of
P.L.2015,&nbsp;c.15&nbsp;(C.18A:33-21)&nbsp;and sections 3 and 4 of P.L.2020,
c.29 (C.18A:33-21b and C.18A:33-21c)  the Hunger-Free Students Bill of
Rights Act.  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>However, the bill is repealing both
section 1 of P.L.2015, c.15 (C.18A:33-21) and section 3 of P.L.2020, c.29
(C.18A:33-21b), cited in this section.  In addition, because the last cited
section  section 4 of P.L.2020, c.29 (C.18A:33-21c)  contains only a single
sentence related to the receipt of school meals by homeless students (not a
more detailed provision establishing a bill of rights for all students), it
no longer seems necessary or appropriate to attach a short title to this sole
remaining provision, particularly when the existing short title does not
reflect the purpose of the remaining provision.  As a result, this short title
section is being repealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Section 3 of P.L.2020,
c.29 (C.18A:33-21b).  This section requires a school district to provide, to a
students parent or guardian, either at the beginning of the school year, or
upon a students initial enrollment, information on the National School Lunch
Program and federal School Breakfast Program, as well as an application to
apply for free and reduced meals under these programs, and information on the
rights that apply under section 1 of P.L.2015, c.15 (C.18A:33-21) and P.L.2020,
c.29 (C.18A:33-21a et al.), regarding school meal arrearages.  Because students
will no longer be required to apply for free school lunches or breakfasts under
the bills provisions, and because the bill is repealing section 1 of P.L.2015,
c.15 (C.18A:33-21) (regarding meal arrearages), this section 3 of P.L.2020,
c.29 (C.18A:33-21b) is also being repealed.  However, it is being replaced with
a new section (section 13 of the bill, to be codified at C.18A:33-21b.1), which
would require school districts to request that a students parent or guardian
complete a household income data collection form for the limited purposes
specified in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   Section 1 of P.L.2017,
c.387 (C.18A:33-23).  This section requires school districts and nonpublic
schools to notify each enrolled student, and the students parent or guardian,
about the availability of, and criteria of eligibility for, the schools summer
meals program and the locations at which summer meals are being made
available.  Because eligibility determinations will not be relevant to a
students receipt of summer meals under the bills provisions, and because
section 1 of P.L.2017, c.387 (C.18A:33-23) despite being the only section of
law that addresses summer meals programs, fails to adequately describe what a
summer meals program is or how it works, this section is being repealed and
replaced with a new section (section 15 of the bill, to be codified at
C.18A:33-23.1), which clarifies the rules applicable to school districts that
provide meals to students through a summer meals program, and which
additionally requires school districts to provide notice to parents and
guardians regarding the availability of summer meals, the locations where such
meals are offered, and the fact that summer meals are offered to students free
of charge.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to the repealers
described above, this bill would also clarify and reorder the provisions of
sections 1 and 2 of P.L.2018, c.28 (C.18A:33-24 an C.18A:33-25), in order to
make it clear that section 1 applies to school districts that are required to
become a sponsor or site under the Summer Food Service Program, while section 2
applies to school districts that elect to become a sponsor or site under the
Summer Food Service Program, despite not being required to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would add a
new central definitions section that incorporates all definitions relevant to
the provision of school meals in the State.  This definitions section would be
applicable to the bills new sections, as well as to the remaining
(un-repealed) provisions of Chapter 33 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes,
which is the chapter of law that addresses the provision of school meals in the
State, and in which the provisions of this bill will be codified.</p>
