Firemens Retirement System and amending P.L.1954, c.84 and P.L.1944, c.255.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 43 of P.L.1954,
c.84 (C.43:15A-43) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43. a. A member who has not
attained age 65 shall, upon the application of the head of the department in
which he is employed or upon his own application or the application of one
acting in his behalf, be retired by the board of trustees, if said employee is
permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event
occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned
duties, on an accidental disability allowance.  A traumatic event occurring
during voluntary performance of regular or assigned duties at a place of
employment before or after required hours of employment which is not in
violation of any valid work rule of the employer or otherwise prohibited by the
employer shall be deemed as occurring during the performance of regular or
assigned duties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The application to accomplish
such retirement must be filed within five years of the original traumatic
event, but the board of trustees may consider an application filed after the
five-year period if it can be factually demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
board of trustees that the disability is due to the accident and the filing was
not accomplished within the five-year period due to a delayed manifestation of
the disability or to circumstances beyond the control of the member. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Permanent and total disability
resulting from a cardiovascular, pulmonary or musculo-skeletal condition which
was not a direct result of a traumatic event occurring in the performance of
duty shall be deemed an ordinary disability. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Before consideration of the
application by the board of trustees, the physician or physicians designated by
the board shall have first made a medical examination of the member at his
residence or at any other place mutually agreed upon and shall have certified to
the board that he is physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance
of duty, and should be retired, and the appointing authority shall have
certified to the board that the member is permanently and totally disabled as a
direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the
performance of his regular or assigned duties, the time and place where the
duty causing the disability was performed, that the disability was not the
result of his willful negligence and that the member should be retired.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No person who becomes a member
of the retirement system on or after the effective date of P.L.2010, c.3 shall
be eligible for retirement pursuant to this section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) For purposes of this
subsection: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Qualifying condition or
impairment of health&quot; includes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     diseases of the upper

rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, vocal cord disease, upper airway
hyper-reactivity and tracheo-bronchitis, or a combination of such conditions;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     diseases of the lower
respiratory tract, including but not limited to bronchitis, asthma, reactive
airway dysfunction syndrome, and different types of pneumonitis, such as
hypersensitivity, granulomatous, or eosinophilic;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     diseases of the
gastroesophageal tract, including esophagitis and reflux disease, either acute
or chronic, caused by exposure or aggravated by exposure;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     diseases of the psychological
axis, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, or any
combination of such conditions;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     diseases of the skin such as
contact dermatitis or burns, either acute or chronic in nature, infectious,
irritant, allergic, idiopathic or non-specific reactive in nature, caused by
exposure or aggravated by exposure; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     new onset diseases resulting
from exposure as such diseases occurring in the future including cancer,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asbestos-related disease, heavy metal
poisoning, musculoskeletal disease and chronic psychological disease.</p>

rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations&quot; means the rescue, recovery, or
cleanup operations at the World Trade Center site between September 11, 2001

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;World Trade Center
site&quot; means any location below a line starting from the Hudson River and
Canal Street, east on Canal Street to Pike Street, south on Pike Street to the
East River, and extending to the lower tip of Manhattan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Notwithstanding any
provision of subsection a. of this section or any other law to the contrary,
for a member who participated, whether or not under orders or instruction by an
employer to so participate, in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup
operations for a minimum of eight hours, permanent and total disability
resulting from a qualifying condition or impairment of health shall be presumed
to have occurred during and as a result of the performance of the member's
regular or assigned duties and not the result of the member's willful
negligence, unless the contrary can be proved by competent evidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A member who did not
participate in such operations for a minimum of eight hours shall be eligible
for the presumption provided that: </p>

five years of the original traumatic event, but the board of trustees may
consider an application filed after the five-year period if it can be factually
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of trustees that the disability
