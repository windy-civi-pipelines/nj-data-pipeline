CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning a presumption for accidental disability retirement in the Public Employees Retirement System and the Police and Firemens Retirement System and amending P.L.1954, c.84 and P.L.1944, c.255. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 43 of P.L.1954, c.84 (C.43:15A-43) is amended to read as follows: 43. a. A member who has not attained age 65 shall, upon the application of the head of the department in which he is employed or upon his own application or the application of one acting in his behalf, be retired by the board of trustees, if said employee is permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties, on an accidental disability allowance.  A traumatic event occurring during voluntary performance of regular or assigned duties at a place of employment before or after required hours of employment which is not in violation of any valid work rule of the employer or otherwise prohibited by the employer shall be deemed as occurring during the performance of regular or assigned duties. The application to accomplish such retirement must be filed within five years of the original traumatic event, but the board of trustees may consider an application filed after the five-year period if it can be factually demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of trustees that the disability is due to the accident and the filing was not accomplished within the five-year period due to a delayed manifestation of the disability or to circumstances beyond the control of the member. Permanent and total disability resulting from a cardiovascular, pulmonary or musculo-skeletal condition which was not a direct result of a traumatic event occurring in the performance of duty shall be deemed an ordinary disability. Before consideration of the application by the board of trustees, the physician or physicians designated by the board shall have first made a medical examination of the member at his residence or at any other place mutually agreed upon and shall have certified to the board that he is physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of duty, and should be retired, and the appointing authority shall have certified to the board that the member is permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties, the time and place where the duty causing the disability was performed, that the disability was not the result of his willful negligence and that the member should be retired. No person who becomes a member of the retirement system on or after the effective date of P.L.2010, c.3 shall be eligible for retirement pursuant to this section. b.

A member who did not participate in such operations for a minimum of eight hours shall be eligible for the presumption provided that: the member participated in the rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations at the World Trade Center site between September 11, 2001 and September 12, 2001; the member sustained a documented physical injury at the World Trade Center site between September 11, 2001 and September 12, 2001 that is a qualifying condition or impairment of health resulting in a disability to the member that prevented the member from continuing to participate in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations for a minimum of eight hours; and the documented physical injury that resulted in a disability to the member that prevented the member from continuing to participate in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations for a minimum of eight hours is the qualifying condition or impairment of health for which the member seeks a presumption under this subsection. In order to be eligible for the presumption provided under this subsection, a member shall have successfully passed a physical examination for entry into public service which failed to disclose evidence of the qualifying condition or impairment of health that formed the basis for the permanent and total disability.

In order to be eligible for the presumption provided under this subsection, a member shall have successfully passed a physical examination prior to enrollment which failed to disclose evidence of Parkinsons disease that formed the basis for the permanent and total disability.  The retirement system shall determine the documents required to prove that the member did not have Parkinsons disease prior to enrollment in the retirement system.

The bill specifies the presumption is created when an emergency medical technician, a firefighter, and a police officer exhibited no evidence of Parkinsons disease at the start of their enrollment in PERS or PFRS.  An emergency medical technician, a firefighter, and a police officer who later exhibits symptoms of the disease has a presumption that the permanent and total disability resulting from the disease was the result of the performance of regular or assigned duties and was not the result of the members willful negligence.

(4)   The board of trustees shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this subsection and shall notify members and retirants in the retirement system of the enactment of this act, P.L.2019, c.157, within 30 days of enactment. A member or retiree shall not be eligible for the presumption or recalculation under this subsection unless within two years of the effective date of this act, P.L.2019, c.157, the member or retiree files a written and sworn statement with the retirement system on a form provided by the board of trustees thereof indicating the dates and locations of service. (5)   This subsection shall apply regardless of whether the member or retiree, who is otherwise eligible, was enrolled in the retirement system at the time of participation in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations as specified herein. c.  Notwithstanding any provision of subsection a. of this section or any other law to the contrary, for a member who has been diagnosed by a medical professional with Parkinsons disease, a permanent and total disability resulting from the disease shall be presumed to have occurred during and as a result of the performance of the members regular or assigned duties and not the result of the members willful negligence, unless the contrary can be proved by competent evidence. In order to be eligible for the presumption provided under this subsection, a member shall have successfully passed a physical examination prior to enrollment which failed to disclose evidence of Parkinsons disease that formed the basis for the permanent and total disability.  The retirement system shall determine the documents required to prove that the member did not have Parkinsons disease prior to enrollment in the retirement system. (cf: P.L.2019, c.157, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill creates a presumption for the accidental disability retirement pension in the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) and the Police and Firemens Retirement System (PFRS) that an emergency medical technician, a firefighter, and a police officer with Parkinsons disease has the disease as a result of their employment. The bill specifies the presumption is created when an emergency medical technician, a firefighter, and a police officer exhibited no evidence of Parkinsons disease at the start of their enrollment in PERS or PFRS.  An emergency medical technician, a firefighter, and a police officer who later exhibits symptoms of the disease has a presumption that the permanent and total disability resulting from the disease was the result of the performance of regular or assigned duties and was not the result of the members willful negligence.
