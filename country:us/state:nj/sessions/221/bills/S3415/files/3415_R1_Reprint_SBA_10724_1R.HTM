<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section) Sections 1
through 20 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited
as the &quot;Energy Infrastructure Public-Private Partnerships Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  (New section) a.  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) It is the public policy of
this State to assure that the State's energy infrastructure is developed and
maintained in a manner that assures, to the greatest extent possible, the
availability of reliable and resilient state-of-the-art energy resources to the
State and, in particular, to the critical facilities that provide necessary lifeline
services to the State's citizens and businesses; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) The recent occurrence of
severe weather events, and the current condition of the State's aging energy
systems underscore the vulnerability of the State's energy infrastructure and
the substantial and immediate need for the State to improve the energy
resources available to State, county, and municipal facilities that provide
critical lifeline services, including hospitals, police and fire departments,
water and wastewater treatment facilities, shelters, colleges, universities,
schools, and prisons;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  The urgent need to
decarbonize the energy sector will require a significant expansion of
intermittent renewable energy sources.  In order to facilitate the expansion of
solar photovoltaic and wind resources, the State's infrastructure must include
dispatchable resources at the location of use in order to mitigate the
significant economic and potential physical damage that could result from poor
power quality issues.  Grid-edge, on-demand energy generation that is efficient
and clean is necessary to support the continued development of renewable
resources; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) The reliability,
resiliency, and efficiency of the State's energy infrastructure will be
improved if the State encourages the development of the energy-related projects
contemplated by P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill), which will reduce the vulnerability of
critical facilities to threats posed by weather and other exogenous factors,
minimize equipment failures caused by deterioration, disrepair, and
obsolescence, enhance the production and delivery of energy, including clean
energy resources, improve the energy efficiency of facilities, reduce peak
demand, energy costs, and greenhouse gas emissions, and promote economic development
and foster job creation; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) The implementation of
energy-related projects through public-private partnerships will enable the
State to leverage the capital and expertise of the private sector, which will
permit needed energy-related projects to be developed, in many instances on a
self-funded basis, without taxpayer or ratepayer support; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) The use of energy
infrastructure public-private partnerships will contribute to the attainment of
the goals of the State's Energy Master Plan, which include aggressive
initiatives to expand the implementation of renewable energy and building and
transportation decarbonization initiatives, improve energy reliability and
resiliency, and introduce state-of-the-art technologies that can make buildings
more energy efficient and reduce energy usage, peak demand, energy costs, and
greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Legislature
therefore determines that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) It shall be the public
policy of this State to foster energy public-private partnerships to develop
state-of-the-art energy-related projects that obviate or minimize the need for
capital investments in such projects by governmental entities, taxpayers, and
utility ratepayers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) In order to foster the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  The Legislature finds
that the steady deterioration of older sewage and sewer systems and wastewater
treatment plants endangers the availability and quality of uncontaminated water
resources of the State, thereby posing a grave danger to the health, safety and
welfare of the residents of the concerned communities and the State; that the
construction, rehabilitation, operation, and maintenance of modern and
efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants are essential to
protecting and improving the State's water quality; that in addition to
protecting and improving water quality, adequate wastewater treatment systems
are essential to economic growth and development; that many of the wastewater
treatment systems in New Jersey must be replaced or upgraded if an inexorable
decline in water quality is to be avoided during the coming decades; that the
United States Congress in recognition of the crucial role wastewater treatment
systems and plants play in maintaining and improving water quality, and with an
understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems must be
borne by local governments and authorities with limited sources of revenues,
established in the &quot;Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972,&quot; Pub.L.92-500 (33 U.S.C. s.1251 et al.) a program to provide local
governments with grants for constructing these systems; that during the last
several years the amount of federal grant money available to states and local
governments for assistance in constructing and improving wastewater treatment
systems has sharply diminished; that the current level of federal grant funding
is inadequate to meet the cost of upgrading the State's wastewater treatment
capacity to comply with State water quality standards; that the collective
needs of the State and local governments for capital financing of wastewater
treatment systems far exceed the sums of money presently available through
revenue initiatives and State and federal aid programs; and that it is fitting
and proper for the State to encourage local governments to undertake wastewater
treatment projects through the establishment of a State mechanism to provide
loans at the lowest reasonable interest rates and to guarantee or insure local
capital improvement bonds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Legislature finds
that stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflows are among the major sources
of ocean pollution, contributing to beach closings; that combined sewer systems
discharge untreated wastewater and stormwater into rivers, streams and coastal
waters during wet weather, resulting in water pollution; that some combined
sewer systems have deteriorated to the point that overflows occur regularly,
even during dry weather; that many sewer systems are on inadequate repair and
replacement programs, which may cause disturbances at sewage treatment plants;
that many municipalities are under building moratoriums due to the inadequacy
of their sewage and stormwater collection systems, which severely affect
municipal budgets; and that large unmet capital expenses exist for combined
sewer system separation and abatement projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
that funding at the federal level for wastewater treatment, stormwater
management and combined sewer system rehabilitation projects is insufficient;
that State funds available for these projects are inadequate to meet current
needs; that local revenues are insufficient to meet these expenses; and that
additional funding at the State level is necessary to meet this financial
obligation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Legislature finds
that construction, rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of modern and
efficient water supply facilities are essential to protecting and improving the
State's water quality; that the citizens of this State, in recognition of the
crucial role the construction of new and the upgrading of existing water supply
facilities play in maintaining and augmenting the natural water resources of
the State, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and
constructing these systems is beyond the limited financial resource
capabilities of local governments and authorities and must be subsidized by the
State and repaid through a system of water supply user charges, approved the
enactment of the &quot;Water Supply Bond Act of 1981&quot; (P.L.1981, c.261);
that the water supply needs of the State are so great that the funds allocated
for this purpose from the &quot;Water Supply Fund&quot; established by that
1981 bond act should be augmented and maximized, to the extent practicable,
through the use of alternative methods of State financing to offset the costs
of water supply projects and for the construction of new or the rehabilitation
of antiquated or inadequate existing water supply facilities; that the United
States Congress in recognition of the essential role that safe drinking water
plays in protecting the public health, and with an understanding that
financing, constructing and maintaining water systems that meet the
requirements of the &quot;Safe Drinking Water Act,&quot; 42 U.S.C. s.300f et
seq. exceed the financial and technical capacity of the operators of some water
systems, has established in the &quot;Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of
1996,&quot; P.L.104-182, a program to provide public water systems with
financial assistance to meet national primary drinking water regulations or to
otherwise further the health protection objectives of the federal law and that
the State must, in order to make use of the federal funds, provide State funds
for the program; and therefore, State funding for the program is necessary to
meet this financial obligation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Legislature finds
that the transportation infrastructure of the State is among the most heavily
used in the nation and has deteriorated in recent years, with parts of the highway
system reaching the end of their useful lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The Legislature finds
that capital projects for roadways and bridges are essential to protecting and
improving the State's transportation system; that construction of new and the
upgrading of existing roadways and bridges play a critical role in the
transportation needs of the State, and with an understanding that the cost of
financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited financial
resource capabilities of local governments and authorities and must be
subsidized by the State and Federal government; that the United States Congress
has established &quot;State Infrastructure Bank&quot; programs to provide
funding for transportation systems (23 U.S.C. s.610) and that the State must,
in order to make use of the federal funds, provide State funds for the program;
and therefore, State funding for the program is necessary to meet this
financial obligation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  <u>The Legislature finds
that energy-related projects are essential to improve the reliability, resiliency,
and efficiency of the energy infrastructure owned or utilized by local
government units, water systems, and various other entities located within the
State, and to reduce energy usage, peak demand, energy costs, and greenhouse
gas emissions.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>g.</u><span

make loans and provide other assistance to certain public-private partnership
