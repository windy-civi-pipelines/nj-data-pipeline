class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning certain forms of discrimination,
including in housing and employment, and amending P.L.1945, c.169.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 3 of P.L.1945,
c.169 (C.10:5-3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  The Legislature finds and
declares that practices of discrimination against any of its inhabitants,
because of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, gender
identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, marital status,
familial status, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United
States, disability <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>or<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>,</u> nationality,
<u>or source of lawful income used for rental or mortgage payments,</u> are
matters of concern to the government of the State, and that such discrimination
threatens not only the rights and proper privileges of the inhabitants of the
State but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic State;
provided, however, that nothing in this expression of policy prevents the
making of legitimate distinctions between citizens and aliens when required by
federal law or otherwise necessary to promote the national interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further
declares its opposition to such practices of discrimination when directed
against any person by reason of the race, creed, color, national origin,
ancestry, age, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual
orientation, marital status, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the
United States, disability <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>or<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>,</u> nationality
<u>, or source of lawful income used for rental or mortgage payments</u> of
that person or that person's family members, partners, members, stockholders,
directors, officers, managers, superintendents, agents, employees, business
associates, suppliers, or customers, in order that the economic prosperity and
general welfare of the inhabitants of the State may be protected and ensured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
that because of discrimination, people suffer personal hardships, and the State
suffers a grievous harm.  The personal hardships include: economic loss; time
loss; physical and emotional stress; and in some cases severe emotional trauma,
illness, homelessness or other irreparable harm resulting from the strain of employment
controversies; relocation, search and moving difficulties; anxiety caused by
lack of information, uncertainty, and resultant planning difficulty; career,
education, family and social disruption; and adjustment problems, which
particularly impact on those protected by this act.  Such harms have, under the
common law, given rise to legal remedies, including compensatory and punitive
damages.  The Legislature intends that such damages be available to all persons
protected by this act and that this act shall be liberally construed in
combination with other protections available under the laws of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2019, c.436, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  Section 5 of P.L.1945,
c.169 (C.10:5-5) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.  As used in P.L.1945, c.169
(C.10:5-1 et seq.), unless a different meaning clearly appears from the
context:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  &quot;Person&quot;
includes one or more individuals, partnerships, associations, organizations,
labor organizations, corporations, legal representatives, trustees, trustees in
bankruptcy, receivers, and fiduciaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  &quot;Employment
agency&quot; includes any person undertaking to procure employees or
opportunities for others to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  &quot;Labor
organization&quot; includes any organization which exists and is constituted
for the purpose, in whole or in part, of collective bargaining, or of dealing
with employers concerning grievances, terms or conditions of employment, or of
other mutual aid or protection in connection with employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  &quot;Unlawful employment
practice&quot; and &quot;unlawful discrimination&quot; include only those
unlawful practices and acts specified in section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169
(C.10:5-12).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  &quot;Employer&quot;
includes all persons as defined in subsection a. of this section and
&quot;hiring entities&quot; as defined by section 2 of P.L.2023, c.262

civil subdivision thereof, and all public officers, agencies, boards, or
bodies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.2023, c.262)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  &quot;Liability for
service in the Armed Forces of the United States&quot; means subject to being
ordered as an individual or member of an organized unit into active service in
the Armed Forces of the United States by reason of membership in the National
Guard, naval militia or a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United
States, or subject to being inducted into such armed forces through a system of
national selective service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  &quot;Division&quot; means

condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver,
or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to
make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the

rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work
schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for
needs related to the pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of <b><span

demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the
business operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way
penalize the employee in terms, conditions or privileges of employment for
requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided
pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee
affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less
favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected
by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to
work.  This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or
decreasing any employee's rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in
connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>

childbirth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship
on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered
include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number
of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of
the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the
employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking
into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside
funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an
essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business
necessity requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     t.     For an employer to pay
any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of
compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the
employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for
substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and
responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation
of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in
order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of
compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made
pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  That the differential is
based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the
characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education
or experience, or the quantity or quality of production;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  That the factor or
factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation
based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  That each of the factors
is applied reasonably;</p>

factors account for the entire wage differential; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  That the factors are

business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it

the same business purpose without producing the wage differential.</p>

shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. 
For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;member of a protected class&quot;

color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union
status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic
information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or
atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or liability for
service in the armed forces, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the &quot;Law
Against Discrimination,&quot; P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) (LAD), to make
existing provisions consistent, where appropriate, in prohibiting
discrimination based on the source of a persons lawful income.  Although
currently prohibited by the LAD, this form of discrimination is not articulated
consistently throughout this existing statute.  This bill clarifies the LADs
prohibition on discrimination based on the source of a persons lawful income
by defining the term source of lawful income and expressly stating that the
prohibition applies to the income that would be used for either rental or
mortgage payments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also adjusts current
law to provide that it does not constitute unlawful employment practice to
require, in certain instances, the retirement of an employee if the employee is
entitled to an immediate retirement benefit of at least $44,000.  The bill
increases this limit from $27,000, and removes a provision that expressly
permits an employer to restrict employment to United States citizens when the
restriction is required by federal law or necessary to protect national
security. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also makes certain
adjustments to current law to make the language gender neutral, and makes
certain technical changes.   </p>

immediately.</p>
