eligibility for various veterans benefits by eliminating the requirement that
to be considered a veteran a person must have served during periods of war, in
specific war zones, or during periods of emergency.  Instead, the bill provides
that a person will be considered a veteran if he or she served for at least 90
days, exclusive of certain types of initial training, in order to be eligible
for  veterans benefits.  The bill specifies that to be considered a veteran and
eligible for veterans benefits, a member of a reserve component of the United
States Armed Forces (including the National Guard) must serve the entire period
to which he or she is called to federal active service, exclusive of active
duty for training.  A person who is discharged as the result of a
service-connected disability will be classed as a veteran even if he or she did
not meet the 90-day service requirement.</p>

allowance under the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF) or the Public
Employees' Retirement System (PERS);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the purchase of
additional military service credit in the Police and Firemen's Retirement
System (PFRS), TPAF and PERS;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   the annual  property tax
deduction provided under Article VIII of the New Jersey Constitution ($250 each
tax year) or the property tax exemption provided under N.J.S.A.54:4-3.30 for a
veteran who is certified permanently 100% disabled by the United States

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Eligibility for the property
tax benefits and civil service preference is contingent upon voter approval of

paragraph 2 (concerning civil service preference) of the State Constitution
currently refer to service in time of war.</p>
