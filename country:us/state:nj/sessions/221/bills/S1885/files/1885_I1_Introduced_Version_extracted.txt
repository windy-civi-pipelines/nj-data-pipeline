Instead of the certificate of honorable discharge or release under honorable circumstances required to be provided to the Adjutant General of the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs pursuant to N.J.S.11A:5-1, the claimant shall provide to the Adjutant General, in a form and content the Adjutant General shall deem appropriate, evidence of his or her status as an active service member of the Armed Forces of the United States or as a member of a reserve component thereof. 18.     (New section) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a resident of this State who is in active service in the Armed Forces of the United States or is a member of a reserve component thereof, and has not been discharged or released therefrom, but who otherwise qualifies as a veteran, shall be eligible for a veterans' deduction on the same basis as a veteran.  Instead of the certificate of honorable discharge or release under honorable circumstances required to be provided to the assessor pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1963, c.171 (C.54:4-8.12), the claimant shall provide to the assessor, in a form and content the Adjutant General shall deem appropriate, evidence of his or her status as an active service member of the Armed Forces of the United States or as a member of a reserve component thereof. 19.     N.J.S.11A:5-13, section 3 of P.L.2001, c.128 (C.43:15A-24b) and section 1 of P.L.1983, c.391 (C.43:16A-11.7) are repealed. 20.     Section 2 of P.L.1971, c.398 (C.54:4-3.33a) is repealed. 21.     This act shall take effect immediately, but sections 1 through 3 shall take effect on the 1st day of the calendar year following approval by the voters of an authorizing amendment to Article VII, Section I, paragraph 2 of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey and sections 10 through 16, section 18 and section 20 shall take effect on the 1st day of the tax year following approval by the voters of an authorizing amendment to Article VIII, Section I, paragraph 3 of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey. STATEMENT This bill broadens the eligibility for various veterans benefits by eliminating the requirement that to be considered a veteran a person must have served during periods of war, in specific war zones, or during periods of emergency.  Instead, the bill provides that a person will be considered a veteran if he or she served for at least 90 days, exclusive of certain types of initial training, in order to be eligible for  veterans benefits.  The bill specifies that to be considered a veteran and eligible for veterans benefits, a member of a reserve component of the United States Armed Forces (including the National Guard) must serve the entire period to which he or she is called to federal active service, exclusive of active duty for training.  A person who is discharged as the result of a service-connected disability will be classed as a veteran even if he or she did not meet the 90-day service requirement. The veterans benefits include: (1)   civil service preference under Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes; (2)   veteran's retirement allowance under the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF) or the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS); (3)   the purchase of additional military service credit in the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), TPAF and PERS; (4)   the annual  property tax deduction provided under Article VIII of the New Jersey Constitution ($250 each tax year) or the property tax exemption provided under N.J.S.A.54:4-3.30 for a veteran who is certified permanently 100% disabled by the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs; and (5)   surviving spouse benefits for veterans killed in active service, including civil service preference and the property tax deduction or exemption. The bill provides that an active service member of the United States Armed Forces or a current member of a military reserve component (including the National Guard) who has not been discharged from service is eligible for the civil service preference and the property tax deduction provided that he or she qualifies as a veteran. Eligibility for the property tax benefits and civil service preference is contingent upon voter approval of authorizing amendments to the State Constitution.  Article VIII, Section I, paragraph 3 (concerning property tax benefits) and Article VII, Section I, paragraph 2 (concerning civil service preference) of the State Constitution currently refer to service in time of war. The bill repeals a section of existing civil service, pension and tax law regarding wartime service which is no longer necessary because of the elimination of the wartime service requirement.

[The] If the application [, if] is not filed with the assessor [within the time aforementioned,] on or before December 31 of the pretax year, it may be filed with the collector during the tax year [and upon approval by] for review.  If the collector [of such] approves the application he or she shall determine the amount of the reduction in tax to which the claimant is entitled and shall allow said amount as an offset against the tax then remaining unpaid.  If the amount allowable as an offset [shall exceed] exceeds the amount of the tax then unpaid for that tax year, or if the application for a veteran's deduction is not filed with the collector until after all taxes for the tax year have been fully paid, the claimant may make application to the governing body of the municipality constituting the taxing district for the refund of any tax overpaid, but without interest, and the governing body may, in its discretion, direct the return of any tax [deemed by it] it deems to have been overpaid by reason of claimant's failure to make timely application for a veteran's deduction; provided, however, that an assessor, collector or governing body shall not allow an [no] application for a veteran's deduction for any previous tax year [shall be allowed by any assessor, collector or governing body]. Where an application for a veteran's deduction is filed with and allowed by a collector [he], the collector shall promptly transmit such application and all exhibits attached thereto, or a [photostatic] copy thereof, to the assessor of the taxing district.  Upon receipt thereof the assessor shall review the application and if approved by [him] the assessor it shall have the same force as if originally filed with him or her. (cf: P.L.1985, c.515, s.9) 16.  Section 8 of P.L.1963, c.171 (C.54:4-8.17) is amended to read as follows: 8.    No person shall be allowed a veteran's deduction from the tax assessed against real [and personal] property of more than $100 in the aggregate in tax year 2000, $150 in the aggregate in tax year 2001, $200 in the aggregate in tax year 2002 and $250 in the aggregate in any subsequent tax year, but a veteran's deduction may be claimed in any taxing district in which the claimant has taxable property and may be apportioned, at the claimant's option, between two or more taxing districts; provided such claims shall not exceed $100 in the aggregate in tax year 2000, $150 in the aggregate in tax year 2001, $200 in the aggregate in tax year 2002 and $250 in the aggregate in any subsequent tax year.  If a surviving spouse [, as herein defined, shall have been honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances from active service in time of war in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States,] is also a veteran, the surviving spouse shall be entitled to a veteran's deduction for each status. The veteran's deductions herein provided shall be in addition to any exemptions now or hereafter provided by any other statute for disabled veterans or surviving spouses [, as herein defined,] and in addition to any deductions provided under P.L.1963, c.172 (C.54:4-8.40 et seq.) for senior citizens and the permanently and totally disabled, and certain surviving spouses thereof, to which the claimant is entitled. In addition, a claimant may receive any homestead rebate or credit provided by law. (cf: P.L.2000, c.9, s.2) 17.     (New section) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a resident of this State who is in active service in the Armed Forces of the United States or is a member of a reserve component thereof, and has not been discharged or released therefrom, but who otherwise qualifies as a veteran, shall be eligible for a civil service preference on the same basis as a veteran. Instead of the certificate of honorable discharge or release under honorable circumstances required to be provided to the Adjutant General of the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs pursuant to N.J.S.11A:5-1, the claimant shall provide to the Adjutant General, in a form and content the Adjutant General shall deem appropriate, evidence of his or her status as an active service member of the Armed Forces of the United States or as a member of a reserve component thereof. 18.     (New section) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a resident of this State who is in active service in the Armed Forces of the United States or is a member of a reserve component thereof, and has not been discharged or released therefrom, but who otherwise qualifies as a veteran, shall be eligible for a veterans' deduction on the same basis as a veteran.  Instead of the certificate of honorable discharge or release under honorable circumstances required to be provided to the assessor pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1963, c.171 (C.54:4-8.12), the claimant shall provide to the assessor, in a form and content the Adjutant General shall deem appropriate, evidence of his or her status as an active service member of the Armed Forces of the United States or as a member of a reserve component thereof. 19.     N.J.S.11A:5-13, section 3 of P.L.2001, c.128 (C.43:15A-24b) and section 1 of P.L.1983, c.391 (C.43:16A-11.7) are repealed. 20.     Section 2 of P.L.1971, c.398 (C.54:4-3.33a) is repealed. 21.     This act shall take effect immediately, but sections 1 through 3 shall take effect on the 1st day of the calendar year following approval by the voters of an authorizing amendment to Article VII, Section I, paragraph 2 of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey and sections 10 through 16, section 18 and section 20 shall take effect on the 1st day of the tax year following approval by the voters of an authorizing amendment to Article VIII, Section I, paragraph 3 of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey. STATEMENT This bill broadens the eligibility for various veterans benefits by eliminating the requirement that to be considered a veteran a person must have served during periods of war, in specific war zones, or during periods of emergency.  Instead, the bill provides that a person will be considered a veteran if he or she served for at least 90 days, exclusive of certain types of initial training, in order to be eligible for  veterans benefits.  The bill specifies that to be considered a veteran and eligible for veterans benefits, a member of a reserve component of the United States Armed Forces (including the National Guard) must serve the entire period to which he or she is called to federal active service, exclusive of active duty for training.  A person who is discharged as the result of a service-connected disability will be classed as a veteran even if he or she did not meet the 90-day service requirement. The veterans benefits include: (1)   civil service preference under Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes; (2)   veteran's retirement allowance under the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF) or the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS); (3)   the purchase of additional military service credit in the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), TPAF and PERS; (4)   the annual  property tax deduction provided under Article VIII of the New Jersey Constitution ($250 each tax year) or the property tax exemption provided under N.J.S.A.54:4-3.30 for a veteran who is certified permanently 100% disabled by the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs; and (5)   surviving spouse benefits for veterans killed in active service, including civil service preference and the property tax deduction or exemption. The bill provides that an active service member of the United States Armed Forces or a current member of a military reserve component (including the National Guard) who has not been discharged from service is eligible for the civil service preference and the property tax deduction provided that he or she qualifies as a veteran. Eligibility for the property tax benefits and civil service preference is contingent upon voter approval of authorizing amendments to the State Constitution.  Article VIII, Section I, paragraph 3 (concerning property tax benefits) and Article VII, Section I, paragraph 2 (concerning civil service preference) of the State Constitution currently refer to service in time of war. The bill repeals a section of existing civil service, pension and tax law regarding wartime service which is no longer necessary because of the elimination of the wartime service requirement.
