misdemeanor and, upon conviction, may be fined not more than one thousand

addition shall forfeit his office.</p>

liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that
occurred while cooperating with federal immigration authorities pursuant to
P.L.     , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill),

shall comply  with  the following provisions:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     No local government

officer or employee shall act in his official capacity in any matter where he,
a member of his immediate family, or a business organization in which he has an
interest, has a direct or indirect financial or personal involvement that might
reasonably be expected to impair his objectivity or independence of judgment;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     No local government
officer or employee shall undertake any employment or service, whether
compensated or not, which might reasonably be expected to prejudice his
independence of judgment in the exercise of his official duties;  </p>

officer or employee, member of his immediate family, or business organization
in which he has an interest, shall solicit or accept any gift, favor, loan,
political contribution, service, promise of future employment, or other thing
of value based upon an understanding that the gift, favor, loan, contribution,
service, promise, or other thing of value was given or offered for the purpose
of influencing him, directly or indirectly, in the discharge of his official
duties.  This provision shall not apply to the solicitation or acceptance of
contributions to the campaign of an announced candidate for elective public
office, if the local government officer has no knowledge or reason to believe
that the campaign contribution, if accepted, was given with the intent to
influence the local government officer in the discharge of his official
duties;  </p>

officer or employee shall use, or allow to be used, his public office or
employment, or any information, not generally available to the members of the
public, which he receives or acquires in the course of and by reason of his
office or employment, for the purpose of securing financial gain for himself,

hereinafter set forth, shall within six months from the date of enactment,

the Legislature, the State officers and employees or the special State officers

conform to the general standards hereinafter set forth in this section, but it
shall be formulated with respect to the particular needs and problems of the agency
to which said code is to apply and, when applicable, shall be a supplement to
the uniform ethics code promulgated pursuant to paragraph (2) of this
subsection. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the New

the general standards hereinafter set forth in this section, shall be the
primary code of ethics for State agencies once it is adopted and a code

to the primary code.  The head of each State agency, or the principal officer
in charge of a division, board, bureau, commission or other instrumentality

business, profession, trade or occupation which is subject to licensing or
regulation by a specific agency of State Government without promptly filing
notice of such activity with the State Ethics Commission, if he is an officer
or employee in the Executive Branch, or with the Joint Legislative Committee on
Ethical Standards, if he is an officer or employee in the Legislative Branch.</p>

employee or special State officer or employee should use or attempt to use his
official position to secure unwarranted privileges or advantages for himself or
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   No State officer or
employee or special State officer or employee should act in his official
capacity in any matter wherein he has a direct or indirect personal financial
interest that might reasonably be expected to impair his objectivity or independence
of judgment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   No State officer or
employee or special State officer or employee should undertake any employment
or service, whether compensated or not, which might reasonably be expected to
impair his objectivity and independence of judgment in the exercise of his
official duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   No State officer or
employee or special State officer or employee should accept any gift, favor,
service or other thing of value under circumstances from which it might be
reasonably inferred that such gift, service or other thing of value was given
or offered for the purpose of influencing him in the discharge of his official
duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   <u>(i)</u> No State
officer or employee or special State officer or employee should knowingly act
in any way that might reasonably be expected to create an impression or
suspicion among the public having knowledge of his acts that he may be engaged
in conduct violative of his trust as a State officer or employee or special
State officer or employee.</p>

government; that citizens who are government officials and employees have a
right to private interests of a personal, financial and economic nature; that
standards of conduct should separate those conflicts of interest which are
unavoidable in a free society from those conflicts of interest which are
substantial and material, or which bring government into disrepute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is intended to make
certain that State and local officials in New Jersey cooperate with federal
authorities with respect to immigration and customs enforcement requests.  The
bill prohibits counties and municipalities from establishing formal or informal
policies of non-cooperation with federal immigration authorities.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Several jurisdictions, such as
California, have established a formal prohibition on cooperation with federal
authorities on immigration issues.  In San Francisco, a young woman named Kate
Steinle was brutally murdered by an individual who intentionally committed the
crime in San Francisco because it had designated itself a sanctuary city.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Other jurisdictions, such as
certain municipalities in New Jersey, have an informal practice of not
cooperating with requests from the federal government regarding immigration
matters.  This bill is intended to prevent the State, municipalities, or any
subdivision thereof, from establishing a formal or informal sanctuary city
policy, which has led to recent violent crimes around the country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, a State or
local official who fails to cooperate with federal authorities with respect to
immigration enforcement will be committing an ethics violation.  The regular
process for the disposition of ethics violations at the State or local level
will be applicable to these situations.  The bill also creates a civil fine for
any member of a municipal or county governing body which votes in favor of a
sanctuary city ordinance after the effective date of the bill. </p>
