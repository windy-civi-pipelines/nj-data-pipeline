empowered to anticipate this amount for the purposes of preparing its annual
budget.  For the purposes of calculating the payments, the owner or operator of
the sanitary landfill facility may, subject to the prior agreement of the
relevant municipality and the approval of the Department of Environmental
Protection, provide the municipality with any of the following benefits in
consideration for the use of land within its municipal boundaries as the
location of a sanitary landfill facility:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The receipt of annual
sums of money in lieu of taxes on the land used for the sanitary landfill

of a sanitary landfill facility required to make annual payments to a
municipality pursuant to subsection a. of this section may petition the
Department of Environmental Protection for an increase in its tariff which
reflects these payments. The department, <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>within<b><span

more than 180 days after being commenced.  If negotiations cannot be completed

apply to the department for an extension of up to 180 days to complete the
negotiations.  The joint application shall identify the reasons why
negotiations were not completed within the initial 180-day timeframe required
by this subsection.  The department shall approve an application for extension,
submitted pursuant to this subsection, provided that there is no reasonable
basis for the commissioner to believe that the municipality or sanitary
landfill facility are acting in bad faith with respect to the negotiations. 
Notice of an extension authorized pursuant to this subsection shall be posted

10 days after the extension is granted. </u></p>

website and provide a minimum 45-day period for public comment on the proposed
agreement.  Not more than 45 days after the public comment period is closed,
the municipality and sanitary landfill facility shall consider the comments
received and incorporate changes to the proposed host community benefit
agreement, in accordance with those comments, as is deemed by the parties to be
appropriate.  Upon submission of the proposed agreement to the department for
approval, pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the municipality shall
also transmit the public comments to the department for consideration.</u>  </p>

the department on the basis of bad faith negotiations undertaken by either
party, or if the parties otherwise cannot agree on the terms of the host
community benefit agreement within the initial and extended timeframes provided
by subsection f. of this section, the department shall issue an order
establishing a host community benefit in the municipality, as the commissioner
deems appropriate.  When establishing the host community benefit, the
commissioner shall consider, and shall incorporate to the greatest extent
possible, consistent with the other provisions of the order, any terms on which
the parties were able to reach agreement during the course of negotiations.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend the law
pertaining to the establishment of host community benefit agreements for
municipalities in which sanitary landfill facilities or solid waste transfer
stations operate, in order to provide for greater public input with respect to
the establishment and terms of such agreements and greater transparency and
finality in the host community benefit negotiation process.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law provides that any
municipality in which a sanitary landfill facility or transfer station is
located is entitled to receive an annual economic benefit, to be paid by the
owner or operator of the facility or transfer station.  The amount and form of
the benefit are to be established pursuant to an agreement that is executed
between the municipality and the sanitary landfill facility or transfer station
and is approved by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or the
Board of Public Utilities (BPU), as appropriate.  This bill would:  (1)
establish a specific timeframe for the completion of host community benefit
negotiations between a municipality and a sanitary landfill facility or
transfer station; (2) require the municipality to publish the proposed
agreement online, for public comment, prior to submitting the proposed
agreement to the DEP or BPU for approval; (3) require the DEP or BPU to
establish the host community benefit for a municipality in any case where the
parties are negotiating in bad faith or otherwise fail to come to an agreement
on the host community benefit; and (4) authorize any resident to petition the
DEP or BPU for an order establishing or adjusting a host community benefit in
the municipality.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides, in
particular, that, not more than 10 days after negotiations are commenced
between a municipality and a sanitary landfill facility or transfer station to
establish a host community benefit, the municipality will be required to
provide written notice to the DEP or BPU, as appropriate, indicating the date
on which negotiations were commenced.  Negotiations are to be completed not
more than 180 days after being commenced; however, if negotiations cannot be
completed within this timeframe, the parties may jointly apply to the DEP or
BPU for an extension of up to 180 days to complete the negotiations and publish
the proposed agreement.  An application for extension is to identify the
reasons why negotiations were not completed within the initial 180-day
timeframe required by the bill.  The DEP or BPU, as appropriate, will be
required to approve an application for extension, so long as there is no
reasonable basis for the commissioner or the board, as appropriate, to believe
that the municipality or the sanitary landfill facility or transfer station, as
appropriate, are acting in bad faith with respect to the negotiations.  Notice
of an extension authorized under the bill is to be posted on the Internet
websites of both the municipality and the DEP or BPU, as appropriate, within 10
days after the extension is granted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that, not
more than 10 days after negotiations are completed in accordance with the timeframes
specified by the bill, and before the proposed host community benefit agreement
is submitted to the DEP or BPU for approval, the municipality is to publish the
proposed host community benefit agreement on its Internet website and provide a
minimum 45-day period for public comment on the proposed agreement.  Not more
than 45 days after the public comment period is closed, the parties will be
required to consider the comments received and incorporate changes to the
proposed host community benefit agreement, in accordance with those comments,
as is deemed by the parties to be appropriate.  Upon submission of the proposed
agreement to the DEP or BPU for approval, the municipality will also be
required to transmit the public comments to the DEP or BPU for consideration.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If an application for
extension of the negotiation period is denied by the DEP or the BPU on the
basis of bad faith negotiations undertaken by either party, or if the parties
otherwise cannot agree on the terms of the host community benefit agreement
within the initial and extended timeframes specified by the bill, the DEP or
BPU, as appropriate, will be required to issue an order establishing a host
community benefit in the municipality as the commissioner or board deems
appropriate.  When establishing a host community benefit, the commissioner or
board will be required to consider, and incorporate to the greatest extent
possible, consistent with the other provisions of the order, any terms on which
the parties were able to reach agreement during the course of negotiations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill authorizes
any resident of a municipality in which a sanitary landfill facility or
transfer station is located to, at any time, petition the DEP or the BPU for an
order establishing or adjusting a host community benefit in the municipality.  Any
such petition is to:  (1) indicate the level of benefit that the petitioner
believes should be imposed; (2) include supporting information and
documentation explaining why the proposed level of benefit is both reasonable
and necessary; and (3) include any other information required by the DEP or
BPU, as appropriate.  The DEP or BPU, as the case may be, will be required to issue
a decision on the petition no later than 180 days after receipt thereof.  </p>
