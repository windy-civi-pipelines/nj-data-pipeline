STATEMENT This joint resolution designates May 30 of each year as Stigma Free Mental Health Awareness Day in New Jersey to increase awareness surrounding the negative impact of mental health stigma, normalize conversations about mental health, and encourage those living with diagnosable mental health conditions to seek help. Diagnosable mental health conditions can affect an individuals psychological, emotional, and social well-being and ability to perform major life activities.  In 2022, approximately 28 percent of adults in the United States and 21 percent of adults in New Jersey reported having an unmet need for mental health treatment.  Many individuals with unmet mental health needs cite shame and stigma as major barriers to accessing treatment.  Over time, internalized feelings of shame and stigma surrounding ones mental health can lead to feelings of hopelessness and suicidal thoughts or actions. Due to the serious adverse effects of mental health stigma, stigma-reduction is a public health priority in New Jersey.  As research demonstrates increasing awareness and having regular conversations regarding mental health can help destigmatize mental health and empower those in need to seek treatment, May 30 of each year shall be designated as Stigma Free Mental Health Awareness Day in New Jersey.  The Governor is requested to issue a proclamation annually to recognize Stigma Free Mental Health Awareness Day and call upon relevant State agencies, organizations, and citizens of the State to participate in appropriate awareness activities and initiatives.
