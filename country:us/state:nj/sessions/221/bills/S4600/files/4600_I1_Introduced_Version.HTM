<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 1 of P.L.2021,
c.40 (C.19:15A-1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. a. In addition to all other
forms of voting provided for by this Title, a registered voter shall be
permitted to vote at a specially designated polling place before the day of
certain primary and general elections in this State.  This procedure shall be known
as early voting.  The early voting period shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   start on the seventh
calendar day before a non-presidential primary election for a non-presidential
general election and end on the second calendar day before that
non-presidential primary election;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   start on the seventh
calendar day before a presidential primary election for a presidential general
election and end on the second calendar day before that presidential primary
election; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   start on the 10th
calendar day before a general election and end on the second calendar day
before that general election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The voting process during the
early voting period shall be conducted using electronic poll books and
optical-scan voting machines that read hand-marked paper ballots or other
voting machines that produce a voter-verifiable paper ballot.  Any municipality
conducting regular municipal elections in May pursuant to the provisions of the
&quot;Uniform Nonpartisan Elections Law,&quot; P.L.1981, c.379 (C.40:45-5 et
seq.), may, by an ordinance adopted by its governing body, also conduct early
voting for the regular municipal election, in accordance with the provisions of
this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1 et al.).  If adopted by a municipal
governing body, the early voting period for a regular municipal election in May
shall start on the 4th calendar day before the regular municipal election and
end on the second calendar day before that regular municipal election.  An
early voting period shall only be permitted for a non-presidential or
presidential primary election and a general election in this State and, if
adopted by a municipal governing body, a regular municipal election conducted
in May.  Pursuant to the provisions of this act and Title 19 of the Revised
Statutes and in accordance with procedures that may be established by the
Secretary of State for verifying eligible voters, each county board of
elections shall verify that a registered voter is qualified to vote in the
election and shall prescribe the manner by which a registered voter may vote
during such period.  <u>Mail-in voters wishing to vote in person during the
early voting period shall comply with the requirements of chapter 63 of Title
19 of the Revised Statutes.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) For the primary and the
general election, each county board of elections shall designate at least
three, but not more than five, public locations within each county as the sites
for early voting to occur, except that the county board shall designate at
least five, but not more than seven, public locations for early voting if the
number of registered voters in the county is at least 150,000 but less than
300,000, and shall designate at least seven, but not more than 10, public
locations for early voting if the number of registered voters in the county is
300,000 or more.  This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent county
boards of elections, at their discretion, from establishing additional
locations in excess of the five, seven, or 10 location limits respectively set
forth herein; provided, however, that the State shall be required to provide
reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and including the five, seven,
or 10 respective limits established herein, and shall not be required to
provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond those limits under
section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  The number of registered
voters in each county shall be determined ahead of the selection of early
voting sites pursuant to a uniform standard which shall be developed by the
Secretary of State through the rulemaking process pursuant to the
&quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et
seq.).  Whenever possible, early voting locations shall be geographically
located so as to ensure both access in the part of the county that features the
greatest concentration of population, according to the most recent federal
decennial census of the United States, and access in various geographic areas
of the county.  All early voting locations shall be public facilities, such as
county courthouses, public libraries and the offices of the municipal clerk,
county clerk, and county board of elections, or places of public accommodation
as provided under Title 10 of the Revised Statutes.  No public school building
and no building used as a public school, as that term is defined under
N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall, however, be designated as an early voting location.  The
locations shall be designated at the same time as all other polling places are
designated by the board of elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members
of the county board with respect to the selection of sites for early voting,
the county clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are
designated in each county, county boards of election shall evaluate and, if
deemed necessary, revise these locations in order to accommodate significant
changes in the number of registered voters within each county, reflect the
population distribution and density within each county, or because of similar
circumstances.  The Secretary of State may develop the criteria to be used by
county boards of election to revise the location of early voting sites and
shall prescribe how often such revision shall take place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A voter shall be permitted to
vote at any early voting site in the voter's county.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Whenever a municipality
that conducts regular municipal elections in May chooses to participate in
early voting for the regular municipal election, the county board of elections
shall designate at least one public location, but not more than three public
locations, within the municipality as the site or sites for early voting to
occur.  This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent a county board of
elections, at its discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess
of the three location limit set forth herein; provided, however, that the State
shall be required to provide reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and
including the three location limit established herein, and shall not be
required to provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond that limit
under section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  Whenever possible,
each such location shall be geographically located in the part of the
municipality that features the greatest concentration of population, according
to the most recent federal decennial census of the United States.  All early
voting locations shall be public facilities, such as municipal courthouses and
the offices of the municipal clerk, or places of public accommodation as
provided under Title 10 of the Revised Statutes.  No public school building and
no building used as a public school, as that term is defined under
N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall be designated as an early voting location.  The locations
shall be designated at the same time as all other polling places are designated
by the board of elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members of the
county board with respect to the selection of sites for early voting, the
municipal clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are
designated in each municipality, county boards of election shall evaluate and,
if deemed necessary, revise these locations in order to accommodate significant
changes in the number of registered voters within each municipality, reflect
the population distribution and density within each municipality, or because of
similar circumstances.  The Secretary of State may develop the criteria to be
used by county boards of election to revise the location of early voting sites
and shall prescribe how often such revision shall take place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A voter shall be permitted to
vote at any early voting site in the voter's municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Each early voting site
in a county or municipality shall be open for early voting on Monday through
Saturday from at least 10 AM to 8 PM, and on Sunday from at least 10 AM to 6
PM.  Any voter who is on line at the time scheduled for the closing of an early
voting site shall be permitted to vote.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The election officers
responsible for conducting early voting shall be the same as those responsible
for conducting a primary and a general election, as appropriate, pursuant to
this Title.  The number of such officers and their hours of service shall be as
determined by each county board of elections.  The compensation for such
officers shall be the same as provided to district board of election members
serving at a school election pursuant to R.S.19:45-6, or that required pursuant
to Article I, paragraph 23 of the New Jersey Constitution, whichever is
greater.</p>

governing the conduct of voters at a polling place on the days that early
voting occurs, the procedures governing who is permitted in a polling place on
such occasions and the prohibition on electioneering within 100 feet of a
polling place during an election, shall be as provided in chapters 15, 34, 50
and 52 of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes and every other applicable section
of this Title.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     In real time using the
electronic poll books each day during the early voting period, and prior to the
start of each regularly scheduled primary and general election, and regular
municipal election in each non-partisan municipality choosing to participate in
early voting, each county board shall make such changes as may be necessary to
the voter's record in the Statewide voter registration system to indicate that
a voter has voted in that election using the early voting procedure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g. (1) Each county board shall
be responsible for forming and executing a written plan to ensure, to the
greatest extent possible, the integrity of the voting process and the security
of ballots used during the early voting period, including the security of
voting machines, voted ballots, and election records.  The plan shall be based
on guidelines established by the Secretary of State and shall be submitted thereto
no later than December 15 of each year.  The Secretary of State shall review
and, if deemed necessary thereby, require changes to a plan no later than
February 1 of each year.  Each plan shall specify a chain of custody and
security plan for the voting machines, and a chain of custody for the voted
ballots and election records and materials, and shall require, among other
specifications deemed necessary by the Secretary of State and county boards of
election, that all voted ballots shall be transferred at the end of each early
voting day to county boards of election for safekeeping.  After the voted
ballots are transferred to the county board of elections at the end of each
early voting day, a county board may elect to impound those voted ballots on a
secure server, or by any other means deemed appropriate by the Secretary of
State.  The voted ballots shall not be canvassed until the closing of the polls
on election day as required pursuant to section 4 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40
(C.19:15A-4).  The results of the voted ballots cast during early voting shall
remain confidential and shall be disclosed only in accordance with the
provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, regulations, and guidelines
concerning the disclosure of election results, and a violation shall be subject
to the penalties established by law.</p>

provisions of this subsection, in the year in which P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1
et al.) becomes law, each county board shall submit its plan to the Secretary
of State within 30 days following the effective date of this act and the
Secretary of State shall review it and, if deemed necessary thereby, require
changes in the plan within 45 days following the effective date of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Each county board shall
make certain that each polling place used for early voting shall be accessible
to individuals with disabilities and the elderly, in compliance with the
&quot;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990&quot; (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et
seq.), and that each polling place provides such voters, including the blind
and visually impaired, the same opportunity for access and participation,
including privacy and independence, as other voters in compliance with the
&quot;Help America Vote Act of 2002&quot; (42 U.S.C. s.15481).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The Secretary of State

any electronic poll books provided by section 1 of P.L.2019, c.80
(C.19:31-35).  Each polling place used for early voting shall have a computer,
tablet, or other electronic device to print provisional ballots for voters
required to vote by provisional ballot in accordance with the provisions of
Title 19 of the Revised Statutes or due to an equipment malfunction as further
provided under section 3 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-37), or any other election
related material, if needed.  A computer, tablet, or other electronic device
and the printer used to print election materials at a polling place shall not
be used unless it has been certified by the Secretary of State.  The Secretary
of State shall adopt and publish standards and regulations governing the
certification and use of computer, tablets, or other electronic devices and
printers to print election materials at each polling place used for early
voting.  The Secretary of State shall not certify a computer, tablet, or other
electronic device or printer unless it is in compliance with the secretary's
standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     Each polling place used

election, or as provided under subsection b. of this section, each county board
of elections shall open in the presence of the commissioner of registration, or
the designee thereof, the inner envelopes that contain the mail-in ballots with
the votes cast for the election.  The inner envelopes containing the ballots
that the board or the Superior Court has rejected shall not be so opened, but
shall be retained as provided for by this act.  The board shall then proceed to
canvass the votes cast on the mail-in ballots, but no such ballot shall be
counted in any primary election for the general election if the ballot of the
political party marked for voting thereon differs from the designation of the
political party in the primary election of which such ballot is intended to be
voted as marked on the envelope by the county board of elections.</p>

bears a postmark date before or of the day of the election and that is received

shall be canvassed.  Every mail-in ballot that does not bear a postmark date
but that is received by the county board by delivery of the United States
Postal Service before, or within 48 hours after, the time of the closing of the
polls for the election for which the ballot was prepared shall be considered
valid and shall be canvassed.</p>

elections begins opening the inner envelopes and canvassing the mail-in ballots
from the inner envelopes prior to the day of the election, the county board
shall implement the measures necessary to ensure the security and secrecy of
the mail-in ballots.  The contents of the mail-in ballots and the results of
the ballot canvassing shall remain confidential and shall be disclosed only in
accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, regulations
and guidelines concerning the disclosure of election results, and in no
circumstances disclosed prior to the close of polls on the day of the
election.  In addition to the guidelines concerning the early canvassing
process, the Secretary of State shall promulgate regulations to ensure that any
county board of elections that begins opening the inner envelopes and
canvassing the mail-in ballots from the inner envelopes prior to the closing of
the polls on election day shall do so in a manner that prevents any person,
including any person who is authorized to receive and canvass completed mail-in
ballots, from obtaining knowledge of the unofficial results of ballots cast for
any candidate for public office or any public question submitted to the voters
until after the closing of the polls on election day.  No tally or tabulation
of results shall occur prior to the opening of polls on election day.  As
provided under R.S.19:34-13, any person who is authorized to receive and
canvass completed mail-in-ballots who knowingly discloses to the public the
contents of a mail-in ballot prior to the time designated by law for the
closing of the polls for each election shall be guilty of a crime of the third
degree.</p>

canvass is completed, the respective county boards of election shall certify
the result of the canvass to the county clerk or the municipal or district
clerk or other appropriate officer, as the case may be, showing the result of
the canvass by municipality and ward.  The votes thus canvassed shall be
counted in determining the result of the election.</p>

Mail Law to require that each new and existing registered voter automatically
receives a mail-in ballot for all elections, unless the voter notifies the
county clerk that the voter no longer wishes to do so, or unless the voter
fails to vote by mail in four consecutive years.  Under the bill, each voter
would be permitted to vote in person at the voters polling place on the day of
the election or during the early voting period, provided the voter surrenders
their mail-in ballot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a
registered voter can choose to vote by mail-in ballot in a single election or
for all future elections, until the voter notifies the county clerk that the
voter no longer wishes to do so, or unless the voter fails to vote by mail in
four consecutive years.  Current law also permits a voter to vote at the
polling place by provisional ballot if the voter requested a mail-in ballot,
but did not receive the ballot, or if the voter received the mail-in ballot,
but appears at a polling place without the ballot.  The bill provides that a
voter who has received a mail-in ballot may vote at a polling place on the day
of election or during the early voting period without using a provisional
ballot provided that the voter surrenders their mail-in ballot, including the
outer envelope with the voters name and address written on it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill increases from five
days to 10 days prior to the day of election that the county board of elections
may begin opening the inner envelopes for each mail-in ballot and canvassing
each mail-in ballot from the inner envelope. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also permits voters
to deliver their voted mail-in ballots to each polling place.  The Secretary of
State is charged with establishing chain of custody procedures for the
verification and acceptance of mail-in ballots surrendered by voters wishing to
vote in person and if the polling place accepts mail-in ballots.</p>
