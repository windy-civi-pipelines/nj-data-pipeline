<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes various
revisions to the law governing the sale of alcoholic beverages in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill grants privileges to
the holders of certain craft alcoholic beverage manufacturer licenses.  Under
the bill, a holder of a <span style='color:black'>limited brewery, plenary
winery, farm winery, craft distillery, and cidery and meadery license would be
entitled to sell food and hold certain activities and events both on and off
the licensed premises.  Specifically, the bill allows craft alcoholic
manufacturer licensees to sell </span>non-alcoholic beverages and food or
operate a restaurant on the licensed premises.  The bill also allows these
craft alcoholic beverage manufacturers to coordinate with any food vendor,
including food trucks, to provide food on the licensed premises or at
off-premises events.  These craft alcoholic beverage manufacturers also would
be entitled to participate in an unlimited number of off-premises events,
including private parties, festivals, and tasting events, subject to a permit obtained
from the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC).<u>  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, craft
alcoholic beverage manufacturers also would be entitled to hold an unlimited
number of events on licensed premises that are scheduled in advance of the
event and limited by invitation or open to the general public.  The bill also
allows craft alcoholic beverage manufacturers to hold private parties on and
off the licensed premises.  Under the bill, the host of a private party would
be entitled to provide any <span style='color:black'>alcoholic beverage,
including alcoholic beverages which are not produced by the license holder,
provided the host is not the licensee and the licensee consents to the
provision of other alcoholic beverages.  </span>A social affairs permit holder
or host of a private party, held on or off the licensed premises, may hire an
employee of the craft manufacturer to pour alcoholic beverages produced on the
licensed premises and provide educational commentary about the alcoholic
beverages produced on the licensed premises.  The bill also allows these craft
alcoholic beverage manufacturers to hold happy hours and sell suitable gift
items and novelty wearing apparel identified with the name of the holder of the
license. <span style='color:black'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     The
bill also removes from current law the tour requirement for limited brewery and
craft distillery license holders.  Under current law, these licensees are
authorized to sell their products at retail to consumers on the licensed
premises for on-site consumption, but only in connection with a tour of the
brewery or distillery.  Under this bill, consumers would not be required to
take a tour of the brewery or distillery to purchase beverages for on-site
consumption.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     The
bill also allows the holder of a restricted brewery license to convert the
license into a limited brewery license in exchange for a fee established by the
ABC.  </span>Under current law, a restricted brewery license is only issued to
a person who also holds a Class C consumption license, which are generally
issued to bars and restaurants.  The restricted brewery license allows the
licensee to brew the beer, while the Class C license allows the licensee to
sell that beer directly to restaurant patrons.  This bill allows the holder of
a restricted brewery license to convert the license into a limited brewery
license, allowing the licensee to sell food or operate a restaurant under the
bill.  The bill also clarifies that craft distillery licensees are entitled to
sell cocktails mixed with non-alcoholic beverages, mixers, or garnishing.  In
addition, the bill removes from current statutory law the fees paid by craft
alcoholic beverage manufacturers and provides that the fee schedule is to be
set by rules and regulations promulgated by the ABC.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, this bill allows
for the issuance of additional plenary retail and seasonal retail consumption
licenses, which allow for the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the
licensed premises.  <span style='color:black'>Under current law, a municipality
may issue plenary retail </span>and seasonal retail consumption <span
style='color:black'>licenses until the combined total number in the
municipality is fewer than one license for each 3,000 municipal residents. 
Because of this restriction, there is a shortage of these licenses in some municipalities. 
This bill addresses this shortage by allowing the incremental issuance of
additional plenary retail consumption licenses over the course of a five year
period, after which time the population restriction would no longer exist.  The
population restriction imposed on the issuance of additional licenses would be
adjusted as follows:</span><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

combined total number of plenary retail consumption or seasonal retail
consumption licenses existing in a municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill makes
certain revisions to the fees paid by plenary retail consumption license
holders and the public notice requirements and procedure to issue additional
plenary retail consumption licenses.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also changes the
procedure for renewing an inactive Class C license.  <span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>Under current law, an inactive Class C license is a retail
license that is not being used at an open and operating licensed premise.  A
licensee is required to place the license on  inactive status  when the
licensed business ceases operation and the license continues to be held by the
licensee of record.  A municipality may renew an inactive license annually for
up to two years following the date it became inactive.  If the license has been
inactive for more than two years, the licensee is required to file a petition
to maintain possession of the license with the Director of the Division of ABC.</span>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>Under this bill, a municipality would have the authority to
renew an inactive Class C license to sell alcoholic beverages regardless of
whether the license has been actively used in connection with the operation of
a licensed premises.  In addition, the bill allows a municipality to deny the
renewal of an inactive Class C license if the license holder has not made a
good faith effort to actively use the license.  This bill removes from current
law the directors authority to grant petitions to renew inactive Class C
licenses and grants the authority to municipalities to renew these licenses
regardless of whether the license is actively used in connection with a
premises.  Under the bill, the governing municipal board or body also may deny
a license renewal application if it finds that the license holder has not made
a good faith effort to resume active use of the license.  A municipal board or
body would be prohibited from denying an application for renewal by a licensee
who establishes by affidavit that the licensee has been deprived of the use of
the licensed premises as a result of eminent domain or fire or other casualty. 
The bill allows a municipal board or body that denies a license renewal to
reissue the license at public sale in accordance with current law.  </span></p>
