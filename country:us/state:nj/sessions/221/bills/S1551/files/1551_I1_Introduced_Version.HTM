the &quot;Internal Affairs Policy and Procedures&quot; of the Police Management
Manual promulgated by the Police Bureau of the Division of Criminal Justice in
the Department of Law and Public Safety be revised to require the disclosure of
reports, complaints, and other investigative materials, including video, sound,
