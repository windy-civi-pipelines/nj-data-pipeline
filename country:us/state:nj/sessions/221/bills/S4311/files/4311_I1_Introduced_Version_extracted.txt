The report shall [be prepared by an independent third-party practitioner based on a review of the firm's financial statements and records, general management, and internal controls, which review shall be conducted in compliance with the standards and procedures developed by the director pursuant to subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2014, c.29 (C.34:8-45.1a).] include information: (i)    the health care service firms insurance coverages; (ii)   any litigation the health care service firm is a party to and a list of all regulatory actions taken by the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety against the health care service firm, including any disposition of same for the previous three years; (iii)  independent contractors used by the health care service firm for the subject year; and (iv)  transactions and liabilities that exceed 50 percent of the firms total billings or liabilities, as appropriate. If the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety determines that, based on the information provided by the health care service firm in the report, there is reason to doubt the health care service firms financial viability, the division may seek additional information from the health care service firm or make an adverse finding and order the health care service firm to take corrective action.  Once the health care service firm complies with or completes the terms of any ordered corrective action, the division shall deem the health care service firm compliant with the requirements of this subsection. (b)   If the division makes adverse findings against a firm upon review of a report submitted pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, the director shall order such corrective action as the director deems appropriate, and, upon compliance with or completion of the corrective action, shall require the firm to obtain a separate review of the firm's data for that year, which shall be conducted by a different independent third-party practitioner than the one that furnished the original report, and shall be based on the standards and procedures developed by the director pursuant to subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2014, c.29 (C.34:8-45.1a).  The firm shall additionally be required to submit to the director an audit for the calendar year next following the year for which the adverse finding was made, regardless of the firm's gross income for the year. An audit required pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted by a certified public accountant licensed by the State of New Jersey and shall encompass an examination of the subject firm's financial records, financial statements, the general management of its operations, and its internal control systems.  The audit shall include an audit report with an unqualified opinion and shall be accompanied by any management letters prepared by the auditor in connection with the audit commenting on the internal controls or management practices of the health care service firm. The audit shall be divided into two components: compliance and financial.  The compliance component of the audit shall evaluate the firm's compliance with relevant laws and regulations governing health care service firms.  The financial component shall include an audit of the financial statements and accompanying notes, as specified in the Statements on Auditing Standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. e.     In addition to any other penalty provided by law, a person shall be liable for a penalty of $500 per day for each day that the person continues to operate a firm without registering as required under this section.  The penalty shall be collected by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in a summary proceeding in accordance with the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).
