(cf: P.L. 2003, c.267, s.4) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill creates the offense of tracking a vehicle with purpose to commit an unlawful act using a location tracking device, and imposes enhanced penalties for the offense. Under the bill, tracking a vehicle with purpose to commit an unlawful act using a location tracking device is a crime of the fourth degree, ordinarily punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000 or both.  Under the bill however, the offense shall be sentenced under N.J.S.A.2C:43-7 to an extended term of imprisonment.  Under N.J.S.A.2C:43-7, a person who has been convicted of a fourth degree crime included under paragraph (5) of subsection a. shall be sentenced, to an extended term of imprisonment of five years. It is the sponsors view that the increased use of electronic device technology such as Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) or GPS-enabled devices to track an individuals whereabouts has contributed to domestic violence abuse, sexual assault, and vehicle theft, and, when misused in this manner, can have widespread damaging and even lethal effect warranting enhanced penalties.
