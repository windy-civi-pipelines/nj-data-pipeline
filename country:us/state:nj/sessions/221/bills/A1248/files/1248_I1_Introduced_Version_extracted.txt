The application shall be on a form prescribed by the director and provided for the use of applicants hereunder.  Each applicant making a claim for a homestead property tax reimbursement under this act shall provide, if required by the director, to the director a copy of his or her current year property tax bill, current year payment in lieu of tax statement, or current year site fee bill on the homestead constituting that person's principal residence and a copy of his or her property tax bill for the base year, payment in lieu of tax statement for the base year, or site fee bill for the base year on the same homestead, or other equivalent proof as permitted by the director. It shall be the duty of every eligible claimant to inform the director of any change in his or her status or homestead which may affect his or her right to continuance of the homestead property tax reimbursement. If an eligible claimant receives an additional homestead property tax reimbursement to which the claimant was not entitled or greater than the reimbursement to which the claimant was entitled, the director shall permit the claimant to enter into an installment payment agreement for a reasonable period of time that will enable the claimant to completely satisfy the amount of the reimbursement paid to which the claimant was not entitled.  If the claimant does not enter into an installment payment agreement, the director may, in addition to all other available legal remedies, offset such amount against a gross income tax refund or amount due pursuant to P.L.1990, c.61. (cf: P.L.2017, c.370, s.1) 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would make a property owner who pays a payment in lieu of property taxes (PILOT) to the municipality in which the property owners real property is located eligible for homestead property tax reimbursement (colloquially, senior freeze). Under current law, only property owners who pay property taxes are eligible for homestead property tax reimbursement payments.
