"Development regulation" means a zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance, site plan ordinance, official map ordinance or other municipal regulation of the use and development of land, or amendment thereto adopted and filed pursuant to P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.).

"Electric vehicle supply equipment" or "electric vehicle service equipment" or "EVSE" means the equipment, including the cables, cords, conductors, connectors, couplers, enclosures, attachment plugs, power outlets, power electronics, transformer, switchgear, switches and controls, network interfaces, and point of sale equipment and associated apparatus designed and used for the purpose of transferring energy from the electric supply system to a plug-in electric vehicle.  "EVSE" may deliver either alternating current or, consistent with fast charging equipment standards, direct current electricity.

"Land" includes improvements and fixtures on, above or below the surface. "Local utility" means any sewerage authority created pursuant to the "sewerage authorities law," P.L.1946, c.138 (C.40:14A-1 et seq.); any utilities authority created pursuant to the "municipal and county utilities authorities law," P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-1 et seq.); or any utility, authority, commission, special district or other corporate entity not regulated by the Board of Regulatory Commissioners under Title 48 of the Revised Statutes that provides gas, electricity, heat, power, water or sewer service to a municipality or the residents thereof. "Lot" means a designated parcel, tract or area of land established by a plat or otherwise, as permitted by law and to be used, developed or built upon as a unit. (cf: P.L.2021, c.171, s.5) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would revise the definition of inherently beneficial use in the Municipal Land Use Law, P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) (MLUL) to include a sterile syringe access program. Under the MLUL, if a use is deemed inherently beneficial it presumptively satisfies the positive criteria for the grant of a use variance under subsection d. of section 57 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55-70). Sterile syringe access programs are designed to prevent the spread of HIV, hepatitis C, and other blood borne pathogens, and have been proven effective in reducing the spread of these pathogens without adverse social impacts or an increase in drug abuse. Additionally, the programs provide drug users with a bridge to treatment and other social services. This bill would make it easier for the programs to be established, providing more individuals with access to the program benefits.
