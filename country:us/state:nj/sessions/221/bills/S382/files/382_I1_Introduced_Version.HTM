<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, designated as the
&quot;Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,&quot; provides that an abortion
is not to be performed or attempted if the probable post-fertilization age of
the unborn child is 20 weeks or greater, with certain exceptions noted below. 
It is to be unlawful for a person to perform an abortion or attempt to do so,
unless the person is a physician who has first made a determination of the
probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child or has reasonably relied
upon this determination made by another physician.  In making the
determination, a physician is to make inquiries of the pregnant woman and
perform any medical examinations or tests necessary to accurately determine
post-fertilization age.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides an exception
to the above provisions if: (1) the abortion is necessary to save the life of a
pregnant women whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or
injury, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by, or arising
from, the pregnancy itself; (2) the pregnancy is the result of rape, if
reported to a law enforcement agency prior to the abortion; or (3) the
pregnancy is the result of rape or incest against a minor, if reported to a law
enforcement agency or to the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP)
in the Department of Children and Families prior to the abortion.  In
terminating or attempting to terminate a pregnancy under these circumstances,
the physician may do so only in a manner which, in reasonable medical judgment,
provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive, unless the
termination of the pregnancy in that manner would pose a greater risk of death
of the pregnant woman or substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a
major bodily function.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also: outlines the procedures
that a physician who performs or attempts an abortion must follow, consistent
with the federal Born Alive Infant Protection Act, if an exception provided
in the bill exists and the pain-capable unborn child survives the abortion or
attempted abortion; outlines the documentation from a law enforcement agency, Department
of Defense victim assistance personnel, or DCCP, that a physician is required
to file proving a pregnant woman or minor seeking an abortion has been raped or
is a victim of incest; requires the woman seeking the abortion, the physician
performing or attempting to perform the abortion, and a witness to sign an informed
consent authorization form; and requires any physician who performs or attempts
an abortion pursuant to the bill to annually submit a summary of all such
abortions to the National Center for Health Statistics as provided by the conditions
outlined in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person who performs or
attempts to perform an abortion in violation of the bill's requirements is to
be guilty of a crime of the third degree (punishable by three to five years
imprisonment or a fine of up to $15,000, or both); however, a woman upon whom
an abortion is to be performed is to be immune from civil or criminal liability.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A woman or the parent of a
minor upon whom an abortion is performed in violation of the provisions of the
the bill may, in a civil action against any person who committed the violation,
obtain appropriate relief the conditions delineated in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill, which is modeled on
H.R.36 of the 114th Congress, is intended to address the concern that an unborn
child is capable of experiencing pain by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not
earlier. Surgeons in the field of maternal and fetal medicine have found it
necessary to sedate an unborn child to prevent the unborn child from engaging
in vigorous movement in reaction to invasive surgery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the purpose of this
Legislature to assert a compelling governmental interest in protecting the
lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence
indicates they are capable of feeling pain.</p>
