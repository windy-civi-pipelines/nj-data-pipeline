&quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968,&nbsp;c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et
seq.), the Commissioner of Human Services shall adopt rules and regulations
necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  This act shall take
effect on the 90th day after enactment, but the Commissioner of Human Services
may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be
necessary for the implementation of the act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill restricts the use of
physical and mechanical restraints on persons with developmental disabilities
by providing that, except in limited circumstances, physical and mechanical
restraints may be used in emergency situations only.  Under current law, in
addition to emergency use, such restraints may be used as planned interventions
as part of approved behavior modification plans, and as a result of inclusion
in these plans, the unusual incident reporting requirements of the Division of
Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Human Services do not apply. 
The bill also excludes aversive techniques as planned interventions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, under the
provisions of the bill, a person receiving services for persons with
developmental disabilities at a public or private facility or from a public or
private agency that provides services for persons with developmental
disabilities, would not be subjected to physical restraint unless:  1)  an
emergency exists that necessitates the use of physical restraint; 2) the
physical restraint is used only for the period that is necessary to contain the
behavior of the person so that the person no longer poses an immediate threat
of causing serious<b> </b>physical injury to himself or others, except that
this period may not exceed one hour; 3) a medical order authorizing the use of
physical restraint is obtained from the person's treating physician before the
application of physical restraint or not later than 15 minutes after the
application; 4) the physician who signed the order or the attending physician
examines the person not later than one working day after the application of
physical restraint; and 5) the use of force in the application of the physical
restraint does not exceed the force that is reasonable and necessary under the
circumstances precipitating the use of physical restraint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The limited circumstances
under which the above provisions would not apply are when physical restraint is
applied for the following reasons:  to assist a person in completing a task if
the person does not resist the application of physical restraint or if the restraint
is minimal in intensity and duration; to escort or carry a person to safety if
the person is in danger in his present location; or to enable a health care
professional<b> </b>to treat the medical needs of the person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With regard to mechanical
restraints, a person receiving services for persons with developmental
disabilities at a facility or from a public or private agency would not be
subjected to mechanical restraint unless:  1) an emergency exists that
necessitates the use of mechanical restraint; 2) a medical order authorizing
the use of mechanical restraint is obtained from the person's treating
physician before the application of the mechanical restraint or not later than
15 minutes after the application of the mechanical restraint; 3) the physician
who signed the order or the attending physician examines the person not later
than one working day after the application of mechanical restraint; 4) the
mechanical restraint is applied by staff trained in the use and application of
the particular restraint; 5) the person is given the opportunity to move and
exercise the parts of his body that are restrained at least 10 minutes for
every 60 minutes of restraint; 6) a member of the staff lessens or discontinues
the mechanical restraint every 15 minutes to determine whether the person will
stop or control dangerous behavior without the use of the restraint; 7) the
record of the person contains a notation that includes the time of day that the
mechanical restraint was lessened or discontinued, the response of the person
to the lessening or discontinuation of the restraint, and the action taken by
the member of the staff to lessen or discontinue the mechanical restraint, as
appropriate; 8) a member of the staff continuously monitors the person during
the time that mechanical restraint is used on the person;<b> </b>and 9) the
mechanical restraint is used only for the period that is necessary to contain
the behavior of the person so that the person no longer poses an immediate
threat of causing serious physical injury to himself or others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The limited circumstances
under which the above provisions would not apply are when mechanical restraint
is applied for the following reasons:  to enable a health care professional to
treat the medical needs of the person; to protect a person who is known to be
at risk of injury to himself because he lacks coordination or suffers from
frequent loss of consciousness; to provide proper body alignment of a person;
or to position a person who has physical disabilities in a manner described in
the person's individual habilitation plan.  In these circumstances, however, a
medical order authorizing the use of mechanical restraint for any of these
purposes would first need to be obtained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For both physical and
mechanical restraints, the bill provides that within one working day of the use
of the restraint, the use is to be reported as an unusual incident, in
accordance with the Division of Developmental Disabilities' policy for
reporting unusual incidents, which would include reporting these incidents to
the person's parent or legal guardian, to an unusual incident report
coordinator in the division, and to the Office of Operations Support, or its
successor, in the Department of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that,
as a condition of licensure, a private facility or agency that provides
services for persons with traumatic brain injury may not use aversive
techniques on persons with traumatic brain injury, and may not use physical or
mechanical restraints unless that use is in accordance with the procedures
outlined in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill includes
a provision requiring staff training in positive approaches to behavior and
completion of a course in understanding the legal and ethical responsibilities
of staff.  The bill also requires the department to develop and maintain a web
site for statistical information about the number of unusual incidents
occurring at public or private facilities or agencies, as well as any reports
or findings from any State monitoring agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines
&quot;emergency&quot; as a situation in which immediate intervention is
necessary to protect the physical safety of a person receiving services at a
facility or from a public or private agency, or to protect the safety of others
from an immediate threat of serious physical injury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends
N.J.S.A.30:6D-5 to exclude &quot;substantial property damage&quot; as a basis
for using chemical restraint in emergency situations, and it amends
N.J.S.A.30:6D-11 to provide that individual habilitation plans may not include
aversive techniques or<b> </b>physical or mechanical restraint as planned
interventions, but may provide for the use of physical or mechanical restraint
in accordance with the limited circumstances described above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is based on Nevada
and Pennsylvania law and is intended to reduce the use of physical and
mechanical restraints and eliminate the use of aversive techniques<b> </b>in
the State in order to address the tragic situation that occurred at a
State-licensed facility in Haddonfield, where a teenage boy with autism, named
Matthew, was improperly restrained and left unattended.</p>
