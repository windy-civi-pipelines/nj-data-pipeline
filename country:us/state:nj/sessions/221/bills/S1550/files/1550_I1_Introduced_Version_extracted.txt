Standardized assessments shall not be used as a measure of student growth or progress [but] and shall not be [the predominant] a factor in [the overall] any evaluation [of a teacher]; (5)   a provision that the rubric be based on the professional standards for that employee; (6)   a provision ensuring that performance measures used in the rubric are linked to student achievement; (7)   a requirement that the employee receive multiple observations during the school year which shall be used in evaluating the employee; (8)   a provision that requires that at each observation of a teacher, either the principal, his designee who shall be an individual employed in the district in a supervisory role and capacity and who possesses a school administrator certificate, principal certificate, or supervisor certificate, the vice-principal, or the assistant principal shall be present; (9)   an opportunity for the employee to improve his effectiveness from evaluation feedback; (10)    guidelines for school districts regarding training and the demonstration of competence on the evaluation system to support its implementation; (11)    a process for ongoing monitoring and calibration of the observations to ensure that the observation protocols are being implemented correctly and consistently; (12)    a performance framework, associated evaluation tools, and observation protocols, including training and observer calibration resources; (13)    a process for a school district to obtain the approval of the commissioner to utilize other evaluation tools; and (14)    a process for ensuring that the results of the evaluation help to inform instructional development. c.     A board of education shall adopt a rubric approved by the commissioner by December 31, 2012. d.    Beginning no later than January 31, 2013, a board of education shall implement a pilot program to test and refine the evaluation rubric. e.     Beginning with the 2013-2014 school year, a board of education shall ensure implementation of the approved, adopted evaluation rubric for all educators in all elementary, middle, and high schools in the district.  Results of evaluations shall be used to identify and provide professional development to teaching staff members.
