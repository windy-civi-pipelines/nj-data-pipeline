A1461 ASSEMBLY, No. 1461 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  ROBERT J. KARABINCHAK District 18 (Middlesex) Assemblyman  JAMES J. KENNEDY District 22 (Somerset and Union) Assemblyman  STERLEY S. STANLEY District 18 (Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Establishes Climate Change Mitigation and Resilience Financing Program in NJ Infrastructure Bank; imposes per-kilowatt hour charge on electric energy consumption to finance climate change mitigation and resilience projects. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the financing of climate change mitigation and resilience projects, amending and supplementing P.L.1985, c.334, and supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.1985, c.334 (C.58:11B-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  The Legislature finds that the steady deterioration of older sewage and sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants endangers the availability and quality of uncontaminated water resources of the State, thereby posing a grave danger to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the concerned communities and the State; that the construction, rehabilitation, operation, and maintenance of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants are essential to protecting and improving the State's water quality; that in addition to protecting and improving water quality, adequate wastewater treatment systems are essential to economic growth and development; that many of the wastewater treatment systems in New Jersey must be replaced or upgraded if an inexorable decline in water quality is to be avoided during the coming decades; that the United States Congress in recognition of the crucial role wastewater treatment systems and plants play in maintaining and improving water quality, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems must be borne by local governments and authorities with limited sources of revenues, established in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, Pub.L.92-500 (33 U.S.C. s.1251 et al.) a program to provide local governments with grants for constructing these systems; that during the last several years the amount of federal grant money available to states and local governments for assistance in constructing and improving wastewater treatment systems has sharply diminished; that the current level of federal grant funding is inadequate to meet the cost of upgrading the State's wastewater treatment capacity to comply with State water quality standards; that the collective needs of the State and local governments for capital financing of wastewater treatment systems far exceed the sums of money presently available through revenue initiatives and State and federal aid programs; and that it is fitting and proper for the State to encourage local governments to undertake wastewater treatment projects through the establishment of a State mechanism to provide loans at the lowest reasonable interest rates and to guarantee or insure local capital improvement bonds. b.    The Legislature finds that stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflows are among the major sources of ocean pollution, contributing to beach closings; that combined sewer systems discharge untreated wastewater and stormwater into rivers, streams and coastal waters during wet weather, resulting in water pollution; that some combined sewer systems have deteriorated to the point that overflows occur regularly, even during dry weather; that many sewer systems are on inadequate repair and replacement programs, which may cause disturbances at sewage treatment plants; that many municipalities are under building moratoriums due to the inadequacy of their sewage and stormwater collection systems, which severely affect municipal budgets; and that large unmet capital expenses exist for combined sewer system separation and abatement projects. The Legislature further finds that funding at the federal level for wastewater treatment, stormwater management and combined sewer system rehabilitation projects is insufficient; that State funds available for these projects are inadequate to meet current needs; that local revenues are insufficient to meet these expenses; and that additional funding at the State level is necessary to meet this financial obligation. c.     The Legislature finds that construction, rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of modern and efficient water supply facilities are essential to protecting and improving the State's water quality; that the citizens of this State, in recognition of the crucial role the construction of new and the upgrading of existing water supply facilities play in maintaining and augmenting the natural water resources of the State, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited financial resource capabilities of local governments and authorities and must be subsidized by the State and repaid through a system of water supply user charges, approved the enactment of the Water Supply Bond Act of 1981 (P.L.1981, c.261); that the water supply needs of the State are so great that the funds allocated for this purpose from the Water Supply Fund established by that 1981 bond act should be augmented and maximized, to the extent practicable, through the use of alternative methods of State financing to offset the costs of water supply projects and for the construction of new or the rehabilitation of antiquated or inadequate existing water supply facilities; that the United States Congress in recognition of the essential role that safe drinking water plays in protecting the public health, and with an understanding that financing, constructing and maintaining water systems that meet the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. s.300f et seq. exceed the financial and technical capacity of the operators of some water systems, has established in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, P.L.104-182, a program to provide public water systems with financial assistance to meet national primary drinking water regulations or to otherwise further the health protection objectives of the federal law and that the State must, in order to make use of the federal funds, provide State funds for the program; and therefore, State funding for the program is necessary to meet this financial obligation. d.    The Legislature finds that the transportation infrastructure of the State is among the most heavily used in the nation and has deteriorated in recent years, with parts of the highway system reaching the end of their useful lives. e.     The Legislature finds that capital projects for roadways and bridges are essential to protecting and improving the State's transportation system; that construction of new and the upgrading of existing roadways and bridges play a critical role in the transportation needs of the State, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited financial resource capabilities of local governments and authorities and must be subsidized by the State and Federal government; that the United States Congress has established State Infrastructure Bank programs to provide funding for transportation systems (23 U.S.C. s.610) and that the State must, in order to make use of the federal funds, provide State funds for the program; and therefore, State funding for the program is necessary to meet this financial obligation. f.     The Legislature finds that there is universal scientific consensus that human activity is the primary cause of climate change over the past century; that climate change is causing sea levels to rise and more frequent droughts, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events that threaten public health, safety, the environment, and critical infrastructure in the State; that, in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, New Jersey must drastically reduce its fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which, in turn, requires the State to increase the pace and amount of investment in clean energy, energy efficiency, and other climate change mitigation projects; that the State must simultaneously take measures to protect its residents, the environment, and critical infrastructure from the adverse effects of climate change; that providing low-interest financing for climate change mitigation and resilience projects will improve the standard of living for New Jersey residents by delivering clean energy more efficiently and at lower cost, and creating long-term, high paying jobs; and that such financing will also ease the economic effects of transitioning from a carbon-based economy to a clean energy economy. g.  The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the public interest to establish a State authority authorized to issue bonds, notes and other obligations and to establish any reserve funds necessary therefor, and to make loans to and guarantee debt incurred by local government units for environmental and transportation infrastructure projects , and to provide loans and other financial assistance for climate change mitigation and resilience projects.

The purpose of the program would be to provide low interest loans and other financial assistance, through the NJIB, for climate change mitigation and resilience projects. Under the bill, climate change mitigation project means a project whose primary purpose is the construction, development, or production of energy sources, infrastructure, land management techniques, or technologies that eliminate, reduce, or sequester greenhouse gas emissions in the State.  Climate change mitigation projects would include Class I or Class II renewable energy sources, community solar projects, energy efficiency improvements, energy storage, zero-emission vehicle infrastructure, zero-emission public transportation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies, reforestation of degraded land, or wetlands preservation and restoration.  Climate change resilience project means an infrastructure project whose primary purpose is to protect human health, safety, the environment, or public infrastructure from the adverse effects of climate change including drought, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and harmful algal blooms.  Climate change resilience projects would include sea barriers or other flood protection projects; water storage systems; the removal, relocation, or redesign of public infrastructure; and projects to mitigate harmful algal blooms. The NJIB would be authorized to make both short-term and long-term loans to finance climate change mitigation and resilience projects, and to issue bonds, notes, or other obligations to fund the program.  Under the bill, the NJIB would be required to issue one or more separate series of bonds to be known as New Jersey Climate Bonds.  Proceeds from the bonds would be deposited into the State Climate Change Mitigation and Resilience Bank Fund, established under the bill, and used to finance climate change mitigation and resilience projects and for other costs associated with the financing program.  Issuance of New Jersey Climate Bonds would be subject to existing laws concerning bonding, except that the trust would, to the greatest extent practicable, be required to make the bonds available for sale to individual investors, rather than institutional investors, and in denominations suitable for such sales. The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) would be responsible for developing a priority system, ranking criteria, and funding policies for climate change mitigation and resilience projects financed under the bill.  The DEP and the BPU would also be responsible for developing an annual project priority list to be submitted for approval by the State Legislature.  The DEP would prioritize projects that have the largest impact on protecting human health, safety, the environment, and critical infrastructure in the State from the adverse effects of climate change; reducing the States greenhouse gas emissions; and meeting the States clean energy goals. The financing program would be funded by a non-bypassable, irrevocable charge imposed on the customers of each electric public utility in the State.  Beginning 120 days after the effective date of the bill, the charge would be $0.0003 per kilowatt-hour sold to each customer.  However, the charge would decrease over time as the State meets certain renewable energy targets established in law.  The charge would phase out completely upon certification by the BPU that 100 percent of the kilowatt hours sold in the State are from Class I and Class II renewable energy sources.

A1461 ASSEMBLY, No. 1461 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  ROBERT J. KARABINCHAK District 18 (Middlesex) Assemblyman  JAMES J. KENNEDY District 22 (Somerset and Union) Assemblyman  STERLEY S. STANLEY District 18 (Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Establishes Climate Change Mitigation and Resilience Financing Program in NJ Infrastructure Bank; imposes per-kilowatt hour charge on electric energy consumption to finance climate change mitigation and resilience projects. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the financing of climate change mitigation and resilience projects, amending and supplementing P.L.1985, c.334, and supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.1985, c.334 (C.58:11B-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  The Legislature finds that the steady deterioration of older sewage and sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants endangers the availability and quality of uncontaminated water resources of the State, thereby posing a grave danger to the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the concerned communities and the State; that the construction, rehabilitation, operation, and maintenance of modern and efficient sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants are essential to protecting and improving the State's water quality; that in addition to protecting and improving water quality, adequate wastewater treatment systems are essential to economic growth and development; that many of the wastewater treatment systems in New Jersey must be replaced or upgraded if an inexorable decline in water quality is to be avoided during the coming decades; that the United States Congress in recognition of the crucial role wastewater treatment systems and plants play in maintaining and improving water quality, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems must be borne by local governments and authorities with limited sources of revenues, established in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, Pub.L.92-500 (33 U.S.C. s.1251 et al.) a program to provide local governments with grants for constructing these systems; that during the last several years the amount of federal grant money available to states and local governments for assistance in constructing and improving wastewater treatment systems has sharply diminished; that the current level of federal grant funding is inadequate to meet the cost of upgrading the State's wastewater treatment capacity to comply with State water quality standards; that the collective needs of the State and local governments for capital financing of wastewater treatment systems far exceed the sums of money presently available through revenue initiatives and State and federal aid programs; and that it is fitting and proper for the State to encourage local governments to undertake wastewater treatment projects through the establishment of a State mechanism to provide loans at the lowest reasonable interest rates and to guarantee or insure local capital improvement bonds. b.    The Legislature finds that stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflows are among the major sources of ocean pollution, contributing to beach closings; that combined sewer systems discharge untreated wastewater and stormwater into rivers, streams and coastal waters during wet weather, resulting in water pollution; that some combined sewer systems have deteriorated to the point that overflows occur regularly, even during dry weather; that many sewer systems are on inadequate repair and replacement programs, which may cause disturbances at sewage treatment plants; that many municipalities are under building moratoriums due to the inadequacy of their sewage and stormwater collection systems, which severely affect municipal budgets; and that large unmet capital expenses exist for combined sewer system separation and abatement projects. The Legislature further finds that funding at the federal level for wastewater treatment, stormwater management and combined sewer system rehabilitation projects is insufficient; that State funds available for these projects are inadequate to meet current needs; that local revenues are insufficient to meet these expenses; and that additional funding at the State level is necessary to meet this financial obligation. c.     The Legislature finds that construction, rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of modern and efficient water supply facilities are essential to protecting and improving the State's water quality; that the citizens of this State, in recognition of the crucial role the construction of new and the upgrading of existing water supply facilities play in maintaining and augmenting the natural water resources of the State, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited financial resource capabilities of local governments and authorities and must be subsidized by the State and repaid through a system of water supply user charges, approved the enactment of the Water Supply Bond Act of 1981 (P.L.1981, c.261); that the water supply needs of the State are so great that the funds allocated for this purpose from the Water Supply Fund established by that 1981 bond act should be augmented and maximized, to the extent practicable, through the use of alternative methods of State financing to offset the costs of water supply projects and for the construction of new or the rehabilitation of antiquated or inadequate existing water supply facilities; that the United States Congress in recognition of the essential role that safe drinking water plays in protecting the public health, and with an understanding that financing, constructing and maintaining water systems that meet the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. s.300f et seq. exceed the financial and technical capacity of the operators of some water systems, has established in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, P.L.104-182, a program to provide public water systems with financial assistance to meet national primary drinking water regulations or to otherwise further the health protection objectives of the federal law and that the State must, in order to make use of the federal funds, provide State funds for the program; and therefore, State funding for the program is necessary to meet this financial obligation. d.    The Legislature finds that the transportation infrastructure of the State is among the most heavily used in the nation and has deteriorated in recent years, with parts of the highway system reaching the end of their useful lives. e.     The Legislature finds that capital projects for roadways and bridges are essential to protecting and improving the State's transportation system; that construction of new and the upgrading of existing roadways and bridges play a critical role in the transportation needs of the State, and with an understanding that the cost of financing and constructing these systems is beyond the limited financial resource capabilities of local governments and authorities and must be subsidized by the State and Federal government; that the United States Congress has established State Infrastructure Bank programs to provide funding for transportation systems (23 U.S.C. s.610) and that the State must, in order to make use of the federal funds, provide State funds for the program; and therefore, State funding for the program is necessary to meet this financial obligation. f.     The Legislature finds that there is universal scientific consensus that human activity is the primary cause of climate change over the past century; that climate change is causing sea levels to rise and more frequent droughts, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events that threaten public health, safety, the environment, and critical infrastructure in the State; that, in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, New Jersey must drastically reduce its fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which, in turn, requires the State to increase the pace and amount of investment in clean energy, energy efficiency, and other climate change mitigation projects; that the State must simultaneously take measures to protect its residents, the environment, and critical infrastructure from the adverse effects of climate change; that providing low-interest financing for climate change mitigation and resilience projects will improve the standard of living for New Jersey residents by delivering clean energy more efficiently and at lower cost, and creating long-term, high paying jobs; and that such financing will also ease the economic effects of transitioning from a carbon-based economy to a clean energy economy. g.  The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the public interest to establish a State authority authorized to issue bonds, notes and other obligations and to establish any reserve funds necessary therefor, and to make loans to and guarantee debt incurred by local government units for environmental and transportation infrastructure projects , and to provide loans and other financial assistance for climate change mitigation and resilience projects.

If, in the 10-day period, the Governor returns the copy of the minutes with a veto of any action taken by the trust or any member thereof at that meeting, the action shall be of no effect. The Senate or General Assembly shall have the right to provide written comments concerning the minutes to the Governor within the 10-day period, which comments shall be returned to the trust by the Governor with the Governor's approval or veto of the minutes.

(cf: P.L.2016, c.56, s.33) 24.  (New section)  a.  The board shall order each electric public utility, beginning 120 days after the effective date of P.L.    , c.   (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill), to charge and collect from each retail distribution customer a non-bypassable, irrevocable charge in the amount of $0.0003 per kilowatt-hour sold to the customer.  Revenues collected by each electric public utility from the non-bypassable, irrevocable charge shall be remitted to the State Treasurer for deposit into the State Climate Change Mitigation and Resilience Bank Fund established pursuant to section 11 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill) and used solely for the purposes of that fund. b.    The charge imposed pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall decrease to: (1) $0.0002 per kilowatt-hour sold upon certification by the President of the Board of Public Utilities that 50 percent of the kilowatt hours sold in the State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation service provider are from Class I and Class II renewable energy sources; (2) $0.0001 per kilowatt-hour sold upon certification by the President of the Board of Public Utilities that 75 percent of the kilowatt hours sold in the State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation service provider are from Class I and Class II renewable energy sources. c.     The charge imposed pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall become inoperative upon certification by the President of the Board of Public Utilities that 100 percent of the kilowatt hours sold in the State by each electric power supplier and each basic generation service provider are from Class I and Class II renewable energy sources.  Any certification made by the President of the Board of Public Utilities pursuant to this section shall take the form of a board order issued pursuant to R.S.48:2-40. 25.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would establish the Climate Change Mitigation and Resilience Financing Program in the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (NJIB) and impose a per-kilowatt hour charge on electric public utility customers to finance the program. The purpose of the program would be to provide low interest loans and other financial assistance, through the NJIB, for climate change mitigation and resilience projects. Under the bill, climate change mitigation project means a project whose primary purpose is the construction, development, or production of energy sources, infrastructure, land management techniques, or technologies that eliminate, reduce, or sequester greenhouse gas emissions in the State.  Climate change mitigation projects would include Class I or Class II renewable energy sources, community solar projects, energy efficiency improvements, energy storage, zero-emission vehicle infrastructure, zero-emission public transportation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies, reforestation of degraded land, or wetlands preservation and restoration.  Climate change resilience project means an infrastructure project whose primary purpose is to protect human health, safety, the environment, or public infrastructure from the adverse effects of climate change including drought, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and harmful algal blooms.  Climate change resilience projects would include sea barriers or other flood protection projects; water storage systems; the removal, relocation, or redesign of public infrastructure; and projects to mitigate harmful algal blooms. The NJIB would be authorized to make both short-term and long-term loans to finance climate change mitigation and resilience projects, and to issue bonds, notes, or other obligations to fund the program.  Under the bill, the NJIB would be required to issue one or more separate series of bonds to be known as New Jersey Climate Bonds.  Proceeds from the bonds would be deposited into the State Climate Change Mitigation and Resilience Bank Fund, established under the bill, and used to finance climate change mitigation and resilience projects and for other costs associated with the financing program.  Issuance of New Jersey Climate Bonds would be subject to existing laws concerning bonding, except that the trust would, to the greatest extent practicable, be required to make the bonds available for sale to individual investors, rather than institutional investors, and in denominations suitable for such sales. The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) would be responsible for developing a priority system, ranking criteria, and funding policies for climate change mitigation and resilience projects financed under the bill.  The DEP and the BPU would also be responsible for developing an annual project priority list to be submitted for approval by the State Legislature.  The DEP would prioritize projects that have the largest impact on protecting human health, safety, the environment, and critical infrastructure in the State from the adverse effects of climate change; reducing the States greenhouse gas emissions; and meeting the States clean energy goals. The financing program would be funded by a non-bypassable, irrevocable charge imposed on the customers of each electric public utility in the State.  Beginning 120 days after the effective date of the bill, the charge would be $0.0003 per kilowatt-hour sold to each customer.  However, the charge would decrease over time as the State meets certain renewable energy targets established in law.  The charge would phase out completely upon certification by the BPU that 100 percent of the kilowatt hours sold in the State are from Class I and Class II renewable energy sources.
