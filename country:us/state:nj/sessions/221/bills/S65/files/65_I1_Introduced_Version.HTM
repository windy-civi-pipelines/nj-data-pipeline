Vacancies in employee-elected director positions resulting from death, resignation, or removal shall be filled for the remainder of the term by a majority vote of the employee-elected members of the board of directors of the Garden State Corporation. 8.    a.  If a corporation is a Garden State Corporation but has not obtained the status of a benefit corporation under the provisions of P.L.2011, c.30 (C.14A:18-1 et seq.), it shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), as follows: (1)   During each of the first five tax years in which it is continuously a Garden State Corporation, but is not a benefit corporation, an amount equal to 35% of the corporations liability for such tax; (2)   During the sixth and seventh tax years in which it is continuously a Garden State Corporation, but is not a benefit corporation, an amount equal to 25% of the corporations liability for such tax; and (3)   During the eight and ninth tax years in which it is continuously a Garden State Corporation, but is not a benefit corporation, an amount equal to 15% of the corporations liability for such tax. b.   Except as provided in subsection c. of this section, if the corporation is a Garden State Corporation and has also obtained the status of a benefit corporation, it shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), as follows: (1)   During each of the first five tax years in which it is continuously both a Garden State Corporation and a benefit corporation, an amount equal to 60% of the corporations liability for such tax; (2)   During the sixth and seventh tax years in which it is continuously both a Garden State Corporation and a benefit corporation, an amount equal to 45% of the corporations liability for such tax; and (3)   During the eight and ninth tax years in which it is continuously both a Garden State Corporation and a benefit corporation, an amount equal to 30% of the corporations liability for such tax. c.    For each year that the corporation receives a tax credit pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, the maximum number of years for which the corporation may receive a tax credit pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section shall be reduced by one year.  For each year that the corporation receives a tax credit pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section, the maximum number of years for which the corporation may receive a tax credit pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section shall be reduced by one year. For each year that the corporation receives a tax credit pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of this section, the maximum number of years for which the corporation may receive a tax credit pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of this section shall be reduced by one year. d.    The order of priority of the application of the credit allowed under this section and any other credits allowed by law shall be as prescribed by the Director of the Division of Taxation.  The amount of the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period shall not exceed the amount of any credit granted pursuant to this section plus the amount of any other credits allowed by law that shall reduce the total tax liability otherwise due by not more than 25 percent, and shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  An unused credit may be carried forward, if necessary, for use in the first privilege period following the privilege period for which the credit is allowed. e.     The director shall develop, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), criteria for determining eligibility under this section, in consultation with the State Treasurer and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. 9.    This act shall take effect on the July 1 next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill permits the establishment of a new type of corporation termed as a Garden State Corporation.  Garden State Corporations would be corporations that are principally engaged in manufacturing, principally utilizing facilities located in New Jersey, and which provide employees with a greater role in the corporate decision-making process.  Garden State Corporations would qualify for credits against the corporation business tax. The bill allows a corporation to be formed as a Garden State Corporation, an existing corporation to convert to become a Garden State Corporation, and a Garden State Corporation to terminate its status as a Garden State Corporation.  The certificate of incorporation or by-laws of a Garden State Corporation must provide that half of the members of the board of directors of the corporation are elected by the employees of the corporation who work in New Jersey facilities. The employee-elected members of the board would have access to all corporation documents and records and equal authority with other members of the board regarding all matters affecting the business and affairs of the corporation, including: · The selection and removal of officers of the corporation; · The amendment or repealing of the by-laws or the certificate of incorporation of the corporation; · Any decision regarding the location of corporation facilities; · Any decision to seek to obtain or terminate the status of the corporation as a benefit corporation under the provisions of P.L.2011, c.30 (C.14A:18-1 et seq.); and · Any decision that may result in the termination of the status of the corporation as a Garden State Corporation. To qualify as a Garden State Corporation, a corporations governing documents must include procedures regarding the election of the employee-elected board members which require that only employees of the Garden State Corporation who work in facilities in New Jersey are eligible to seek election and serve as employee-elected members of the board of directors. The bill requires that each employee of the corporation who works in facilities in New Jersey, without respect the position or rank of the employee or the amount of any ownership interest that the employee may have in the corporation, have the right to vote in the selection of the employee-elected members of the board of directors, with the vote of the employee vote having equal weight with the vote of any other employee, and the right to seek election as an employee-elected member of the board of directors and serve on the board if elected. The bill provides that a Garden State Corporation would qualify for credits against the corporation business tax.  These credits vary as to years of operation and whether the Garden State Corporation is also a benefit corporation under P.L.2011, c.30 (C.14A:18-1 et seq.). If a corporation is a Garden State Corporation but not a benefit corporation, the bill allows the corporation credits against its liability for the corporation business tax of: 35% during the first five tax years in which it is continuously a Garden State Corporation; 25% during the sixth and seventh tax years, and 15% during the eight and ninth tax years. If a corporation is both a Garden State Corporation and a benefit corporation, the bill allows the corporation credits against its liability for the corporation business tax of: 60% during the first five tax years in which it is continuously both a Garden State Corporation and a benefit corporation; 45% during the sixth and seventh tax years, and 30% during the eight and ninth tax years. The number of tax years in which the lower tax credit for being only a Garden State Corporation applies would be reduced by the number of years in which the higher tax credit for being both a Garden State Corporation and a benefit corporation applies, thus limiting to nine the total number of tax years to which the credits may apply.
