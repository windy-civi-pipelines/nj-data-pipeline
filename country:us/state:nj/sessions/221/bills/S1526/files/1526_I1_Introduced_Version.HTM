all buildings actually used in the work of associations and corporations organized exclusively for religious purposes, including religious worship, or charitable purposes, provided that if any portion of a building used for that purpose is leased to a profit-making organization or is otherwise used for purposes which are not themselves exempt from taxation, that portion shall be subject to taxation and the remaining portion shall be exempt from taxation, and provided further that if any portion of a building is used for a different exempt use by an exempt entity, that portion shall also be exempt from taxation;

the buildings, not exceeding two, actually occupied as a parsonage by the officiating clergymen of any religious corporation of this State, together with the accessory buildings located on the same premises; the land whereon any of the buildings hereinbefore mentioned are erected, and which may be necessary for the fair enjoyment thereof, and which is devoted to the purposes above mentioned and to no other purpose and does not exceed five acres in extent; the furniture and personal property in said buildings if used in and devoted to the purposes above mentioned; all property owned and used by any nonprofit corporation in connection with its curriculum, work, care, treatment and study of men, women, or children with intellectual disabilities shall also be exempt from taxation, provided that such corporation conducts and maintains research or professional training facilities for the care and training of men, women, or children with intellectual disabilities; provided, in case of all the foregoing, the buildings, or the lands on which they stand, or the associations, corporations or institutions using and occupying them as aforesaid, are not conducted for profit, except that the exemption of the buildings and lands used for charitable, benevolent or religious purposes shall extend to cases where the charitable, benevolent or religious work therein carried on is supported partly by fees and charges received from or on behalf of beneficiaries using or occupying the buildings;

As used in this section "hospital purposes" includes health care facilities for the elderly, such as nursing homes; residential health care facilities; assisted living residences; facilities with a Class C license pursuant to P.L.1979, c.496 (C.55:13B-1 et al.), the "Rooming and Boarding House Act of 1979"; similar facilities that provide medical, nursing or personal care services to their residents; and that portion of the central administrative or service facility of a continuing care retirement community that is reasonably allocable as a health care facility for the elderly. (cf: P.L.2021, c.17, s.5) 2.    This act shall take effect on January 1 next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT Under R.S.54:4-3.6, all buildings actually used for colleges, schools, academies, and seminaries, are exempt from property taxation.  This exemption extends to faculty housing provided at these educational institutions.  These educational institutions that provide faculty housing to faculty members who may have children attending local public schools currently contribute nothing toward the education of those children, thereby burdening other property taxpayers with the cost of educating these children in the local public schools.  Property tax exempt faculty housing also does not support the costs of providing municipal and county services. This bill would limit property tax exempt housing at these educational institutions to only student dormitories, a maintenance supervisors residence, and a presidential residence, and not to housing for faculty or other employees of the educational institution, thereby requiring educational institutions to pay property taxes on the assessed value of their faculty housing for the support of all governmental entities funded through the local property tax levy.
