STATEMENT This bill reduces the State sales tax rate in half on retail sales of tangible personal property made by a seller that is a small business enterprise in this State.  By allowing small businesses to charge half of the states sales tax rate of 6.625%, or roughly 3.3%, this bill will attract customers to small businesses in New Jersey.  The bill will also encourage organic growth and assist hard working New Jersey small business owners who compete with large corporate big box stores. The reduced sales tax rate will apply to businesses that have their principal place of business in this State, are independently owned and operated, and employ the equivalent of fewer than 50 full-time employees.  The reduced will not apply to retail sales of motor vehicles, of alcoholic beverages, of specified digital products, and cigarettes and retail sales already subject to a reduced rate made by a qualified business in an Urban Enterprise Zone, and made at a reduced tax rate applied since August, 1994, in Salem County.
