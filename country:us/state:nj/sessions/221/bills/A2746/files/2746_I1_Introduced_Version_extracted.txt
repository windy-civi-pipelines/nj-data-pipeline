STATEMENT This bill requires restaurants that employ 15 or more people to offer sexual harassment training every five years. This training would be given to each new employee within 90 days of being hired.  The training would be interactive, include practical examples, and explain how to file a sexual harassment complaint.  The training would be specific to the restaurant industry and it should include separate courses for supervisors and supervisees, with appropriate topics selected for each course.  The bill also requires each restaurant to adopt and promulgate a sexual harassment policy. The bill does not require restaurants to maintain documentation of each sexual harassment training course, but it does establish a rebuttable presumption that, if the restaurant cannot provide such documentation for an employee, then that employee did not receive the training. Restaurants that fail to provide the training or adopt and distribute a sexual harassment policy will be fined up to $500 for a first offense.
