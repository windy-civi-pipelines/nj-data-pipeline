<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
Inclusive Workplaces Program (program) within the New Jersey Economic
Development Authority (EDA) to encourage investments in inclusive workspaces
that accommodate neurodivergent employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the program
would consist of two distinct components, including:  (1) the issuance of grants
to eligible small-business employers to support the development of
neurodiversity-friendly workspaces; and (2) the issuance of tax credits to
eligible large-business employers that have implemented workplace adjustments
that foster neurodiversity-friendly workspaces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notably, the bill allows the
EDA to award up to $2.5 million in grants annually and to award up to $2.5
million in tax credits annually to eligible employers that undertake certain
capital investments and workforce investments intended to create a working
environment that accommodates a neurodiverse workforce.  Capital investments
and workforce investments that employers may undertake include, but are not
limited to:  (1) sensory-friendly workspace layouts, such as quiet zones and
lighting adjustments; (2) adaptive equipment and technologies, such as
noise-cancelling headphones and organization tools; and (3) workforce training
programs, such as staff mentorships and management seminars focused on
neurodiversity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, eligibility
for grants would be limited to employers that have their headquarters or base
of operations in this State, employ fewer than 150 full-time employees, employ
at least one full-time employee who identifies as neurodivergent; and
demonstrate a commitment to inclusive workplaces with a focus on neurodiverse
inclusion are eligible to apply for a grant under the program.  Eligible
small-business employers may apply to the EDA to receive a grant of up to
$25,000 to fund qualified capital investments and workforce investments
incurred after the date of the application.  The bill appropriates $2.5 million
from the General Fund to the EDA for grants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Eligibility for tax credits
would be limited to employers that have their headquarters or base of
operations in this State, employ 150 full-time employees or greater, employ at
least three full-time employees who identify as neurodivergent, and demonstrate
a commitment to inclusive workplaces with a focus on neurodiverse inclusion are
eligible to apply for a tax credit under the program.  Eligible large-business
employers may apply to the EDA to receive tax credits in an amount equal to the
lesser of $25,000 or 50 percent of the qualified capital investments and
workforce investments incurred by the employer before the date of the
application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the EDA would
be permitted to prescribe the form and manner in which applications would be
submitted for both program components.  The bill also permits the EDA to
approve applications on a rolling basis, subject to the annual limitations in grant
awards and tax credit issuances for each program component.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also appropriates
$2.5 million from the General Fund to the EDA to support the provisions of
grants under the program.</p>
