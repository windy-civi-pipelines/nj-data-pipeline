If you are opposed thereto make a cross (X), plus (+) or check (a) in the square opposite the word "No." b.    In every municipality the following question: CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ELIMINATE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ARBITRATION RULINGS IN DISPUTES BETWEEN JUDICIARY AND COUNTY CONCERNING COURT FACILITIES YES Do you approve amending the Constitution to eliminate Supreme Court review of an arbitrators ruling in disputes between the court and a county about the cost of court facilities? INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO Current law provides that counties are responsible for the cost of court facilities.  In the event of a dispute between a county and the courts concerning court facilities, the dispute may be referred to arbitration.  Currently, the decision of the arbitrators is not binding and can be changed by the Supreme Court.  This amendment removes the ability of the Supreme Court to change the arbitrators ruling. The arbitrators decision would be final. A yes vote would amend the Constitution to prevent the Supreme Court from changing an arbitration decision. A no vote would leave the Constitution unchanged.  The Supreme Court would be able to change the arbitrators decision. STATEMENT This constitutional amendment would eliminate the authority of the New Jersey Supreme Court to review and change arbitrators decisions in cases involving courthouse facility disputes between the Judiciary and county governing bodies. Under current law, the counties are responsible for the costs of construction and renovation of courthouse facilities.  In some instances, disputes arise between the counties and the Judiciary concerning factors such as the design or construction of specific facilities. The Rules of Court provide that a dispute between the county governing body and the Judiciary can be submitted to arbitration, at the request of either party.  According to the Rules of Court, the decision of the arbitrator is subject to review by the Supreme Court and can be vacated, modified or corrected if the court determines that the decision fails to balance the needs and interest of the county and the Judiciary in a fair manner.  Effectively, this means that the Judiciary can overturn a decision in which the Judiciary is a party based upon the Constitutional authority of the Supreme Court over practice and procedure in the State courts.  Adoption of this amendment would end the Supreme Courts ability to overturn the arbitrators decision.
