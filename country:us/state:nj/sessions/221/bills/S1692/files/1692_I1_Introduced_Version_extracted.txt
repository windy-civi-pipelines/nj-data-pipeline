By requiring that all supplemental payments beyond standard pay be posted publicly and approved by a municipalitys governing body, it is the intent of the sponsor to ensure that municipal taxpayers are made aware of the financial impacts of this additional compensation. The bill would take effect on the first day of the sixth month after enactment.
