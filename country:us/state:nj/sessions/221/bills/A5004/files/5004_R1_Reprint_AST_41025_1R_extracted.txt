(3)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this subsection shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as set forth in N.J.S.2C:43-7.  For the purposes of this paragraph, an offense is considered a second or subsequent offense if the actor has at any time been convicted pursuant to subsections b., c., or d. of this section, or under any similar statute of the United States, this State, or any other state for an offense that is substantially equivalent to subsections b., c., or d. of this section. f.  Nothing in subsections b., c., d., or e. of this section shall be construed to preclude or limit any prosecution or conviction for an offense set forth 1in1 any other subsection of this section. g.    If the purported child who is depicted as engaging in, or who is caused to engage in, a prohibited sexual act or simulation of a prohibited sexual act or portrayed in a sexually suggestive manner is under the age of 18, the actor shall be strictly liable and it shall not be a defense that the actor did not know that the child was under the age of 18, nor shall it be a defense that the actor believed that the child was 18 years of age or older, even if such a mistaken belief was reasonable. h.  (1)  For aggregation purposes, each depiction of the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, identifiable child, or purported child shall be considered a separate item, provided that each depiction that is in the form of a photograph, picture, image, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be one item and each depiction that is in the form of a film, video, video-clip, movie, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be 10 separate items, and each individual act of distribution of an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, identifiable child, or purported child shall be considered a separate item. (2)  For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, identifiable child, or purported child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subsection d. of this section, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the act or acts constituting the violation occurred at the same time or at different times and, with respect to distribution, whether the act or acts of distribution were to the same person or several persons or occurred at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations. (3)  For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, identifiable child, or purported child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subsection e. of this section, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the possession of such items occurred at the same time or at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations. 2.  Section 2 of P.L.2011, c.128 (C.2A:4A-71.1) is amended to read as follows: 2.  a.  Where a complaint against a juvenile pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-30) alleges that the juvenile has committed an eligible offense as defined in subsection c. of this section and the court has approved diversion of the complaint pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1982, c.81 (C.2A:4A-73), the resolution of the complaint shall include the juveniles participation in a remedial education or counseling program.  The court shall take into consideration the availability of such a program in the area in which the juvenile resides and, where appropriate, may permit the juvenile to participate in a self-guided awareness program in lieu of a remedial education or counseling program provided that it satisfies the requirements of subsection b. of this section. b.    A remedial education or counseling program satisfies the requirements of P.L.2011, c.128 if the program is designed to increase the juveniles awareness of: (1)  the legal consequences and penalties for sharing sexually suggestive or explicit materials, including applicable federal and State statutes; (2)  the non-legal consequences of sharing sexually suggestive or explicit materials including, but not limited to, the effect on relationships, loss of educational and employment opportunities, and being barred or removed from school programs and extracurricular activities; (3)  the potential, based upon the unique characteristics of cyberspace and the Internet, of long-term and unforeseen consequences for sharing sexually suggestive or explicit materials; and (4)  the possible connection between bullying and cyber-bullying and juveniles sharing sexually suggestive or explicit materials. c.    As used in P.L.2011, c.128, eligible offense means an offense in which: (1)  the facts of the case involve the creation, exhibition, or distribution of a photograph depicting nudity or portraying a child in a sexually suggestive manner, as defined in [N.J.S.2C:24-4] section 1 of P.L.     , c.      (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), through the use of an electronic communication device, an interactive wireless communications device, or a computer; and (2)  the creator and subject of the photograph are juveniles or were juveniles at the time of its making.

Section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19) is amended to read as follows: 5.  a.  A prosecutor may file a motion with the court at any time, including any time before or after an eligible defendants release pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17), seeking the pretrial detention of an eligible defendant for: (1)  any crime of the first or second degree enumerated under subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.2C:43-7.2); (2)  any crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to an ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment; (3)  any crime if the eligible defendant has been convicted of two or more offenses under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection; (4)  any crime enumerated under paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2) or crime involving human trafficking pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.77 (C.2C:13-8) or P.L.2013, c.51 (C.52:17B-237 et al.) when the victim is a minor, or the crime of endangering the welfare of a child under N.J.S.2C:24-4, or 1[child pornography] child sexual abuse or exploitation material1 under section 1 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (5)  any crime enumerated under subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:43-6; (6)  any crime or offense involving domestic violence as defined in subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19); or (7)  any other crime for which the prosecutor believes there is a serious risk that: (a)  the eligible defendant will not appear in court as required; (b)  the eligible defendant will pose a danger to any other person or the community; or (c)  the eligible defendant will obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice, or threaten, injure, or intimidate, or attempt to threaten, injure or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror. b.    When a motion for pretrial detention is filed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the eligible defendant shall be detained pending trial because no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary condition or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendants appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, if the court finds probable cause that the eligible defendant: (1)  committed murder pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-3; or (2)  committed any crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to an ordinary or extended term of life imprisonment. c.    A court shall hold a hearing to determine whether any amount of monetary bail or non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary bail and conditions, including those set forth under subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-17) will reasonably assure the eligible defendants appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. d.  (1)  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the pretrial detention hearing shall be held no later than the eligible defendants first appearance unless the eligible defendant, or the prosecutor, seeks a continuance.  If a prosecutor files a motion for pretrial detention after the eligible defendants first appearance has taken place or if no first appearance is required, the court shall schedule the pretrial detention hearing to take place within three working days of the date on which the prosecutors motion was filed, unless the prosecutor or the eligible defendant seeks a continuance.  Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of the eligible defendant may not exceed five days, not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.  Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of the prosecutor may not exceed three days, not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. (2)  Upon the filing of a motion by the prosecutor seeking the pretrial detention of the eligible defendant and during any continuance that may be granted by the court, the eligible defendant shall be detained in jail, unless the eligible defendant was previously released from custody before trial, in which case the court shall issue a notice to appear to compel the appearance of the eligible defendant at the detention hearing.  The court, on motion of the prosecutor or sua sponte, may order that, while in custody, an eligible defendant who appears to be a drug-dependent person receive an assessment to determine whether that eligible defendant is drug-dependent. e.  (1)  At the pretrial detention hearing, the eligible defendant has the right to be represented by counsel, and, if financially unable to obtain adequate representation, to have counsel appointed.  The eligible defendant shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing, and to present information by proffer or otherwise.  The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials shall not apply to the presentation and consideration of information at the hearing. (2)  In pretrial detention proceedings for which there is no indictment, the prosecutor shall establish probable cause that the eligible defendant committed the predicate offense.  A presumption of pretrial detention as provided in subsection b. of this section may be rebutted by proof provided by the eligible defendant, the prosecutor, or from other materials submitted to the court.  The standard of proof for a rebuttal of the presumption of pretrial detention shall be a preponderance of the evidence.  If proof cannot be established to rebut the presumption, the court may order the eligible defendant's pretrial detention.  If the presumption is rebutted by sufficient proof, the prosecutor shall have the opportunity to establish that the grounds for pretrial detention exist pursuant to this section. (3)  Except when an eligible defendant has failed to rebut a presumption of pretrial detention pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the courts finding to support an order of pretrial detention pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18) that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary bail and conditions will reasonably assure the eligible defendants appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence. f.     The hearing may be reopened, before or after a determination by the court, at any time before trial, if the court finds that information exists that was not known to the prosecutor or the eligible defendant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the eligible defendants appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process. g.    When a motion for pretrial detention is filed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, a pretrial recommendation of no release pursuant to subsection f. of section 6 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-20) may constitute prima facie evidence to overcome the presumption of release as set forth in subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18), if the court finds probable cause that the eligible defendant committed any crime for which the eligible defendant would be subject to a mandatory term of imprisonment pursuant to subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:43-6 for a crime involving the use or possession of a firearm other than a violation of: (1)  subsection a. or d. of N.J.S.2C:39-3; (2)  paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:39-4; (3)  subsection a. of section 1 of P.L. 1998, c.26 (C.2C:39-4.1); or (4)  paragraph (1) of subsection b. or paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:39-5.

(2)  The nature and seriousness of the offense; (3)  The circumstances under which the offense occurred; (4)  The date of the offense; (5)  The age of the individual when the offense was committed; (6)  Whether the offense was an isolated or repeated incident;

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6: (a)  A person whose offense under this paragraph involved at least 25 but less than 1,000 items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, identifiable child, or purported child shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, which shall be fixed at, or between, one-third and one-half of the sentence imposed by the court or five years, whichever is greater, during which the defendant shall be ineligible for parole.

(c)  A person convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this paragraph shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as set forth in N.J.S.2C:43-7.  For the purposes of this paragraph, an offense is considered a second or subsequent offense if the actor has at any time been convicted pursuant to subsections b., c., d., or e. of this section, or under any similar statute of the United States, this State, or any other state for an offense that is substantially equivalent to subsections b., c., d., or e. of this section. e.  Possession.

(b)  A person commits a crime of the second degree if he knowingly possesses, knowingly views, or knowingly has under his control, through any means, including the Internet, at least 1,000 but less than 100,000 items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child or identifiable child.

(2)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of N.J.S.2C:44-1, in any instance where a person was convicted of an offense under this subsection that involved 100 or more items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child or identifiable child, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others. (3)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this subsection shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as set forth in N.J.S.2C:43-7.  For the purposes of this paragraph, an offense is considered a second or subsequent offense if the actor has at any time been convicted pursuant to subsections b., c., or d. of this section, or under any similar statute of the United States, this State, or any other state for an offense that is substantially equivalent to subsections b., c., or d. of this section. f.  Nothing in subsections b., c., d., or e. of this section shall be construed to preclude or limit any prosecution or conviction for an offense set forth 1in1 any other subsection of this section. g.    If the purported child who is depicted as engaging in, or who is caused to engage in, a prohibited sexual act or simulation of a prohibited sexual act or portrayed in a sexually suggestive manner is under the age of 18, the actor shall be strictly liable and it shall not be a defense that the actor did not know that the child was under the age of 18, nor shall it be a defense that the actor believed that the child was 18 years of age or older, even if such a mistaken belief was reasonable. h.  (1)  For aggregation purposes, each depiction of the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, identifiable child, or purported child shall be considered a separate item, provided that each depiction that is in the form of a photograph, picture, image, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be one item and each depiction that is in the form of a film, video, video-clip, movie, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be 10 separate items, and each individual act of distribution of an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, identifiable child, or purported child shall be considered a separate item. (2)  For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, identifiable child, or purported child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subsection d. of this section, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the act or acts constituting the violation occurred at the same time or at different times and, with respect to distribution, whether the act or acts of distribution were to the same person or several persons or occurred at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations. (3)  For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, identifiable child, or purported child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subsection e. of this section, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the possession of such items occurred at the same time or at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations. 2.  Section 2 of P.L.2011, c.128 (C.2A:4A-71.1) is amended to read as follows: 2.  a.  Where a complaint against a juvenile pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-30) alleges that the juvenile has committed an eligible offense as defined in subsection c. of this section and the court has approved diversion of the complaint pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1982, c.81 (C.2A:4A-73), the resolution of the complaint shall include the juveniles participation in a remedial education or counseling program.  The court shall take into consideration the availability of such a program in the area in which the juvenile resides and, where appropriate, may permit the juvenile to participate in a self-guided awareness program in lieu of a remedial education or counseling program provided that it satisfies the requirements of subsection b. of this section. b.    A remedial education or counseling program satisfies the requirements of P.L.2011, c.128 if the program is designed to increase the juveniles awareness of: (1)  the legal consequences and penalties for sharing sexually suggestive or explicit materials, including applicable federal and State statutes; (2)  the non-legal consequences of sharing sexually suggestive or explicit materials including, but not limited to, the effect on relationships, loss of educational and employment opportunities, and being barred or removed from school programs and extracurricular activities; (3)  the potential, based upon the unique characteristics of cyberspace and the Internet, of long-term and unforeseen consequences for sharing sexually suggestive or explicit materials; and (4)  the possible connection between bullying and cyber-bullying and juveniles sharing sexually suggestive or explicit materials. c.    As used in P.L.2011, c.128, eligible offense means an offense in which: (1)  the facts of the case involve the creation, exhibition, or distribution of a photograph depicting nudity or portraying a child in a sexually suggestive manner, as defined in [N.J.S.2C:24-4] section 1 of P.L.     , c.      (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), through the use of an electronic communication device, an interactive wireless communications device, or a computer; and (2)  the creator and subject of the photograph are juveniles or were juveniles at the time of its making.

(2)  Upon the filing of a motion by the prosecutor seeking the pretrial detention of the eligible defendant and during any continuance that may be granted by the court, the eligible defendant shall be detained in jail, unless the eligible defendant was previously released from custody before trial, in which case the court shall issue a notice to appear to compel the appearance of the eligible defendant at the detention hearing.  The court, on motion of the prosecutor or sua sponte, may order that, while in custody, an eligible defendant who appears to be a drug-dependent person receive an assessment to determine whether that eligible defendant is drug-dependent. e.  (1)  At the pretrial detention hearing, the eligible defendant has the right to be represented by counsel, and, if financially unable to obtain adequate representation, to have counsel appointed.  The eligible defendant shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing, and to present information by proffer or otherwise.  The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials shall not apply to the presentation and consideration of information at the hearing. (2)  In pretrial detention proceedings for which there is no indictment, the prosecutor shall establish probable cause that the eligible defendant committed the predicate offense.  A presumption of pretrial detention as provided in subsection b. of this section may be rebutted by proof provided by the eligible defendant, the prosecutor, or from other materials submitted to the court.  The standard of proof for a rebuttal of the presumption of pretrial detention shall be a preponderance of the evidence.  If proof cannot be established to rebut the presumption, the court may order the eligible defendant's pretrial detention.  If the presumption is rebutted by sufficient proof, the prosecutor shall have the opportunity to establish that the grounds for pretrial detention exist pursuant to this section.

For purposes of this subsection, a persons consent to being photographed, filmed, videotaped, recorded, observed, or otherwise having their image reproduced shall not be construed to include or imply the persons consent to the disclosure or to the manipulated depiction of such image or recording.  A persons consent to disclosure shall be strictly construed to be limited only to the express purpose for which consent was obtained.

(C.30:4-123.51b) authorizing revocation and return to prison shall be applicable to such a defendant, notwithstanding that the defendant may not have been sentenced to or served any portion of a custodial term for conviction of an offense enumerated in subsection a. of this section. c.    A person sentenced to a term of parole supervision for life may petition the Superior Court for release from that parole supervision.  The judge may grant a petition for release from a special sentence of parole supervision for life only upon proof by clear and convincing evidence that the person has

from parole supervision.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 22 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.66), a person sentenced to a term of parole supervision for life may be released from that parole supervision term only by court order as provided in this subsection. d.    A person who violates a condition of a special sentence of community supervision for life or parole supervision for life imposed pursuant to this section without good cause is guilty of a crime of the third degree.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a person sentenced pursuant to this subsection shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, unless the court is clearly convinced that the interests of justice so far outweigh the need to deter this conduct and the interest in public safety that a sentence to imprisonment would be a manifest injustice.
