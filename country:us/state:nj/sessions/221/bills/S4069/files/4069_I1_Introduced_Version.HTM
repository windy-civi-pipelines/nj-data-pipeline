(cf: P.L.2007, c.268, s.4) 4.     Section 21 of P.L.1991, c.441 (C.40A:21-21) is amended to read as follows: 21.   The governing body of a municipality adopting an ordinance pursuant to this act shall report, on or before October 1 of each year, to the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs and to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, the chief financial officer of the county, and the county counsel the total amount of real property taxes exempted and the total amount abated within the municipality in the current tax year for each of the following: a.   improvements of dwellings; b.   construction of dwellings; c.   improvements and conversions of multiple dwellings; d.   improvements of commercial or industrial structures; e.   construction of multiple dwellings under tax agreements; and f.    construction of commercial or industrial structures under tax agreements. In the case of e. and f. above, the report shall state instead the total amount of payments made in lieu of taxes according to each formula utilized by the municipality, and the difference between that total amount and the total amount of real property taxes which would have been paid on the project had the tax agreement not been in effect, for the current tax year. The Director of the Division of Taxation shall include a summary of the information provided in the annual reports in the annual report of the division. (cf: P.L.1991, c.441, s.21) 5.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the ninth month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill encourages municipal governing bodies to give greater consideration to the costs and benefits likely to flow from their approval of a financial agreement that awards a long term tax exemption to an urban renewal entity.  Additionally, the bill would require municipalities to provide information to certain county government officials when entering into tax agreements awarding a five-year tax exemption or abatement.  The bill would also require the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) to create and maintain a database on its Internet website that displays information about long term tax exemptions that have been awarded by municipalities. The bill requires an urban renewal entitys application for a long term property tax exemption to contain a cost-benefit analysis of the projects impact on the finances of the municipality, county, school district, and other taxing districts, within which the project is located.  Under the bill, the mayor or other chief executive officer of the municipality is required to produce an independent cost-benefit analysis, and is required to submit both cost-benefit analyses to the municipal governing body at the time of submission of the urban renewal entitys application to the municipal governing body for the governing bodys approval or disapproval of the application.  The bill also requires a municipal governing body to include specific findings in a resolution approving or disapproving an application for a long term property tax exemption, which address the net impact of the project on the finances of the affected local governments, including the municipality, county, and school district. This bill requires municipalities to consider and evaluate whether an investment in a redevelopment project through the grant of a long term property tax exemption will generate satisfactory revenue returns to the municipality, as well as the financial impacts to counties, school districts, and other local governments. Under the bill, the cost-benefit analyses and financial impact findings required for grants of long term property tax exemptions would have to be published on the Internet website of the granting municipality, excluding project specific information deemed to be proprietary by the parties involved.  If the municipality does not have a website, this information would have to be provided for public inspection on the Internet website of DCA.  This bill would also require the cost-benefit analyses and findings to be part of the public record. The bill requires municipalities that grant new long term property tax exemptions to provide pertinent information about each approved project to DCA.  The bill directs DCA to publish that information, along with existing long term property tax exemption information retrieved from plain language budget summaries submitted to DCA, in a database, sorted by municipality, on its Internet website. Finally, the bill amends the "Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law" to require a municipality to forward a copy of a tax agreement  awarding a five-year property tax exemption or abatement to the chief financial officer of the county and the county counsel, within 10 days of execution of the agreement.  The bill also requires a municipal governing body to provide those county officials with the annual report of the total amount of real property taxes exempted and the total amount abated within the municipality.  Current law requires municipalities to annually report this information to certain State government officials.
