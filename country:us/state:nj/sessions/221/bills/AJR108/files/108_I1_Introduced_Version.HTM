Section 38 of P.L.1960, c.52 (C.2A:84A-38) provides a procedure for the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Resolved </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Pursuant to section 38
of P.L.1960, c.52 (C.2A:84A-38), the Supreme Court of New Jersey may adopt the
amendatory rule specified in this section in the form set out, at any time
after this joint resolution has been delivered to and signed by the Governor of
the State of New Jersey, by entering an order that the amendment is adopted and
by causing true copies of its order of adoption to be delivered to the
President of the Senate, the Speaker of the General Assembly and the Governor,
without presenting the subject matter and a tentative draft of rules at a
Judicial Conference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Rule 803 is amended to read as
follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     803. Hearsay Exceptions Not
Dependent on Declarant's Unavailability</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>The following statements are not
excluded by the hearsay rule:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) A Declarant-Witness Prior
Statement.&nbsp;The declarant-witness testifies and is subject to
cross-examination about a prior otherwise admissible statement, and the
statement:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) is inconsistent with the
declarant-witness' testimony at the trial or hearing and is offered in
compliance with Rule 613.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     However, when the statement is
offered by the party calling the declarant-witness, it is admissible only if,
in addition to the foregoing requirements, it (A) is contained in a sound
recording or in a writing made or signed by the declarant-witness in
circumstances establishing its reliability or (B) was given under oath at a
trial or other judicial, quasi-judicial, legislative, administrative or grand
jury proceeding, or in a deposition; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) is consistent with the
declarant-witness' testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied
charge against the declarant-witness of (A) recent fabrication or (B) improper
influence or motive; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) is a prior identification
of a person made after perceiving that person if made in circumstances
precluding unfairness or unreliability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) Statement by
Party-Opponent.&nbsp;The statement is offered against a party-opponent and is:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the party-opponent's own statement,
made either in an individual or in a representative capacity; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) a statement whose content
the party-opponent has adopted by word or conduct or in whose truth the
party-opponent has manifested belief; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) a statement by a person
authorized by the party-opponent to make a statement concerning the subject; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) a statement by the
party-opponent's agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the
agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) a statement made at the
time the party-opponent and the declarant were participating in a plan to
commit a crime or civil wrong and the statement was made in furtherance of that
plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In a criminal case, the
admissibility of a defendant's statement, which is offered against the
defendant, is subject to Rule 104(c).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c) Statements Not Dependent
on Declarant's Availability.&nbsp;The following are not excluded by the rule
against hearsay, regardless of whether the declarant is available as a witness:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) Present Sense
Impression.&nbsp;A statement describing or explaining an event or condition,
made while or immediately after the declarant perceived it and without
opportunity to deliberate or fabricate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Excited Utterance.&nbsp;A
statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant
