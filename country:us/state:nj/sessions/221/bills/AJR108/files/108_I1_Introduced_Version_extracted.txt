STATEMENT This joint resolution would clarify an exception to the hearsay rule, Rule 803 of the Rules of Evidence, concerning a persons medical diagnosis or treatment for purposes of providing, continuing, or ending mental health services.  The use of hearsay testimony about a persons medical history or present condition may be a vital source in making such treatment decisions.
