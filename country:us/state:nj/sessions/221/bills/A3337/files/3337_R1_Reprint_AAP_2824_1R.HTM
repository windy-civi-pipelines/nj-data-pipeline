separately, by source and amount, and remain in the fund until appropriated for
such purposes.  The fund shall be the repository of all State funds
appropriated for affordable housing purposes, including, but not limited to,
the proceeds from the receipts of the additional fee collected pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-7),

may be dedicated, earmarked, or appropriated by the Legislature for the
purposes of the fund.  All references in any law, order, rule, regulation,
contract, loan, document, or otherwise, to the &quot;Neighborhood Preservation
Nonlapsing Revolving Fund&quot; shall mean the &quot;New Jersey Affordable
Housing Trust Fund.&quot;  The department shall be permitted to utilize
annually up to 7.5 percent of the monies available in the fund for the payment
of any necessary administrative costs related to the administration of the
