<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 1 of P.L.2005,
c.251 (C.17:48-6ee) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    A hospital service
corporation that provides hospital or medical expense benefits for expenses
incurred in the purchase of outpatient prescription drugs under a contract
shall provide coverage under every such contract delivered, issued, executed or
renewed in this State or approved for issuance or renewal in this State by the
Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, on or after the effective date of this
act, for expenses incurred in the purchase of prescription female
contraceptives <u>and, regardless of whether coverage for outpatient
prescription drugs are provided, for male sterilization procedures</u>.  For
the purposes of this section, &quot;prescription female contraceptives&quot;
means any drug or device used for contraception by a female, which is approved
by the federal Food and Drug Administration for that purpose, that can only be
purchased in this State with a prescription written by a health care
professional licensed or authorized to write prescriptions, and includes, but is
not limited to, birth control pills and diaphragms.  The coverage provided
shall include prescriptions for dispensing contraceptives for:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     a three-month period
for the first dispensing of the contraceptive; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    a six-month period for
any subsequent dispensing of the same contraceptive, regardless of whether
coverage under the contract was in effect at the time of the first dispensing,
except that an entity subject to this section may provide coverage for a supply
of contraceptives that is for less than a six-month period, if a six-month
period would extend beyond the term of the contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A religious employer may
request, and a hospital service corporation shall grant, an exclusion under the
contract for the coverage required by this section if the required coverage
conflicts with the religious employer's bona fide religious beliefs and
practices.  A religious employer that obtains such an exclusion shall provide
written notice thereof to prospective subscribers and subscribers.  The
provisions of this section shall not be construed as authorizing a hospital
service corporation to exclude coverage for prescription drugs that are
prescribed for reasons other than contraceptive purposes or for prescription
female contraceptives that are necessary to preserve the life or health of a
subscriber.  For the purposes of this section, &quot;religious employer&quot;
means an employer that is a church, convention or association of churches or an
elementary or secondary school that is controlled, operated or principally supported
by a church or by a convention or association of churches as defined in 26
U.S.C.s.3121(w)(3)(A), and that qualifies as a tax-exempt organization under 26
U.S.C.s.501(c)(3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The benefits shall be provided
to the same extent as for any other outpatient prescription drug under the
contract<u>, except no deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or any other cost-sharing
requirement on the coverage shall be imposed.  In the case of a high-deductible
health plan, the limitation on cost-sharing shall not be applied until the
expenditures applicable to the deductible under the plan have met the amount of
the minimum annual deductibles in effect under section 223(c)(2)(A)(i) of the
federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 223(c)(2)(A)(i)) for self-only and
family coverage, respectively. Once the foregoing expenditure amount has been
met under the plan, coverage for the benefits shall be provided without
cost-sharing as provided in this section</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This section shall apply to
those contracts in which the hospital service corporation has reserved the
right to change the premium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2017, c.241, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 2 of P.L.2005,
c.251 (C.17:48A-7bb) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    A medical service
corporation that provides hospital or medical expense benefits for expenses
incurred in the purchase of outpatient prescription drugs under a contract
shall provide coverage under every such contract delivered, issued, executed or
renewed in this State or approved for issuance or renewal in this State by the
Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, on or after the effective date of this

contraceptives <u>and, regardless of whether coverage for outpatient

c.251 (C.52:14-17.29j) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  The State Health Benefits
Commission shall ensure that every contract purchased by the commission on or
after the effective date of this act that provides benefits for expenses
incurred in the purchase of outpatient prescription drugs shall provide
benefits for expenses incurred in the purchase of prescription female
contraceptives<span style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;letter-spacing:0pt'> </span><u>and,
regardless of whether coverage for outpatient prescription drugs are provided,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
section, &quot;prescription female contraceptives&quot; means any drug or
device used for contraception by a female, which is approved by the federal
Food and Drug Administration for that purpose, that can only be purchased in
this State with a prescription written by a health care professional licensed
or authorized to write prescriptions, and includes, but is not limited to,
birth control pills and diaphragms.  The coverage provided shall include
prescriptions for dispensing contraceptives for:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     a three-month period
for the first dispensing of the contraceptive; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    a six-month period for
any subsequent dispensing of the same contraceptive, regardless of whether
coverage under the contract was in effect at the time of the first dispensing,
except that an entity subject to this section may provide coverage for a supply
of contraceptives that is for less than a six-month period, if a six-month
period would extend beyond the term of the contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The contract shall specify
that no deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or any other cost-sharing
requirement may be imposed on the coverage required pursuant to this section.  In
the case of a high-deductible health plan, the limitation on cost-sharing shall
not be applied until the expenditures applicable to the deductible under the
plan have met the amount of the minimum annual deductibles in effect under
section 223(c)(2)(A)(i) of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.
223(c)(2)(A)(i)) for self-only and family coverage, respectively. Once the
foregoing expenditure amount has been met under the plan, coverage for the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends P.L.2005,
c.251, the statute requiring health insurance carriers and the State health
benefits programs to cover prescription female contraceptives, by also
requiring coverage for male sterilization procedures and by prohibiting
insurers from imposing a deductible, coinsurance, copayment, or any other
cost-sharing requirement on these coverages.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, federal law
requires coverage for female contraceptives to be provided without cost sharing
in certain circumstances. This bill would expand State law to also require
coverage for female contraceptives and male sterilization procedures to be
provided without cost sharing.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also specifies that,
in the case of a high deductible health plan, the limitation on cost-sharing
shall not be applied until the expenditures applicable to the deductible under
federal law have been met. Once the foregoing expenditure amount has been met
under the plan, coverage for prescription female contraceptives and male sterilization
procedures benefits is to be provided without cost-sharing.</p>
