(cf: P.L.1977, c.419, s.18) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill implements one of the recommendations of the State Commission of Investigation in its report of March, 2005 entitled The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: New-Home Construction in New Jersey.  Specifically, this bill clarifies that the Commissioner of Community Affairs has authority to enforce the provisions of "The Planned Real Estate Development Full Disclosure Act" against planned real estate development builders.
