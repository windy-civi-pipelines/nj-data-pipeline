S3413 SENATE, No. 3413 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 10, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  JOSEPH P. CRYAN District 20 (Union) Senator  KRISTIN M. CORRADO District 40 (Bergen, Essex and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Authorizes grocery stores to provide certain single-use paper carryout bags to customers. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning paper carryout bags and amending P.L.2020, c.117. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 1 of P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126) is amended to read as follows: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that, since 1950, global annual production of plastics has increased from two million tons to over 381 million tons; that approximately one third of all plastics produced are single-use plastics, which are plastics designed to be used only once and then thrown away; and that an estimated 100 billion single-use plastic carryout bags and 25 billion styrofoam plastic coffee cups are thrown away in the United States each year. The Legislature further finds that, in 2017, only 8.4 percent of plastics in the United States were recycled; that most single-use plastics are disposed of in landfills, are incinerated, or become litter in waterways and oceans; that plastics released in the environment do not biodegrade, but instead break down into smaller pieces, known as microplastics, which accumulate in the natural environment and are eaten by fish and other marine life; and that microplastic pollution moves through natural food webs and accumulates in fish and shellfish tissues, which means microplastics and associated pollutants can move into the food chain. The Legislature further finds that approximately eight million tons of plastic end up in the oceans annually; that, without action, scientists estimate that by 2050 the mass of plastic pollution in the ocean will exceed the mass of fish; that currently, there is a collection of litter in the North Pacific Ocean, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, that is 7.7 million square miles and is composed primarily of plastics; that one study found plastics in the gut of every sea turtle examined and in 90 percent of seabirds examined; and that plastics have been known to cause death or reproductive failure in sea turtles, birds, and other organisms that ingest plastic. The Legislature further finds that, as plastics break down through photodegradation, they release harmful chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA) into the environment that have been linked to health problems in humans; that these chemicals enter the food chain when consumed by marine life; and that single-use plastic waste creates visual pollution, degrades water quality, and impacts the tourism, fishing, and shipping industries, all of which are major contributors to the New Jersey economy. The Legislature therefore determines that it is no longer conscionable to permit the unfettered use and disposal of single-use plastics in the State; that New Jersey must do its part to minimize plastic pollution in the ocean, and to ensure that future generations have a clean and healthy environment to live, work, and recreate in; that banning or limiting the use of single-use plastic carryout bags, polystyrene foam food service products, and single-use plastic straws is a significant step in this effort, as these items are among the most significant sources of beach and ocean pollution; that New Jersey joins several other states and hundreds of municipalities across the country in banning or limiting the use of single-use plastics; and that such bans and limitations have drastically lowered consumer consumption of single-use plastics. The Legislature further finds that single-use paper carryout bags use as much or more energy and resources to manufacture and transport than single-use plastic carryout bags and contribute to harmful air emissions.  Consequently, the Legislature further determines that it is in the public interest to prohibit grocery stores from providing single-use paper carryout bags , unless they contain a significant quantity of postconsumer recycled content. The Legislature further finds that the State's nascent hemp-growing industry, regulated through the New Jersey Department of Agriculture's Division of Plant Industry, would be a significant force in creating biodegradable raw materials that can be turned into hemp-based bio-packaging, which breaks down in approximately 90 days versus the dozens of years it takes petroleum-based plastics to break down into microplastics in the ocean. (cf:  P.L.2020, c.117, s.1) 2.    Section 2 of P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.127) is amended to read as follows: 2.    As used in P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.): "Carryout bag" means a bag that is provided by a store or food service business to a customer for the purpose of transporting groceries, prepared foods, or retail goods.

"Grocery store" shall not include an establishment that handles only prepackaged food that does not require time or temperature controls for food safety. "Hemp product" means a finished product with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent that is derived from or made by processing a hemp plant or plant part and prepared in a form available for commercial sale. "Person" means any individual, corporation, company, association, society, firm, partnership, joint stock company, or governmental entity. "Plastic" means a synthetic material made from linking monomers through a chemical reaction to create an organic polymer chain that can be molded or extruded at high heat into various solid forms retaining their defined shapes during the life cycle and after disposal. "Polystyrene foam" means blown polystyrene and expanded and extruded foams that are thermoplastic petrochemical materials utilizing a styrene monomer and processed by a number of techniques, including, but not limited to, fusion of polymer spheres (expandable bead polystyrene), injection molding, foam molding, and extrusion-blow molding (extruded foam polystyrene).

"Sustainable paper carryout bag" means a single-use paper carryout bag that meets or exceeds the postconsumer recycled content requirements of section 6 of P.L.2021, c.391 (C.13:1E-99.140). (cf:  P.L.2020, c.117, s.2) 3.  Section 3 of P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.128) is amended to read as follows: 3. a. Beginning 18 months after the effective date of P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.): (1)   no store or food service business shall provide or sell a single-use plastic carryout bag to a customer; and (2)   no grocery store shall provide or sell a single-use paper carryout bag that is not a sustainable paper carryout bag to a customer. b.    A municipality or county shall not adopt any rule, regulation, code, or ordinance concerning the regulation or prohibition of single-use plastic carryout bags or single-use paper carryout bags after the effective date of P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.). c.     Beginning 18 months after the effective date of P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.), this section shall supersede and preempt any municipal or county rule, regulation, code, or ordinance concerning the regulation or prohibition of single-use plastic carryout bags or single-use paper carryout bags that was enacted prior to the effective date of P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.). d.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section to the contrary, beginning 24 months after the effective date of P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.), no food bank or food pantry shall provide a single-use plastic carryout bag to a customer.

"Food pantry" means a nonprofit organization or government entity that distributes food to individuals in need of assistance, including, but not limited to, a soup kitchen, homeless shelter, or religious organization. (cf:  P.L.2022, c.6, s.1) 4. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et seq.) to authorize grocery stores to provide single-use paper carryout bags to their customers, provided that the bags contain a certain percentage of postconsumer recycled content.  Specifically, the bags would be required to meet or exceed the postconsumer recycled content requirements of section 6 of P.L.2021, c.391 (C.13:1E-99.140).  Under that section of law, paper carryout bags are required to contain, on average, at least 40 percent postconsumer recycled content; except that a paper carryout bag that holds eight pounds or less is required to contain, on average, at least 20 percent postconsumer recycled content.
