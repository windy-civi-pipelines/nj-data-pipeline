STATEMENT This bill establishes a 10 year Menstrual Leave and Remote Work Pilot Program.  The purpose of this program is to provide medically necessary leave and remote work options to employees suffering from menstrual disorders, which can be severe, debilitating, and embarrassing.  To be eligible for the program, an employee is required to obtain documentation from the employees treating physician that the employee suffers from a qualifying menstrual disorder and requires an accommodation of leave or a remote work option, as appropriate. The pilot program is divided into the following two components: (1) a medical leave program into which an employer may voluntarily enroll to provide up to two full working days per month of fully paid medical leave, in addition to any other leave required by law, to employees suffering from qualifying menstrual disorders, including, but not limited to: (a)   Uterine fibroids; (b)   Endometriosis; (c)   Polycystic ovary syndrome; and (d)   Adenomyosis; and (2)   a remote work program into which an employer may voluntarily enroll to provide up to two full days per month that an employee may work remotely to accommodate symptoms arising from qualifying menstrual disorders, including, but not limited to: (a)   Uterine fibroids; (b)   Endometriosis; (c)   Polycystic ovary syndrome; (d)   Adenomyosis; (e)   Premenstrual syndrome; (f)   Premenstrual dysphoric disorder; (g)   Dysmenorrhea; and (h)   Menorrhagia. Under each program, a participating employer will be entitled to tax credits for wages paid to employees. For the medical leave program, employers will be entitled to a dollar for dollar tax credit for wages paid to employees in the program up to two full days each month.  For the remote work program, employers will be entitled to a tax credit equal to 25 percent of the wages paid to employees in the program up to two full days each month. Any personnel action or discrimination taken by an employer against an employee for using or requesting medical leave in accordance or working or requesting to work remotely in accordance with this bill, will be regarded as a violation of the earned sick leave law and subject to the penalties in that law.
