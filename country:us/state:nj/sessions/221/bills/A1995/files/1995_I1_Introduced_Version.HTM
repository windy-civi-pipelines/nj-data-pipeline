Program and supplementing various parts of the statutory law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a. There is established in
the Department of Labor and Workforce Development a 10 year Menstrual Leave and
Remote Work Pilot Program.  The purpose of this program is to provide medically
necessary leave and remote work options to employees suffering from menstrual
disorders, which can be severe, debilitating, and embarrassing.  To be eligible
for the program, an employee shall be required to obtain documentation from the
employees treating physician that the employee suffers from a qualifying
menstrual disorder and requires an accommodation of leave or a remote work
option, as appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The program is divided
into the following two components:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) A medical leave program
into which an employer may voluntarily enroll to provide up to two full working
days per month of fully paid medical leave, in addition to any other leave
required by law, to employees suffering from qualifying menstrual disorders,
including, but not limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   Uterine fibroids;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Endometriosis;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Polycystic ovary
syndrome; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Adenomyosis; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A remote work program
into which an employer may voluntarily enroll to provide up to two full days
per month that an employee may work remotely to accommodate symptoms arising
from qualifying menstrual disorders, including, but not limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   Uterine fibroids;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Endometriosis;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Polycystic ovary
syndrome; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Adenomyosis;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   Premenstrual syndrome;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   Premenstrual dysphoric
disorder;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   Dysmenorrhea; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)   Menorrhagia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     An employer providing
fully paid medical leave in accordance to paragraph (1) of subsection b. of
this section shall be eligible for a tax credit pursuant to sections 2 through
of 5 of <br>
P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)
equal to the amount of wages paid to each employee for this medical leave, up
to two days per month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    An employer providing a
remote work option in accordance with paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this
section shall be eligible for a tax credit pursuant to sections 6 through of 9
of P.L.    , <br>
c.    (C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending before
the Legislature as this bill) equal to 25 percent of the wages paid to each
employee for the time the employee spends working remotely, up to two days per
month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     During the pendency of
the pilot program, an employer participating in the program, whether for leave
or remote work, or both, shall be subject to the employee protections in
section 4 of P.L.2018, c.10 (C.34:11D-4).  Any personnel action or
discrimination taken by an employer against an employee for using or requesting
medical leave in accordance with paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section
or working or requesting to work remotely in accordance with paragraph (2) of
subsection b. of this section shall constitute a violation of P.L.2018, c.10
(C.34:11D-1 et seq.), and shall be regarded as a failure to meet the wage
payment requirements of the &quot;New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law,&quot;
P.L.1966, c.113 (C.34:11-56a et seq.), or other violation of that act, as the case
may be, and remedies, penalties, and other measures provided by that act,
R.S.34:11-58, and section 10 of P.L.1999, c.90 (C.2C:40A-2) for failure to pay
wages or other violations of that act shall be applicable, including, but not
limited to, penalties provided pursuant to sections 23 and 25 of that act
(C.34:11-56a22 and 34:11-56a24), and civil actions by employees pursuant to
section 26 of that act (C.34:11-56a25), except that an award to an employee in
a civil act shall include, in addition to the amount provided pursuant to
section 26 of that act (C.34:11-56a25), any actual damages suffered by the
employee as the result of the violation plus an equal amount of liquidated
damages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The Commissioner of
Labor and Workforce Development shall adopt rules and regulations pursuant to
the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et
seq.) to effectuate the purposes of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a. There is established
in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development a program, administered by
the commissioner, to provide tax credits to employers that provide fully paid
medical leave for up to two full working days per month, in addition to the
earned sick leave that is required to be paid pursuant to P.L.2018, c10
(C.34:11D-1 et seq.), to employees suffering from menstrual disorders in
accordance with paragraph (1) of subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.    , c.   
(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The purpose of the
program is to provide tax credits to these employers to offset the cost to the
employer of wages paid to employees using the time provided by the employer. </p>
