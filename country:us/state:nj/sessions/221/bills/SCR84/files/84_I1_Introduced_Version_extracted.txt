BUCCO District 25 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Urges U.S. Secretary for Housing and Urban Development to prioritize transitional housing for homeless individuals and families, including survivors of domestic violence. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Concurrent Resolution urging the United States Secretary for Housing and Urban Development to prioritize transitional housing for homeless individuals and families, including survivors of domestic violence. Whereas, Homelessness is defined as any individual or family who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; is in imminent risk of losing their primary nighttime residence; is considered homeless under federal statutes; or is fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence (DV); and Whereas, DV is defined as violent or aggressive behavior within the home, usually perpetrated by the violent abuse of a spouse or partner; and Whereas, Those who have experienced DV often face long-term physical and mental health issues stemming from their abuse; and Whereas, Finding new housing provides a pathway for victims of DV to escape their abusers, many often encounter financial barriers that prevent them from obtaining or maintaining safe and affordable permanent housing; and Whereas, Most emergency shelters do not allow homeless individuals and families, including those fleeing DV, to stay for more than 90 days; and Whereas, More than half of DV victims who identified a need for housing services did not receive them; and Whereas, Transitional housing programs provide safe harbor for homeless individuals and families, with housing for up to 24 months and support services that include financial education, life skills training, counseling, employment, and housing assistance; and Whereas, Transitional housing is particularly important to DV victims, who need the time and support that transitional housing provides in order to obtain and maintain permanent affordable housing; and Whereas, The coronavirus 2019 pandemic has further exacerbated the struggle that homeless individuals and families face in obtaining and maintaining stable housing, especially in high-rent communities where other forms of short-term rental assistance are inadequate for long term stability; now, therefore: Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey (the General Assembly concurring): 1.    The Legislature of the State of New Jersey urges the United States Secretary for Housing and Urban Development to prioritize transitional housing for homeless individuals and families, including those fleeing domestic violence. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. STATEMENT This resolution urges the United States Secretary for Housing and Urban Development to prioritize transitional housing for homeless individuals and families, including survivors of domestic violence (DV). Homelessness presents a variety of needs and challenges, and for many, time and support is needed to obtain and maintain permanent and affordable housing.  For victims of DV, who often face physical and mental health issues stemming from their abuse, financial barriers often prevent them from obtaining such housing. Transitional housing programs allow homeless households, including those who have fled DV, up to 24 months of safe housing and supportive services that include financial education, life skills training, counseling, employment support, and housing assistance.  Transitional housing is particularly important for DV victims, who need time and support in order to obtain and maintain permanent affordable housing. Over the past year, the coronavirus 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) has further exacerbated the need for transitional housing programs, with millions of Americans crippled with unemployment, underemployment, and uncertainty.  In high-rent communities, homeless households recovering from the financial impacts of COVID-19 will need time to regain employment, locate suitable childcare, pay off debts and repair credit, before they will be able to obtain new housing.  Transitional housing programs are equipped to provide the time and resources that it will take to get households back on their feet permanently. Urging the Secretary for Housing and Urban Development to prioritize transitional housing can provide homeless individuals and families, including survivors of DV, with the opportunity to achieve financial self-sufficiency and safe, permanent housing.
