A918 ASSEMBLY, No. 918 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  VERLINA REYNOLDS-JACKSON District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) Assemblyman  REGINALD W. ATKINS District 20 (Union) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblyman Rodriguez SYNOPSIS Establishes Employer-Based Child Care Assistance Partnership Program in DCF. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act establishing an employer-based child care assistance partnership program and supplementing P.L.1983, c.492 (C.30:5B-1 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  One of the primary barriers for parents seeking to enter the workforce is lack of access to affordable child care. b.  According to McKinseys American Opportunity Survey, an online survey which was released in May of 2021, only 39 percent of respondents who had incomes below $50,000 and children at home said they could afford child care. c.  Although the lack of affordable child care was a barrier for many working parents long before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting public health emergency, the pandemic required these parents to juggle jobs and caregiving responsibilities when child care centers closed or pandemic-related restrictions limited the number of children the centers were allowed to serve. d.  A 2020 survey conducted by Care@Work of 1,000 working parents with children under the age of 15 showed that 73 percent were considering making major changes at work, such as revising their schedules (44 percent), looking for a different job (21 percent), or leaving the workforce entirely (15 percent), so the parents could focus on providing child care. e.  Working women are most adversely affected by the lack of accessible child care.  Although women make up less than half of the nations workforce, they accounted for a majority of the decrease in the labor force during the first year of the pandemic.  Data gathered by the Pew Research Center showed that between February 2020 and February 2021, 2.4 million women left the workforce, compared with 1.8 million men. f.  Businesses have a vested interest in ensuring that their employees can access and afford child care. When companies offer child care benefits, they see increased employee retention and loyalty, improved productivity, and a better workplace environment.  Despite the clear advantages, in 2020, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated just 11 percent of all workers had access to employer-provided child care, and those with lower incomes were less likely to receive child care benefits. g.  Offering benefits such as the subsidization of child care for a companys employees or the establishment of employer-provided spending accounts designed to cover the cost, in part or in full, of child care-related expenses, can remove a major barrier to workforce participation and help attract and retain employees with children. h.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the State to establish an employer-based child care assistance partnership program that incentivizes employers to contribute to an employees child care costs, encourages the State to provide matching funds against such contributions to make child care more affordable for working parents, and ensures that the children of this State have access to high-quality child care services. 2.  As used in this act: Child care provider means a licensed child care center or a registered family child care provider which has achieved a Grow NJ Kids rating of at least three. Contribution means a direct payment made by an employer or through a third-party vendor to a child care provider to subsidize an employees eligible child care costs. Department means the Department of Children and Families. Eligible child care costs means any cost incurred by a person for services rendered by a child care provider. Employee means a person engaged in service to an employer in the business of the employer for compensation. Employer means any person, firm, business, educational institution, nonprofit agency, corporation, limited liability company or other entity that employs employees in the State. Fund means the Employer-Based Child Care Assistance Partnership Fund established pursuant to section 6 of this act. Grow NJ Kids means New Jerseys quality rating improvement system designed to raise the quality of child care and early learning programs. Program means the Employer-Based Child Care Assistance Partnership Program established pursuant to section 3 of this act. State match means a direct payment made to a child care provider by the Department of Children and Families from the Employer-Based Child Care Assistance Partnership Program Fund pursuant to section 6 of this act. State median household income means the most recent estimate available of real median house income for the State of New Jersey, as determined by the United States Census Bureau, and adjusted for family size. 3. a.  There is established the Employer-Based Child Care Assistance Partnership Program in the Department of Children and Families.  The purpose of the program shall be to incentivize employers to contribute to an employees child care costs, for the State to provide matching funds against such contributions, and to ensure that for working parents of this State and their children have access to affordable, high-quality child care services.  Participation in the program shall be voluntary. b.  The department shall: (1) regulate and oversee the activities associated with the program; (2) prepare, make available, and process an application and standardized certification form to be used by an employer to enter into an agreement with an employee and the employees child care provider to contribute to the employees child care costs pursuant to section 4 of this act, which certification form shall include the: (a)   name, address, and size of the employer; (b)   name and telephone number of the person who will be the point of contact for the employer regarding compliance with the provisions of this act; (c)   name, address, and telephone number of the employee who will be receiving child care assistance from the employer pursuant to section 4 of this act; (d)   name and address of the employees child care provider; (e)   name and telephone number of the person who will be the point of contact for the child care provider regarding compliance with the provisions of this act; (f)   total amount and frequency of the contribution to be paid by the employer to the employees child care provider; (g)   total amount and frequency of a co-payment to be paid by an employee to the employees child care provider, if applicable; and (h) duration of the agreement entered into by the employer, employee, and the employees child care provider; (3) develop procedures for the notification of an employer, an employee, and an employees child care provider of the employers, employees, and employees child care providers enrollment in the program; (4) establish eligibility requirements that an employer, employee, and child care provider shall meet in order for the department to enter into an agreement to match the contribution made by an employer to an employees child care costs; (5) establish security procedures to protect the confidentiality of the personal information of employers, employees, and child care providers participating in the program; (6)   enter into partnership agreements with employers participating in the program to provide State matching funds against the contributions made by the employer to employee child care costs pursuant to section 4 of this act; (7) manage and administer the funds deposited in the Employer-Based Child Care Assistance Partnership Program Fund established pursuant to section 6 of this act, including, but not limited to, the development of an automated payment system for the disbursement of such funds; (8) establish procedures for collecting and verifying household income information from an employee participating in the program, which information shall be used to determine the amount of State matching funds for which the employee is eligible;

(2) The department shall make the standardized certification form available on the departments Internet website for the employer to access whenever an employee wishes to receive child care assistance from the employer as a benefit of employment. e.  The department shall review each certification submitted pursuant to subsection d. of this section and shall enroll the employee in the program and commence direct payments to the child care provider consistent with the agreement and in accordance with section 6 of this act, unless the department finds the agreement deficient, which deficiency may include, but is not limited to:  the employer is not enrolled in the program; the child care provider is not enrolled in the program, has not submitted an application to enroll in the program pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection c. of this section, or has had the providers application denied by the department; the child care provider does not have a Grow NJ rating of three or higher; or the parties to the agreement do not otherwise meet the requirements of this act.  The department will provide the employer, the employee, and the child care provider of the employees enrollment in the program and the amount of matching funds that will be provided under the program, or the departments determination that the certification is deficient, along with the specific deficiency and the steps needed to cure the deficiency, if applicable. f.     An employee participating in the program shall be responsible for the balance of any child care costs that exceed the amount of the contribution made by the employees employer under a certification submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection d. of this section and the State matching funds provided against such contribution by the department. 5.  a.  An agreement to contribute to an employees child care costs entered between an employer, an employee, and the employees child care provider pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection d. of section 4 of this act shall be terminated under the following circumstances: (1)   if an employee is terminated, laid off, furloughed, or otherwise separated from employment with the employer; (2) if the employer fails to make direct payments to the employees child care provider in accordance with the amount and frequency of the contribution agreed upon by the employer, employee, and the employees child care provider as documented in the certification form submitted to the department pursuant to subsection d. of section 4 of this act; (3)   if an employee fails to pay the employees child care provider for the balance of the costs not covered by the contribution made by the employer to the employees child care costs and the State matching funds provided against the employers contribution pursuant to subsection f. of section 4 of this act; (4)   if the employees child care provider ceases its participation in, or if the department denies, suspends, revokes, or refuses to renew the providers rating under, the Grow New Jersey quality rating improvement system; or (5) the employer or child care provider disenrolls from the program. b.  (1) If an employer fails to make a direct payment to an employees child care provider in accordance with the amount and frequency of the contribution agreed upon by the employer, employee, and the employees child care provider as documented in the certification form submitted to the department pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection d. of section 4 of this act, the employees child care provider shall notify the employer, employee, and the department within five days of the employers failure to make the direct payments.  Upon receipt of such notification, the department shall: (a)  temporarily cease the provision of matching State funds against the contribution made by the employer to the employees child care costs; and (b) notify the employer that the agreement entered into between the employer, employee, and the employees child care provider as documented in the certification form submitted to the department pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection d. of section 4 of this act, will be terminated unless the employer makes any delinquent payments and certifies that that the employer will resume the direct payments within five days of receipt of the notification.

STATEMENT This bill establishes the Employer-Based Child Care Assistance Partnership Program in the Department of Children and Families (DCF).  The purpose of the program is to incentivize employers to contribute to employee child care costs by providing State funds for such contributions in order to ensure that the working parents of this State and their children have access to affordable, high-quality child care services. Participation in the program will be voluntary, and the DCF is to regulate and oversee the activities associated with the program. Under the bill, an employer who wishes to provide child care assistance to an employee under the program and a child care provider seeking to participate in the program will submit a one-time application to the DCF, which will enroll the employer or child care provider in the program.  Upon enrollment, the employer may enroll employees by submitting a standardized certification form to the DCF that includes, among other things, the amount of employers contribution to the employees child care provider.  The amount of State matching funds will be based on the employees household income. If the total amount of the employer contribution and State matching funds do not cover the employees total child care costs, the employee will be responsible for the balance of the costs. The bill sets forth certain circumstances under which participation in the program will be terminated, including the failure by the employer to make a contribution payment, the failure of the employee to pay the balance of child care costs not covered under the program, a child care provider ceasing to qualify for the program, or voluntary termination by the employer or employee. The bill creates in the Department of the Treasury a dedicated,  non-lapsing fund, to be known as the Employer-Based Child Care Assistance Partnership Fund.  The fund will be the repository for monies made available to implement the provisions established in the bill.  All monies expended for the purpose of providing State matching funds against contributions made employers to employee child care costs are to be paid from the fund. The bill also requires the DCF to issue a report about the programs efficacy within one year after the program is established, and annually thereafter, to the Governor and to the Legislature.  The report is to be posted on the DCFs website and made available to the public upon request.

STATEMENT This bill establishes the Employer-Based Child Care Assistance Partnership Program in the Department of Children and Families (DCF).  The purpose of the program is to incentivize employers to contribute to employee child care costs by providing State funds for such contributions in order to ensure that the working parents of this State and their children have access to affordable, high-quality child care services. Participation in the program will be voluntary, and the DCF is to regulate and oversee the activities associated with the program. Under the bill, an employer who wishes to provide child care assistance to an employee under the program and a child care provider seeking to participate in the program will submit a one-time application to the DCF, which will enroll the employer or child care provider in the program.  Upon enrollment, the employer may enroll employees by submitting a standardized certification form to the DCF that includes, among other things, the amount of employers contribution to the employees child care provider.  The amount of State matching funds will be based on the employees household income. If the total amount of the employer contribution and State matching funds do not cover the employees total child care costs, the employee will be responsible for the balance of the costs. The bill sets forth certain circumstances under which participation in the program will be terminated, including the failure by the employer to make a contribution payment, the failure of the employee to pay the balance of child care costs not covered under the program, a child care provider ceasing to qualify for the program, or voluntary termination by the employer or employee. The bill creates in the Department of the Treasury a dedicated,  non-lapsing fund, to be known as the Employer-Based Child Care Assistance Partnership Fund.  The fund will be the repository for monies made available to implement the provisions established in the bill.  All monies expended for the purpose of providing State matching funds against contributions made employers to employee child care costs are to be paid from the fund. The bill also requires the DCF to issue a report about the programs efficacy within one year after the program is established, and annually thereafter, to the Governor and to the Legislature.  The report is to be posted on the DCFs website and made available to the public upon request.
