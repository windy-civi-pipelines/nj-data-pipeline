An Act concerning cost of living increases for certain retired members and beneficiaries of the Police and Firemens Retirement System and supplementing P.L.1958, c.143 (C.43:3B-1 et seq.) and making an appropriation. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  a.  (1)  An adjustment shall be granted in accordance with this section to the monthly retirement allowance or pension of a retired member, and the monthly pension or survivorship benefit of a surviving spouse, child, or beneficiary, that is provided by the Police and Firemen's Retirement System, established pursuant to P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-2 et seq.).             An adjustment shall be granted only if the amount of an allowance, pension, or benefit originally granted, without any prior cost of living adjustments that had been provided, was at or below 450 percent of the federal poverty level as set for a household of one for the calendar year in which this act, P.L.    , c.      (C.               )(pending before the Legislature as this bill), becomes effective. (2)  An adjustment shall be granted in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection to a retired member who is receiving a retirement allowance or pension, other than for accidental or ordinary disability, only if the retired member has attained the age of 62 years as of January 1 of the calendar year following the effective date of this act. (3)  An adjustment shall be granted in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection to any other retired member, surviving spouse, child, or beneficiary regardless of age. b.  An adjustment shall be granted only on January 1 of the calendar year following the effective date of this act and on January 1 of the following calendar year.  The adjustment granted in the second calendar year shall be provided in each calendar year thereafter in the same amount. c.  As used in this section CPI-W means the annual average over a 12-month period beginning September 1 and ending August 31 of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), All Items Series A, of the United States Department of Labor, for the NY-Northeastern New Jersey region.

For the purposes of calculating the percentage of the CPI-W, the maximum CPI-W shall be three percent and the minimum shall be one percent.

(2) The Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemens Retirement System shall certify for each calendar year to the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury the amount necessary to pay for the cost of the adjustments in retirement allowances, pensions, and survivorship benefits granted in accordance with this section and for necessary administrative costs. e.  A retired member, surviving spouse, child, or beneficiary who is eligible to receive the adjustment to the retirement allowance, pension, or benefit in accordance with this section may waive, at any time, the right thereto by filing a written notice of waiver with the Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemens Retirement System.
