A residency requirement adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall not apply to any person who on the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) is member of a police department or force or a member of a fire department or force who becomes a member of a regional police department or force or a regional fire department or force, or a joint meeting for law enforcement or fire protection, after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), unless the member is already a resident of the region served by his employer on the effective date of P.L. , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     If the governing body of a municipality in which a joint meeting or regional service agency has applied for the location and erection of sewage treatment or solid waste disposal facilities refuses permission therefor, or fails to take final action upon the application within 60 days of its filing, the joint meeting or regional service agency may, at any time within 30 days following the date of such refusal or the date of expiration of the 60-day period, apply to the Department of Environmental Protection for relief.  That department is authorized, after hearing the joint meeting or regional service agency and the interested municipality, to grant the application for the erection of the sewage treatment or disposal or solid waste treatment or disposal facilities, notwithstanding the refusal or failure to act of the municipal governing body, upon being satisfied that the topographical and other physical conditions existing in the local units comprising the joint meeting or regional service agency are such as to make the erection of such facilities within its boundaries impracticable as an improvement for the benefit of the whole applying joint meeting or regional service agency. (cf: P.L.2019, c.433, s.7) 8. (New section)  Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, a residency requirement adopted as part of a shared service agreement or a joint contract among local units for law enforcement or fire protection shall not apply to any person who on the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) is member of a police department or force or a member of a fire department or force that is a party to a shared service or joint contract for such services after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), unless the member is already a resident of a local unit served by the shared service or joint contract on the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill). 9.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would permit a municipality to adopt an ordinance prohibiting an applicant from obtaining employment with the municipal police department, paid fire department, or part-paid fire department unless the applicant agrees to remain a resident of the municipality for the first five years of his employment.  The bill also permits this residency requirement to be established for county and regional police and fire forces.  Under the bill, the Commissioner of Community Affairs would have to approve such a requirement for a municipality or county before it may take effect.  In any local jurisdiction with such a requirement, the applicant would have six months from the date the applicant begins his or her official duties, following all requisite training, to relocate to the municipality, county, or region served by the force. The bill would allow an exception to this residency requirement if any member of the fire department or police department suffers injury, or a threat of injury, to his person, family, or property, committed by another who acts with purpose to: (1) intimidate the member because of his status as a member; (2) manipulate an investigation; or (3) otherwise influence the member to violate his official duty. The bill requires municipalities adopting municipal police department, paid fire department, or part-paid fire department residency requirements under the bill to establish incentives for residency within the municipality, as well as a tuition aid reimbursement program for municipal police department, paid fire department, and part-paid fire department members who complete the five-year residence requirement. The bill would prohibit the enforcement of a residency requirement adopted as part of a shared service agreement, a joint contract, the creation of a regional department, or a joint meeting among local units for law enforcement or fire protection with respect to a person who on the effective date of the bill is a member of a police department or force, or a member of a fire department or force that is a party to such an agreement or the creation of such a regional entity after the effective date of the bill, unless the person is already a resident of a local unit served by such an entity on the effective date of the bill.

(New section)  Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, a residency requirement adopted as part of a shared service agreement or a joint contract among local units for law enforcement or fire protection shall not apply to any person who on the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) is member of a police department or force or a member of a fire department or force that is a party to a shared service or joint contract for such services after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), unless the member is already a resident of a local unit served by the shared service or joint contract on the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill). 9.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would permit a municipality to adopt an ordinance prohibiting an applicant from obtaining employment with the municipal police department, paid fire department, or part-paid fire department unless the applicant agrees to remain a resident of the municipality for the first five years of his employment.  The bill also permits this residency requirement to be established for county and regional police and fire forces.  Under the bill, the Commissioner of Community Affairs would have to approve such a requirement for a municipality or county before it may take effect.  In any local jurisdiction with such a requirement, the applicant would have six months from the date the applicant begins his or her official duties, following all requisite training, to relocate to the municipality, county, or region served by the force. The bill would allow an exception to this residency requirement if any member of the fire department or police department suffers injury, or a threat of injury, to his person, family, or property, committed by another who acts with purpose to: (1) intimidate the member because of his status as a member; (2) manipulate an investigation; or (3) otherwise influence the member to violate his official duty. The bill requires municipalities adopting municipal police department, paid fire department, or part-paid fire department residency requirements under the bill to establish incentives for residency within the municipality, as well as a tuition aid reimbursement program for municipal police department, paid fire department, and part-paid fire department members who complete the five-year residence requirement. The bill would prohibit the enforcement of a residency requirement adopted as part of a shared service agreement, a joint contract, the creation of a regional department, or a joint meeting among local units for law enforcement or fire protection with respect to a person who on the effective date of the bill is a member of a police department or force, or a member of a fire department or force that is a party to such an agreement or the creation of such a regional entity after the effective date of the bill, unless the person is already a resident of a local unit served by such an entity on the effective date of the bill.
