Associations formed after the effective date of P.L.2023, c.214 (C.52:27D-132.2 et al.) shall undertake a reserve study as soon as practicable after the election of a majority of an executive board pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1983, c.30 (C.45:22A-47), but in no event shall such study be undertaken more than two years following the election of a majority of the executive board under section 5 of P.L.1983, c.30 (C.45:22A-47). c.  [A covered building owner, as defined in section 2 of P.L.2023, c.214 (C.52:27D-132.3),] An association of a planned real estate development shall ensure that a capital reserve study conducted pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by a licensed architect, engineer, or credentialed reserve specialist and that a capital reserve study be conducted and reviewed at least once every five years. d.  This section shall not apply to an association of a planned real estate development with less than $25,000 in total common area capital assets. e.  As used in sections 6 and 7 of P.L.2023, c.214 (C.45:22A-44.2 and C.45:22A-44.3): "Adequate" or "adequacy" means the same as those terms are defined pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2023, c.214 (C.52:27D-132.3).

or (2)  fund the capital reserve fund in an amount equal to 85 percent of one of the capital reserve funding plans pursuant to paragraph (7) of subsection a. of section 6 of P.L.2023, c.214 (C.45:22A-44.2), and set forth in the most recent capital reserve study prepared on behalf of the association, provided that: (a)  prior to the adoption of an annual budget to fund the capital reserve fund account pursuant to this paragraph, the association shall provide a notice to all unit owners of the association in 20-point bold font, which specifies that the executive board of the association has elected to fund the capital reserve fund at 85 percent of the funding plan recommended by the associations 30-year capital reserve study and funding plan.  The notice shall provide the year in which a special assessment or loan is anticipated as a result of the reduced funding of the capital reserve fund, and the anticipated amount of the special assessment or loan that shall be required as a result of the decision by the executive board of the association; and (b)  prior to the execution of a contract for the purchase of a residential unit in the planned real estate development, the seller of the unit shall provide to the buyer a copy of the most recent notice provided to the unit owners of the association pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph. (3)  The funding method authorized pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not be utilized by an association for more than five fiscal years of the association next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill). f.     An association created after the effective date of P.L.2023, c.214 (C.52:27D-132.2 et al.) shall fund its capital reserve fund account in accordance with one of the capital reserve funding plans set forth in the associations most recent capital reserve study. (cf: P.L.2023, c.214, s.7) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill modifies certain requirements concerning the capital reserve study, 30-year funding plan, and capital reserve fund of an association of a planned real estate development (association), required by recently enacted law, P.L.2023, c.214 (C.52:27D-132.2 et al.). Specifically, the bill requires a proposed 30-year capital reserve funding plan or plans within a capital reserve study, required pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2023, c.214 (C.45:22A-44.3), to allow a capital reserve fund of an association to reach a dollar balance of zero during the 30-year funding plan projection.  The bill permits a capital reserve study to provide additional funding plans that have a minimum fund balance greater than zero, or funding plans with escalating annual contributions, provided the reserve fund balance is not projected to fall below zero dollars. Further, the bill defines the terms "adequate" and "adequacy" to mean a sum of money, however invested or held by an association of a planned real estate development, that, in accordance with the professional standards applied by the reserve specialist, architect, or engineer performing or overseeing the study, is sufficient so that the balance in the associations reserve fund will not fall below zero dollars as set forth in the associations 30-year funding plan, prepared as part of a reserve study. The bill requires an association of a planned real estate development, instead of a covered building owner, to ensure that a capital reserve study is reviewed by a licensed architect, engineer, or credentialed reserve specialist and that a capital reserve study is conducted and reviewed at least once every five years. The bill further requires: · an association existing as of January 8, 2024 to fund the reserve fund either: in accordance with the most recent reserve study and funding plan; or in an amount equal to 85 percent of one of the associations reserve funding plans; · if the association chooses to fund the reserve fund in an amount equal to 85 percent of the associations reserve funding plan, the association to provide certain notice to the unit owners and provide the year in which a special assessment or loan is anticipated as a result of the reduced funding of the reserve fund, and the amount of the anticipated special assessment or loan; and · the seller of a unit within an association that has elected to fund the reserve fund at 85 percent to provide to the buyer a copy of the most recent notice provided to the unit owners of the association concerning the associations decision to fund the reserve fund at 85 percent. The bill prohibits an association from funding the reserve fund at 85 percent for more than five fiscal years and specifies that an association created after January 8, 2024 is to fund the associations reserve fund in accordance with the capital reserve funding plan set forth in the associations most recent reserve study. Lastly, the bill removes certain language concerning an associations reserve fund from existing law.

Further, the bill defines the terms "adequate" and "adequacy" to mean a sum of money, however invested or held by an association of a planned real estate development, that, in accordance with the professional standards applied by the reserve specialist, architect, or engineer performing or overseeing the study, is sufficient so that the balance in the associations reserve fund will not fall below zero dollars as set forth in the associations 30-year funding plan, prepared as part of a reserve study. The bill requires an association of a planned real estate development, instead of a covered building owner, to ensure that a capital reserve study is reviewed by a licensed architect, engineer, or credentialed reserve specialist and that a capital reserve study is conducted and reviewed at least once every five years. The bill further requires: · an association existing as of January 8, 2024 to fund the reserve fund either: in accordance with the most recent reserve study and funding plan; or in an amount equal to 85 percent of one of the associations reserve funding plans; · if the association chooses to fund the reserve fund in an amount equal to 85 percent of the associations reserve funding plan, the association to provide certain notice to the unit owners and provide the year in which a special assessment or loan is anticipated as a result of the reduced funding of the reserve fund, and the amount of the anticipated special assessment or loan; and · the seller of a unit within an association that has elected to fund the reserve fund at 85 percent to provide to the buyer a copy of the most recent notice provided to the unit owners of the association concerning the associations decision to fund the reserve fund at 85 percent. The bill prohibits an association from funding the reserve fund at 85 percent for more than five fiscal years and specifies that an association created after January 8, 2024 is to fund the associations reserve fund in accordance with the capital reserve funding plan set forth in the associations most recent reserve study. Lastly, the bill removes certain language concerning an associations reserve fund from existing law.
