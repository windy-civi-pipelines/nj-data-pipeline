<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends current law
to make it easier for eligible claimants to file an application for the
homestead property tax reimbursement program.  This program is more commonly
known as the senior freeze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In pertinent part, P.L.1997,
c.348 limited eligibility for the homestead property tax reimbursement to senior
citizens and disabled persons who were eligible for the program of
pharmaceutical assistance to the aged and disabled (PAAD).  A claimants
eligibility to receive a homestead property tax reimbursement was based, in
part, on whether their income was within the limit used to determine
eligibility for PAAD.  This method of calculating income requires a claimant to
file a separate application for the homestead property tax reimbursement which
reports all source of income, including income they do not report on their New
Jersey gross income tax return.  This application process is often cumbersome
and confusing for senior freeze applicants.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that an
applicants gross income, as reported pursuant to the New Jersey Gross Income
Tax Act, would be used to determine their eligibility for a homestead property
tax reimbursement.  Using gross income to determine a claimants eligibility
for a homestead property tax reimbursement is intended to make the homestead
property tax reimbursement process less stressful because claimants will not
have to file a separate application to report their income and the Division of
Taxation will be able to determine a claimants eligibility by reviewing their
New Jersey gross income tax return. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires an
eligible claimant to file a property tax reimbursement application with their
New Jersey gross income tax return.  The bill permits the Director of the
Division of Taxation to establish alternate methods of submitting a property
tax reimbursement application if an eligible claimant is not required to file a
gross income tax return or if an eligible claimant is has filed an extension to
file their gross income tax return.  The bill also allows the Director of the
Division of Taxation to require the submittal of additional information
necessary to determine a claimants eligibility to receive a homestead property
tax reimbursement.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill takes effect
immediately but would not be operative until January 1, 2023 in order provide
the Division of Taxation time to update its processes for administering the
homestead property tax reimbursement program.</p>
