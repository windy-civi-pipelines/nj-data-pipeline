(cf:  P.L.1997, c.348, s.9) 3.  Section 3 of P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.70) is amended to read as follows: 3.    An application for a homestead property tax reimbursement hereunder shall be filed with the director annually beginning [April 1 and ending October 31] January 1 and ending April 15 of the year following the year for which the claim is being made [and].  The application shall be submitted (1) as part of the eligible claimants gross income tax return filed pursuant to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., or (2) on any other form, in any manner and at any time prior to any date the director shall prescribe if (a) the claimant is not required to file a gross income tax return or (b) the eligible claimant has filed an application for extension of time to file the claimants gross income tax return.  The application shall reflect the prerequisites for a homestead property tax reimbursement on December 31 of the tax year for which the claim is being made; provided, however, that the director may, by rule, designate a later date as the date by which the application shall be filed or waive the requirement for filing an annual application for any year or years subject to any limitations and conditions the director may deem appropriate. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the director and provided for the use of applicants hereunder.  Each applicant making a claim for a homestead property tax reimbursement under this act shall provide, if required by the director, to the director a copy of his or her current year property tax bill or current year site fee bill on the homestead constituting that person's principal residence and a copy of his or her property tax bill for the base year or site fee bill for the base year on the same homestead, or other equivalent proof as permitted by the director.  The director may require an eligible claimant to submit such additional information about the claimants age, annual gross income, and property address as well as any other information deemed necessary by the director in order to approve or disapprove the eligible claimants application.  The director may inspect all records in the offices of the tax collector and tax assessor of a municipality with respect to applications and claims for a homestead property reimbursement. It shall be the duty of every eligible claimant to inform the director of any change in his or her status or homestead which may affect his or her right to continuance of the homestead property tax reimbursement. If an eligible claimant receives an additional homestead property tax reimbursement to which the claimant was not entitled or greater than the reimbursement to which the claimant was entitled, the director shall permit the claimant to enter into an installment payment agreement for a reasonable period of time that will enable the claimant to completely satisfy the amount of the reimbursement paid to which the claimant was not entitled.  If the claimant does not enter into an installment payment agreement, the director may, in addition to all other available legal remedies, offset such amount against a gross income tax refund or amount due pursuant to P.L.1990, c.61. (cf: P.L.2017, c.370) 4. This act shall take effect immediately and shall be operative as of January 1, 2023. STATEMENT This bill amends current law to make it easier for eligible claimants to file an application for the homestead property tax reimbursement program.  This program is more commonly known as the senior freeze. In pertinent part, P.L.1997, c.348 limited eligibility for the homestead property tax reimbursement to senior citizens and disabled persons who were eligible for the program of pharmaceutical assistance to the aged and disabled (PAAD).  A claimants eligibility to receive a homestead property tax reimbursement was based, in part, on whether their income was within the limit used to determine eligibility for PAAD.  This method of calculating income requires a claimant to file a separate application for the homestead property tax reimbursement which reports all source of income, including income they do not report on their New Jersey gross income tax return.  This application process is often cumbersome and confusing for senior freeze applicants. This bill provides that an applicants gross income, as reported pursuant to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, would be used to determine their eligibility for a homestead property tax reimbursement.  Using gross income to determine a claimants eligibility for a homestead property tax reimbursement is intended to make the homestead property tax reimbursement process less stressful because claimants will not have to file a separate application to report their income and the Division of Taxation will be able to determine a claimants eligibility by reviewing their New Jersey gross income tax return. The bill also requires an eligible claimant to file a property tax reimbursement application with their New Jersey gross income tax return.  The bill permits the Director of the Division of Taxation to establish alternate methods of submitting a property tax reimbursement application if an eligible claimant is not required to file a gross income tax return or if an eligible claimant is has filed an extension to file their gross income tax return.  The bill also allows the Director of the Division of Taxation to require the submittal of additional information necessary to determine a claimants eligibility to receive a homestead property tax reimbursement. This bill takes effect immediately but would not be operative until January 1, 2023 in order provide the Division of Taxation time to update its processes for administering the homestead property tax reimbursement program.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.370) 4. This act shall take effect immediately and shall be operative as of January 1, 2023. STATEMENT This bill amends current law to make it easier for eligible claimants to file an application for the homestead property tax reimbursement program.  This program is more commonly known as the senior freeze. In pertinent part, P.L.1997, c.348 limited eligibility for the homestead property tax reimbursement to senior citizens and disabled persons who were eligible for the program of pharmaceutical assistance to the aged and disabled (PAAD).  A claimants eligibility to receive a homestead property tax reimbursement was based, in part, on whether their income was within the limit used to determine eligibility for PAAD.  This method of calculating income requires a claimant to file a separate application for the homestead property tax reimbursement which reports all source of income, including income they do not report on their New Jersey gross income tax return.  This application process is often cumbersome and confusing for senior freeze applicants. This bill provides that an applicants gross income, as reported pursuant to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, would be used to determine their eligibility for a homestead property tax reimbursement.  Using gross income to determine a claimants eligibility for a homestead property tax reimbursement is intended to make the homestead property tax reimbursement process less stressful because claimants will not have to file a separate application to report their income and the Division of Taxation will be able to determine a claimants eligibility by reviewing their New Jersey gross income tax return. The bill also requires an eligible claimant to file a property tax reimbursement application with their New Jersey gross income tax return.  The bill permits the Director of the Division of Taxation to establish alternate methods of submitting a property tax reimbursement application if an eligible claimant is not required to file a gross income tax return or if an eligible claimant is has filed an extension to file their gross income tax return.  The bill also allows the Director of the Division of Taxation to require the submittal of additional information necessary to determine a claimants eligibility to receive a homestead property tax reimbursement. This bill takes effect immediately but would not be operative until January 1, 2023 in order provide the Division of Taxation time to update its processes for administering the homestead property tax reimbursement program.
