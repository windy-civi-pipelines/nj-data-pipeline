It is the sponsors intent that this bill will close current gaps in accountability and increase public transparency concerning the content of PJM meetings, including how meeting participants vote on issues that utilize ratepayer dollars, by requiring electric public utilities to file an annual report on recorded voting to the board.  In so far as electric public utilities are subject to oversight by the board, it is within the boards purview, and in the public interest, to increase public accountability by making such voting records and PJM meeting information a matter of public record.
