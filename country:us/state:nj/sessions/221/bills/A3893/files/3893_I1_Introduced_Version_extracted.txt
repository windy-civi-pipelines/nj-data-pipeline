(2)   The complaint and accompanying documentation shall not be withdrawn absent a showing that the individual is deceased or has capacity.  This showing shall not require medical evidence but may, in the courts discretion, be satisfied by the testimony of the applicant or other witness with knowledge of the alleged incapacitated persons condition and circumstances. (3)   If the individual is a minor under the age of 18 who is anticipated to require a guardian upon attaining the age of 18, the complaint may be filed up to 180 days prior to the date the minor attains the age of 18.  Any judgment designating a guardian pursuant to this paragraph shall take effect no earlier than the date the minor attains the age of 18. (cf: P.L.2005, c.304, s.12) 2.    Section 1 of P.L.1970, c.289 (C.30:4-165.7) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a.  The commissioner or any parent, spouse, relative, or interested party, on behalf of an alleged incapacitated person who is receiving functional or other services and is [over] 18 years of age or over, may file a complaint upon notice to the alleged incapacitated person with the Superior Court in the county furnishing the services or in which [such] the parent, spouse, relative, or interested party resides, for a judgment designating a guardian. b.  If the commissioner or any parent, relative, or interested party on behalf of a minor under the age of 18 who is receiving functional or other services anticipates that the minor may require a guardian upon attaining the age of 18, the commissioner, parent, relative, or interested party may file a complaint with the Superior Court in the county furnishing the services or in which the parent, relative, or interested party resides, for a judgment designating a guardian. The complaint may be filed up to 180 days prior to the date the minor attains the age of 18. Any judgment designating a guardian shall take effect no earlier than the date the minor attains the age of 18. c.  The county of settlement shall be served with a copy of the moving papers, however, the county may waive service of the moving papers if it has no reason to oppose the action.  If the county elects to oppose the action it shall do so within 30 days after being served with a copy of the moving papers. d.  Unless filed by the commissioner, a complaint shall be served by the filing party upon the Division of Developmental Disabilities, to the attention of the Regional Director for the region in which the alleged incapacitated person is receiving functional or other services.  The filing party shall likewise serve upon the Regional Director a copy of the Order Fixing Hearing Date and Appointing Attorney for Alleged Incapacitated Person, as well as a copy of any Judgment of Incapacity and Order Appointing Guardian. (cf: P.L.2015, c.132, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month following enactment. STATEMENT This bill allows a complaint for guardianship of a minor who is anticipated to require a guardian upon attaining the age of 18 to be filed six months before the minor attains the age of 18. The bill also establishes certain standards for filing guardianship complaints in general. Under current law, once a child reaches age 18, a parent or other appropriate person may file a complaint for guardianship. However, if proceedings are delayed and a guardian is not yet appointed, the young person is left without the legal protection of a parent, other appropriate person, or appointed guardian, until such time as the guardian is actually appointed. Allowing guardianship proceedings to be initiated in advance will help avoid potential administrative or procedural delays and ensure a seamless transition as the minor turns age 18.  Under the bill, an order of guardianship entered before a minor is 18 would not take effect until the day the minor turns 18. The bill additionally specifies that a complaint for adjudication of incapacity and appointment of a guardian shall not be withdrawn absent a showing that the alleged incapacitated person is deceased or has capacity.  The showing of capacity does not require medical evidence but may, in the courts discretion, be satisfied by testimony of a witness with knowledge of the alleged incapacitated persons condition and circumstances.
