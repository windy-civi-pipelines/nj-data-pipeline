<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises certain
provisions of the film and digital media content production tax credit program
(program) administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.  Among
other changes, the bill extends the programs availability until July 2049, ten
years longer than it is available under current law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Increased Tax Credit Awards</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill increases the amount
of tax credits that may be awarded to a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey
film-lease production company under the program, from 35 percent to 40 percent
of the taxpayers qualified film production expenses during a tax period, when
the expenses are incurred for services performed and tangible personal property
purchased for use at a sound stage or other location within the State and
within a 30-mile radius of the intersection of Eighth Avenue/Central Park West,
Broadway, and West 59th Street/Central Park South, New York, New York.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Competitive Credit Adjustment</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that if a
neighboring state offers larger tax credit awards for film production purposes
compared to New Jersey, then the tax credit awards issued for certain film
productions are to be increased under the program.  Specifically, if a state
contiguous to this State offers tax credits in an amount equal to or greater
than the amounts allowed under the program, as measured by the percentage of
eligible expenses, then the amount of the tax credits allowed for productions
that occur in one or more counties located, in whole or in part, within a
30-mile radius of the intersection of Eighth Avenue/Central Park West,
Broadway, and West 59th Street/Central Park South, New York, New York would be
increased to no less than 45 percent of the qualified film production expenses
of the taxpayer.  This amount would be five percent more than the tax credits
allowed for a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production
company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Incentive to Relocate Television
Series to New Jersey</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that a New
Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company is eligible
for an additional tax credit in an amount equal to five percent of the
taxpayers qualified film production expenses incurred during a taxable period commencing
on or after July 1, 2025 but before July 1, 2049 for a film that is a
television series that relocated to New Jersey.  The bill defines television
series that relocated to New Jersey to mean a scripted television series of 22
minutes or more in length per episode, with a minimum budget production budget
of $2,500,000 per episode, and for which all prior seasons of the series were
filmed outside New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>New Jersey Film-Lease
Post-Production Company</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines a New Jersey
film-lease post-production company to mean a taxpayer, including any taxpayer
that is a member of combined group or any other entity in which the New Jersey
film-lease post-production company has a material ownership interest and a
material operational role in the production, that otherwise complies with the
eligibility requirements of the program, has made a commitment to lease or
otherwise occupy production space a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, and
satisfies certain criteria set forth in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a New Jersey film-lease
partner facility has not received a temporary or final certificate of
occupancy, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company is required to have
entered into a lease or sublease with the owner or developer of a New Jersey
film-lease partner facility, which lease or sublease is for not less than three
years of occupancy of the New Jersey film-lease partner facility and includes
at least 36,000 square feet of gross rentable space.  For purposes of
satisfying certain provisions in the bill, a New Jersey film-lease
post-production company may include in an application the qualified digital
media content production expenses incurred for postproduction services,
including visual effects services that are performed by any other member of a
New Jersey film-lease production companys combined group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Application and Carry Forward of
Credit</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends current law
to provide an exception to the statutory minimum corporate business tax
liability for the recipient of a film or digital media content production tax
credit.  Under the bill, a credit awarded for application against the corporate
business tax may be claimed as a refundable tax credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a
taxpayers gross income tax liability may not be reduced to an amount less than
zero by the credits awarded under the program.  This bill provides that the tax
liability may be reduced to less than zero, in which case the taxpayer may
elect to receive a refund or carry forward the unused credit for use in a
successive tax period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
provides that a taxpayer, including the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit
transfer certificate, may use the credit in the tax period for which it was
issued, the tax period in which it was issued, or in a successive tax period
after the tax period for which it was issued, without the need to amend the
return for the year for which the credit was issued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Maximum Credit Availability</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, in fiscal
year 2024 and in each fiscal year thereafter until the conclusion of the
program, the cumulative total awards are limited to $150 million for New Jersey
studio partners and $150 million for New Jersey film-lease production
companies.  The authority may, in its discretion, award an additional $400
million to New Jersey studio partners and an additional $250 million to New
Jersey film-lease production companies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends current law
so that, beginning in fiscal year 2026, the maximum cumulative total awards are
increased to $300 million for New Jersey studio partners and $250 million for
New Jersey film-lease production companies.  In addition, the bill decreases
the additional discretionary awards to $250 million for New Jersey studio
partners and $150 million for New Jersey film-lease production companies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Recapture of Tax Credits and
Termination</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
approval of tax credits for New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey
film-lease production companies is subject to award agreements with the
authority detailing obligations of the awardee and outcomes relating to events
of default, including, but not limited to, the recapture of tax credits.  The
bill provides that the recapture of tax credits may only apply to the initial
recipient of the tax credits, not the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit
transfer certificate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law also provides that
if a New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility
developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey
studio partner for the duration of the commitment period, the authority is
required to recapture certain portions of the tax credit.  This bill provides
an exception for any circumstance in which the New Jersey studio partners
failure to occupy the production facility is for any reason outside the control
of the New Jersey studio partner.  Additionally, the bill permits the
authority, rather than requires the authority, to recapture under appropriate
conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that if a
New Jersey film-lease production company fails to occupy the production
facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New
Jersey film lease production company for the duration of the commitment period
or otherwise fails to satisfy the conditions for designation as a New Jersey
film-lease production company, except not including the failure to occupy the
production facility for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey
film-lease production company, the authority may recapture the portion of the tax
credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayers
designation as a New Jersey film-lease production company.  In addition, the
bill requires that all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for
which the authority has not approved final documentation, terminate in this
instance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>New Jersey Film-Lease Production
Company Supplemental Report</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a New
Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work
or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report within two
years after the production concludes.  This bill also permits a New Jersey
film-lease production company to do the same if it satisfies the criteria
required for a New Jersey film-lease production company before a temporary or
final certificate of occupancy is received by the New Jersey film-lease partner
facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Expansion of Tax Credit
Applicability</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, tax credits
awarded under the program may be applied against a taxpayers liability under
the gross income tax or corporation business tax.  In addition, this bill
authorizes the application of these credits against a taxpayers liability for
an insurance premium tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>New Jersey Promotional Credit</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to the amount of
tax credits otherwise allowed under the program, the bill allows an additional
promotional tax credit for certain film productions in an amount equal to two
percent of a taxpayers qualified film production expenses or qualified digital
media content production expenses under certain conditions.  Specifically, a
New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film lease production company may
qualify for this additional credit by submitting, alongside an application to
the authority and the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of
the Treasury (director), a plan outlining specific goals to New Jersey.  Under
the bill, a taxpayer is required to include at least two promotional criteria
in the plan, and the authority and director are required to verify that the
taxpayer has met the goals outlined in its plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, a taxpayer is
required to satisfy at least two of the following promotional criteria to
qualify for the additional promotional credit:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the creation of a video at
least five minutes in length of publicly accessible locations in New Jersey
used for the film, with commentary on how and why each location was chosen,
published on the Internet website promoting the film or in another form and
manner approved by the authority.  To receive credit for this promotional
criterion, a taxpayer is to provide a list of locations in New Jersey used for
the film and relevant footage for use by the authority for promotional
purposes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) the creation of five
public social media posts including commentary on positive experiences at accessible
New Jersey locations or positive experiences filming in the State, using an
official account of the taxpayer or the film, or as otherwise permitted by the
authority.  To receive credit for this promotional criterion, the taxpayer is
to provide the Internet website on which the post is publicly visible for use
by the authority for promotional purposes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) the placement of a New
Jersey promotional logo provided by the authority for a two-second exposure,
not displayed over content or on a shared card, and displayed before the
below-the-line crew crawl;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) a reference to the State
in the film, which is set, at least in part, in New Jersey; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) any alternative criteria
as the authority provides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Credit for Diversity Plan</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a taxpayer
who is eligible for tax credits under the program may receive an additional
credit in an amount equal to two percent of the qualified film production
expenses or four percent of the digital media content production expenses of
the taxpayer during a tax period if: (1) the application is accompanied by a
diversity plan outlining specific goals, which may include advertising and
recruitment actions, for hiring minority persons and women; (2) the director
and the authority have approved the plan as meeting the requirements
established by the director and the authority; and (3) the director and the
authority have verified that the applicant has met or made good faith efforts
in achieving those goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law provides that a
tax credit for four percent of qualified film production expenses may be
available to a taxpayer, rather than two percent, if the diversity plan
includes specific goals that include hiring persons as performers in the film
who are: (1) women or members of a minority group; (2) residents of New Jersey
for at least 12 months preceding the beginning of filming or recording; and (3)
members of a bona fide labor union representing film and television performers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill removes the
additional requirements necessary for a taxpayer to receive a four percent tax
credit, rather than two percent.  Under the bill, a taxpayer may earn a credit
equal to four percent of qualified film production expenses for a diversity
plan meeting the same criteria required for a credit equal to four percent of
digital media content production expenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Modification of Definitions</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the
definition of commitment period for New Jersey studio partners under the
program to be the period beginning with the commencement of the eligibility
period and continuing for a minimum of 10 years following the issuance of a
temporary certificate of occupancy or commencement of a lease term, as
appropriate.  Under current law, the commitment period expires 10 years
following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or commencement
of a lease term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends the
definition of eligibility period, in the case of a taxpayer leasing a
production facility, to mean the period beginning at the commencement of the
lease term for the production facility leased as a condition of designation as
a New Jersey studio partner, and extending thereafter for a term of not less
than 10 years.  Under current law, the term is limited to a maximum of 10
years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill modifies the
definition of qualified film production expenses, as it applies to New Jersey
studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies, to include: the
total script costs of any script written within New Jersey; or the product of
the total script costs and the percentage of the principal photography shoot
days in New Jersey relative to the total principal photography shoot days for the
film.  Under current law, script costs are not included in qualified film
production expenses. </p>
