The bill also repeals the annual sales tax holiday established by P.L.2022, c.21 for retail sale of computers, school computer supplies, school supplies, school instructional materials, and sport or recreational equipment.  Under current law, the sales tax holiday is in effect during the ten-day period up to and including the first Monday in September. This bill implements certain proposals concerning the sales and use tax that were included in the Governors Fiscal Year 2025 budget recommendations.
