(cf: P.L.2018, c.45, s.1) 11.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the tax year next following enactment, except the director may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill would transform the homestead property tax reimbursement program, commonly known as the senior freeze program, from a reimbursement program into a credit program for most eligible homeowners. Currently, eligible seniors and disabled persons may apply for a senior freeze benefit that reimburses them for any property tax increases paid in the prior tax year over and above the amount of property taxes paid in the applicable base year.  This bill would allow most of these eligible homeowners to realize these savings in the form of a credit directly applied to reduce the payable amount for their third and fourth quarter property tax bills for the current tax year. Eligible homeowners who reside in a unit in a cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community, and who do not pay property taxes directly to the municipality, would receive a rebate payment instead of a credit directly applied to the applicable property tax bill.  These rebates would be paid during the current tax year for which the senior freeze benefit is sought so that these homeowners also do not have to wait until the next year to receive their senior freeze benefit.

(cf: P.L.2008, c.119, s.2) 9.    Section 7 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.12) is amended to read as follows: 7.    Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to the contrary, the State Treasurer, the Director of the Division of Taxation, Commissioner of the Department of Banking and Insurance, Commissioner of Education, and the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs may adopt immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law such rules and regulations as that official determines to be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act. Any rules and regulations so filed shall be effective for a period not exceeding 360 days following the effective date of this act and may thereafter be amended, adopted, or readopted by such official in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). a.     The rules and regulations adopted by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs may include, without limitation, provisions to: (1) protect local units against the loss of property tax revenues that may apply to a local unit due to operation of the property tax levy cap attributable to receipt of charitable donations; (2) establish procedures for management of the charitable funds, and the establishment of appropriate timelines to coordinate the various responsibilities of fund administrators and tax collectors established under P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6 et al.); (3) provide guidance to tax collectors as to when a tax bill is deemed assessed for the purposes of subsection c. of section 4 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.9); (4) provide guidance as to how servicing organizations shall implement the election of a local property owner to meet his or her obligation to a local unit and obtain resulting local property tax credits in accordance with P.L.1990, c.69 (C.17:16F-15 et seq.), including, but not limited to, provisions for notice to the servicing organization of credits awarded under P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6 et al.); (5) adjust the percentage of the annual credit-eligible donation cap that may be credited against property tax payments pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.7), if deemed appropriate; (6) establish standards for implementing local property tax credits for qualified charitable contributions toward a school district-established charitable fund where the municipality defers a portion of the school tax levy; and (7) harmonize to the extent necessary the provisions of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6 et al.) with the provisions of the "Local Budget Law," N.J.S.40A:4-1 et seq., and the "Local Fiscal Affairs Law," N.J.S.40A:5-1 et seq. b.    The rules and regulations adopted by the State Treasurer may include, without limitation, guidance as to how qualified donations made pursuant to P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6 et al.) shall impact payments allocated pursuant to the "Homestead Property Tax Credit Act," P.L.1990, c.61 (C.54:4-8.57 et seq.), the "Property Tax Deduction Act," P.L.1996, c.60 (C.54A:3A-15 et seq.), and the homestead property tax [reimbursement] freeze benefit program, P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.67 et al.).

(cf: P.L.2018, c.45, s.1) 11.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the tax year next following enactment, except the director may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill would transform the homestead property tax reimbursement program, commonly known as the senior freeze program, from a reimbursement program into a credit program for most eligible homeowners. Currently, eligible seniors and disabled persons may apply for a senior freeze benefit that reimburses them for any property tax increases paid in the prior tax year over and above the amount of property taxes paid in the applicable base year.  This bill would allow most of these eligible homeowners to realize these savings in the form of a credit directly applied to reduce the payable amount for their third and fourth quarter property tax bills for the current tax year. Eligible homeowners who reside in a unit in a cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community, and who do not pay property taxes directly to the municipality, would receive a rebate payment instead of a credit directly applied to the applicable property tax bill.  These rebates would be paid during the current tax year for which the senior freeze benefit is sought so that these homeowners also do not have to wait until the next year to receive their senior freeze benefit.
