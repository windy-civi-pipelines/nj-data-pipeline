class=HangingAnActChar> </span>providing for joint negotiations by physicians
with carriers, supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, and repealing
P.L.2001, c.371.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of the
State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Active, robust and
fully competitive markets for health care services provide the best opportunity
for the residents of this State to receive high-quality health care services at
an appropriate cost;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A substantial amount of
health care services in this State is purchased for the benefit of patients by
health insurance carriers engaged in the financing of health care services or
is otherwise delivered subject to the terms of agreements between carriers and
physicians;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Carriers are able to
control the flow of patients to physicians through compelling financial
incentives for patients in their health benefits plans to utilize only the
services of physicians with whom the carriers have contracted;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Carriers also control
the health care services rendered to patients through utilization management
and other managed care tools and associated coverage and payment policies;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Carriers are often able
to virtually dictate the terms of the contracts that they offer physicians and
commonly offer these contracts on a take-it-or-leave-it basis;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The power of carriers
to unilaterally impose provider contract terms jeopardizes the ability of
physicians to deliver the superior quality health care services traditionally
available in this State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Physicians do not have
sufficient market power to reject unfair provider contract terms offered by
carriers that impede their ability to deliver medically appropriate care
without undue delay or difficulties;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Inadequate reimbursement
and other unfair payment terms offered by carriers adversely affect the quality
of patient care and access to care by reducing the resources that physicians
can devote to patient care and decreasing the time that physicians are able to
spend with their patients;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Inequitable
reimbursement and other unfair payment terms also endanger the health care
infrastructure and medical progress by diverting capital needed for
reinvestment in the health care delivery system, curtailing the purchase of
state-of-the-art technology, the pursuit of medical research, and expansion of
medical services, all to the detriment of the residents of this State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     The inevitable
collateral reduction and migration of the health care work force will also have
negative consequences for the economy of this State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    Empowering independent
physicians to jointly negotiate with carriers as provided in this act will help
restore the competitive balance and improve competition in the markets for health
care services in this State, thereby providing benefits for consumers,
physicians and less dominant carriers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     This act is necessary
and proper, and constitutes an appropriate exercise of the authority of this
State to regulate the business of insurance and the delivery of health care
services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.   The pro-competitive and
other benefits of the joint negotiations and related joint activity authorized
by this act, including, but not limited to, restoring the competitive balance
in the market for health care services, protecting access to quality patient
care, promoting the health care infrastructure and medical progress, and
improving communications, outweigh any potential anti-competitive effects of
this act; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.    It is the intention of
the Legislature to authorize independent physicians to jointly negotiate with
carriers and to qualify such joint negotiations and related joint activities
for the State-action exemption to the federal antitrust laws through the
articulated State policy and active supervision provided under this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Carrier&quot; means an
insurance company, health service corporation, hospital service corporation,
medical service corporation or health maintenance organization which is
authorized to issue health benefits plans in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Covered person&quot;
means a person on whose behalf a carrier which offers a health benefits plan is
obligated to pay benefits or provide services pursuant to the plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Covered service&quot;
means a health care service provided to a covered person under a health
benefits plan for which the carrier is obligated to pay benefits or provide
services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Health benefits
plan&quot; means a plan which pays or provides hospital and medical expense
benefits for covered services, and is delivered or issued for delivery in this
State by or through a carrier.  For the purposes of this act, health benefits
plan shall not include the following plans, policies or contracts:  Medicare
supplement coverage and risk contracts, accident only, specified disease or
other limited benefit, credit, disability, long term care, TRICARE supplement
coverage, coverage arising out of a workers' compensation or similar law,
automobile medical payment insurance, personal injury protection insurance
issued pursuant to P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-1 et seq.), dental or vision care
coverage only, or hospital expense or confinement indemnity coverage only.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Joint negotiation
representative&quot; means a representative selected by two or more independent
physicians to engage in joint negotiations with a carrier on their behalf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Physician&quot; means a
person who is licensed to practice medicine and surgery by the State Board of
Medical Examiners in accordance with the provisions of Title 45 of the Revised
Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Utilization management&quot;
means a system for reviewing the appropriate and efficient allocation of health
care services under a health benefits plan in accordance with specific
guidelines, for the purpose of determining whether, or to what extent, a health

the proposed joint negotiations.  In making his determination, the Attorney
General shall consider physician distribution by specialty and its effect on
competition in the geographic service area of the carrier.</p>
