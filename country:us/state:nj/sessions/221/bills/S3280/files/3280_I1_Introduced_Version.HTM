Under the bill, if a student requests a transcript for purposes of transfer to another institution, application for enrollment in a graduate degree program, or for employment including internships, fellowships, certifications, licensures, and special programs, an institution cannot, due to an outstanding balance on a students account of $2,000 or less of non-mandatory charges: (1) refuse to provide a transcript for a student on the grounds that the student owes a debt; (2) condition the provision of a transcript on the payment of a debt, other than a fee charged to provide the transcript; (3) charge a higher fee for obtaining a transcript, or provide less favorable treatment of a transcript request because a student owes a debt; or (4) use transcript issuance as a tool for debt collection. The bill further provides that an institution may condition the provision of a transcript to a student on the students agreement to enter into a good faith repayment plan and submission of the first payment on that plan if the student owes the institution: (1) any amount for unpaid tuition, room and board, or other mandatory student fees or charges; or (2) an amount exceeding $2,000 for non-mandatory charges. Under the bill, an institution cannot restrict or condition the provision of a transcript to a student who attests that the transcript is needed to apply for new student loans or to refinance existing student loans.
