This fraction] shall be multiplied by [the total amount of the money available in the "Municipal Court Administration Reimbursement Fund" in the preceding calendar year] 50 percentage, and the resulting figure shall then be divided by the total number of drunk driving arrests in the municipality for the same calendar year to determine the unit dollar value for each arrest. (b)   The total amount of funding received by the municipality from the Alcohol Education, Rehabilitation and Enforcement Fund in the preceding year shall be multiplied by 50 percentage, and the resulting figure shall then be divided by the average number of yearly drunk driving arrests in the municipality for the preceding five calendar years to determine a five-year unit dollar value for each arrest. (c)   The figure calculated pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall be added to the figure calculated pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, and the resulting figure shall determine the total unit dollar value for each arrest. (d)   The amount to be allocated to each reporting municipality shall be the proportion of its total unit dollar value to the total amount of funds available for allocation from the Municipal Court Administration Reimbursement Fund. (4)   This amount shall be allocated to the municipality for the purpose of maintaining its municipal court, which may include payments to municipal court judges, municipal prosecutors and other municipal court personnel for work performed in addition to regular employment hours.
