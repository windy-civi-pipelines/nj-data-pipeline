<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would make various
changes to the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410
(C.52:14B-1 et seq.), which establishes the procedures by which State agencies
adopt rules and regulations.  The bill would also establish a &quot;Commission
on Efficiency and Regulatory Review&quot; to review rules and regulations and Executive
Orders issued, respectively, by a State agency or by the Governor.  In
addition, the bill would require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
to convey certain information regarding permit issuances to the Legislature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would establish the Commission
on Efficiency and Regulatory Review in the Office of Administrative Law in the
Department of the Treasury.  The commission would be chaired by a member of the
public appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate, and
would be composed of various members of the Executive Branch and the
Legislature, or their designees.  Section 2 of the bill would establish the
duties of the commission, including to review all proposed and adopted rules
and regulations and operative Executive Orders issued by the Governor to:
assess their potential or actual effects on the State's economy; determine
whether their costs and other burdens on businesses, workers, and local
governments outweigh their intended benefits; and establish a basis for
providing recommendations to the Governor for the amendment, rescission, or
repeal of any rules, regulations, or Executive Orders that unduly burden the
State's businesses, workers, and local governments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also amend
P.L.1991, c.423 (C.13:1D-105), which established a three-year requirement for
the DEP to provide an annual report to the Legislature on DEP permit
applications and issuances, in order to make this requirement permanent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would amend
the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act&quot; to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  require the
socio-economic impact statement that accompanies proposed rules to include an
assessment of the proposed rule's effects on the State's economy;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  require proposed rules to
be accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  require State agencies to
use the best available science, data, and studies when formulating the various rulemaking
impact statements that are required under law;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  require the Office of
Administrative Law to review and certify the adequacy of rulemaking impact
statements;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  require State agencies to
file a statement of intent for each rule proposal at least 90 days prior to the
formal notice of action for the rule proposal, and to accept public comment on
the rule proposal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  require that, in order to
make substantive changes to a rule proposal upon adoption, the potential
changes are a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule; otherwise a new rule must
be adopted;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)  allow State agencies to
extend existing rules with no changes or technical changes using an expedited
process only if the rule extension proposal receives no adverse comments from
the public.  If the proposal receives adverse public comment, the agency would
be required to readopt the rules using the ordinary process under the &quot;Administrative
Procedure Act&quot;; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)  clarify that rule extensions
with substantive changes are required to be effectuated using the ordinary
process under the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; not an expedited
process.</p>
