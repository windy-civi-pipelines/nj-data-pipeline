This bill requires the inspection of one and two family housing units for the presence of an explosive gas sensor device prior to initial occupancy, or a change of occupancy.  The bill also requires the placement of explosive gas sensor devices in hotel and multiple dwelling units, and in rooming and boarding house units.  These requirements would not apply if it is determined, in accordance with rules promulgated by the Commissioner of Community Affairs, that there is no potential explosive gas hazard in the dwelling unit.  Similar requirements for one and two family housing, hotel and multiple dwellings, and rooming and boarding houses already exist with regard to carbon monoxide sensor devices. The sensor devices required under this bill shall comply with the applicable standards of the American National Standards Institute for residential devices for the detection of explosive quantities of methane and propane gases, unless superseded by rules adopted by the Commissioner of Community Affairs.
