The bill requires that any critical health care resource allocation policy developed by the DOH require general acute care hospitals to make reasonable modifications to Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score to ensure individuals with an underlying health condition do not receive a lower score when the underlying health condition is unrelated to hospital survival or unrelated to the efficacy of the health care resource under consideration. The bill requires any critical health care resource allocation policy developed by the DOH to prohibit hospitals and nursing homes from issuing do not resuscitate orders that apply to all patients or residents of the facility.  Any do not resuscitate policy developed by a hospital or nursing home will be required to account for the treatment preferences of the patient or resident, to the extent they may be determined through an advance directive, a practitioner orders for life-sustaining treatment (POLST) form, or other appropriate means.
