<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      1.   Section 3 of P.L.1973,
c.83 (C.19:44A-3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in this act,

P.L.1993, c.65.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The term
&quot;candidate&quot; means: (1) an individual seeking election to a public
office of the State or of a county, municipality or school district at an
election; except that the term shall not include an individual seeking party
office; (2) an individual who shall have been elected or failed of election to
an office, other than a party office, for which he sought election and who
receives contributions and makes expenditures for any of the purposes
authorized by section 17 of P.L.1993, c.65 (C.19:44A-11.2) during the period of
his service in that office; and (3) an individual who has received funds or
other benefits or has made payments solely for the purpose of determining
whether the individual should become a candidate as defined in paragraphs (1)
and (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The terms &quot;contributions&quot;
and &quot;expenditures&quot; include all loans and transfers of money or other
thing of value to or by any candidate, candidate committee, joint candidates
committee, political committee, continuing political committee, independent
expenditure committee, political party committee or legislative leadership
committee, and all pledges or other commitments or assumptions of liability to
make any such transfer; and for purposes of reports required under the

such commitment is made or liability assumed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The term
&quot;election&quot; means any election described in section 4 of this act.</p>

than the committee, candidate or organization for whom such services are
rendered.  In determining the value, for the purpose of reports required under
this act, of contributions made in the form of paid personal services, the person
contributing such services shall furnish to the treasurer through whom such
contribution is made a statement setting forth the actual amount of
compensation paid by said contributor to the individuals actually performing
said services for the performance thereof.  But if any individual or
individuals actually performing such services also performed for the
contributor other services during the same period, and the manner of payment
was such that payment for the services contributed cannot readily be segregated
from contemporary payment for the other services, the contributor shall in his
statement to the treasurer so state and shall either (1) set forth his best
estimate of the dollar amount of payment to each such individual which is
attributable to the contribution of his paid personal services, and shall
certify the substantial accuracy of the same, or (2) if unable to determine
such amount with sufficient accuracy, set forth the total compensation paid by
him to each such individual for the period of time during which the services
contributed by him were performed.  If any candidate is a holder of public
office to whom there is attached or assigned, by virtue of said office, any
aide or aides whose services are of a personal or confidential nature in assisting
him to carry out the duties of said office, and whose salary or other
compensation is paid in whole or part out of public funds, the services of such
aide or aides which are paid for out of public funds shall be for public
purposes only; but they may contribute their personal services, on a voluntary
basis, to such candidate for election campaign purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes various
changes to reporting requirements for independent expenditure committees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill clarifies that
independent expenditure committees will report on the same schedule as
continuing political committees.  The bill also modifies how expenditures will
be reported.  Independent expenditures, which are made to expressly advocate
for or against a candidate or a public question, over $3,000 will be reported
in each quarterly report.  If the committee makes any electioneering
communicationwhich the bill defines as a communication valued at over $3,000 in
the aggregate during any calendar year that refers to a candidate or a public
question and is made within the 60 days before an election, and can be received
by at least 10 percent of the electoratethen all expenditures over $3,000 made
for the purpose of influencing or providing political information on the
outcome of any election or public question will be reported. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, an
independent expenditure means an expenditure expressly advocating the election
or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or a public question, legislation,
or regulation.  The bill removes attempting to influence legislation and
regulations as activity for which contributions and expenditures would have to
be reported.  The bill also modifies the definition of independent expenditure
committee to reflect committees that are restricted by law or regulation with
regard to the coordination of its activities with any candidate or political
party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also modifies the
definition of electioneering communication.  Currently, an electioneering
communication is a communication made within the period beginning on January 1
of an election year and the date of the election and refers to a candidate or a
public question, regardless of whether it expressly advocates for or against a
candidate or public question.  The bill revises that definition to mean a
communication for which the direct costs of producing and disseminating exceed
$3,000 in the aggregate during any calendar year, that refers to a clearly
identified candidate or a public question and is made within 60 days before the
primary, general, municipal, school, or special election, and that can be
received by at least 10 percent of the electorate the candidate seeks to
represent or the electorate responsible for deciding the public question,
regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates for or against the
candidate or public question.  The bill excludes certain communications in news
stories or editorials, communications in a candidate debate, and communications
by an organization exclusively to its members, stockholders, or executive or
administrative personnel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill raises the threshold
for reporting certain contributions to the Election Law Enforcement Commission
(ELEC) within 48 hours of receipt when those contributions are received on or
before a primary, general, municipal, school, or special election that occurs
between the last day of a quarterly reporting period and the last day of the
next reporting period.  Currently, while contributions to independent
expenditure committees are reportable when they exceed $10,000, contributions
during this time period are reportable when they exceed $500.  The bill would
change this amount to match the current contribution threshold of over $10,000,
requiring that such contributions be reported to ELEC within 48 hours when
received during that time.  The bill makes the same change with respect to
expenditures, changing the $800 threshold to the $3,000 threshold to which
independent expenditure committees are otherwise subject for purposes of
reporting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill broadens the activity
for which a foreign national, government, or agent is prohibited from
registering as an independent expenditure committee to include making any
expenditure in any State or local election, rather than only an independent
expenditure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill lowers, from $5,500
to $2,500, the contributions threshold for a group to qualify as a continuing
political committee to match the threshold for requiring that group to certify
to ELEC that the committee expects to contribute that amount concerning
election related activity.  The bill also revises, in subsections f. and g. in
section 2 of the bill, a provision of law that permits the exclusion of
contributions below a reportable amount to match the threshold currently
applicable to independent expenditure committees for those groups.</p>
