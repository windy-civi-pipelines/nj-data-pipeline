If such a person attains the age of 70 years while serving as [a county prosecutor or as] the Administrative Director of the Courts and has an approved application for the member's retirement the effective date of which has been deferred, this section shall specifically override the JRS mandatory retirement age of 70 enacted in section 7 of P.L.1973, c.140 (C.43:6A-7) and in the administrative code, and shall allow for the deferment of the mandatory retirement for JRS to the first day of the month following the termination of the member's service in the position of [county prosecutor or of] Administrative Director of the Courts. If such a person dies while in service as [a county prosecutor or as] the Administrative Director of the Courts, the death shall not be considered a death in active service.  The beneficiary shall be eligible for a pension or survivor's benefit, and for any death benefits, based on the approved retirement application and the retirement shall be effective as of the date of death.  The election by the member of an option in accordance with section 1 of P.L.2002, c.54 (C.43:6A-16.1) shall become effective and payable.

This section shall be effective if the qualified status of the retirement system under federal law can be maintained upon its application, and such modifications to the system as may be available shall be made to allow for its application.1 (cf: P.L.2022, c.94, s,1) 16.  Section 2 of P.L.2019, c.287 (C.52:14-17.32o) is amended to read as follows: 2.   Notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.26 et seq.) to the contrary, from funds appropriated therefor, the State shall pay the premium or periodic charges for the benefits provided to a retired State employee and any dependents under the program, but not including survivors, if the employee: (a) submitted an application for retirement with the Judicial Retirement System pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2019, c.287 (C.43:6A-11.1); (b) subsequently served in the position of [county prosecutor or of] Administrative Director of the Courts; (c) was covered by the program at the time of terminating full-time employment as a judge with the State, and (d) was eligible for health care benefits coverage in retirement under the program paid in full or in part by the State at the time of terminating full-time employment as a judge with the State. The health care benefits coverage in retirement under the program to which the former State employee is entitled shall be deferred.  The former State employee shall notify the program of the date on which employment as [a county prosecutor or as] the Administrative Director of the Courts is terminated and the deferred retirement is to commence pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2019, c.287 (C.43:6A-11.1).  The former State employee and the employee's dependents shall be enrolled in the program as soon as feasible after that termination date and shall be entitled to such health care benefits coverage and payments for such coverage as the former State employee was eligible on the date terminating full-time employment as a judge with the State.1 (cf: P.L.2021, c.329, s.2) 1[2.]  7.1  This act shall take effect immediately.
