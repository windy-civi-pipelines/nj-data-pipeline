(cf: P.L.2005, c.208, s.2) 3.    Section 1 of P.L.1997, c.411 (C.39:4-10.5) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  As used in this act: Director means the Director of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Roller skates means a pair of devices worn on the feet with a set of wheels attached, regardless of the number or placement of those wheels, and used to glide or propel the user over the ground. Scooter means a device with a set of wheels attached, regardless of the number or placement of those wheels, designed to be operated from a standing position and controlled by use of a handle bar and used to glide and propel the user over the ground. Motorized scooter shall have the same meaning as provided in R.S.39:1-1. b.    A person [under 17 years of age] shall not operate any roller skates, scooter, motorized scooter, or skateboard unless that person is wearing a properly fitted and fastened helmet which meets the standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI Z90.4 bicycle helmet standard), the Snell Memorial Foundations 1990 Standard for Protective Headgear for Use in Bicycling, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard or other such standard, as appropriate. c.     The requirement in subsection b. of this section shall apply at all times while a person subject to the provisions of this act is operating roller skates, or a scooter, or a motorized scooter, or skateboarding on any property open to the public or used by the public for roller skating or skateboarding, or scootering.

(cf: P.L.2005, c.208, s.4) 6.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires all persons to wear a helmet when bicycling, roller skating, or skateboarding.  Current law requires persons 17 years of age and younger to wear a helmet when bicycling, roller skating, or skateboarding.  This bill also extends the helmet requirement to operators of non-motorized and motorized scooters. Under current law, it is unlawful to manufacture, assemble, sell, offer to sell, or distribute bicycles, roller skates, or skateboards without a warning notice advising customers of the legal provisions concerning the wearing of approved helmets and appropriate personal protection equipment, and persons selling or renting bicycles, roller skates, or skateboards are required to advise their customers of these legal provisions and make helmets available to persons subject to the helmet requirement.  Businesses complying with these requirements would not be liable in a civil action for damages for any physical injury sustained by a bicyclist, roller skater, or skateboarder who fails to wear a helmet.  The bill expands these requirements and civil immunity provisions to non-motorized and motorized scooters. The bill does not amend section 8 of P.L.1997, c.411 (C.39:4-10.12), and therefore, it is the sponsors understanding that the bills provisions do not apply to operators and patrons of roller skating rinks subject to the New Jersey Roller Skating Rink Safety and Fair Liability Act, P.L.1991, c.28 (C.5:14-1 et seq.).
