<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 5 of P.L.1991,
c.261 (C.2C:25-21) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    a.  When a person claims
to be a victim of domestic violence, and where a law enforcement officer
responding to the incident finds probable cause to believe that domestic
violence has occurred, the law enforcement officer shall arrest the person who
is alleged to be the person who subjected the victim to domestic violence and
shall sign a criminal complaint if:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  The victim exhibits signs
of injury caused by an act of domestic violence; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  A warrant is in effect; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  There is probable cause
to believe that the person has violated N.J.S.2C:29-9, and there is probable
cause to believe that the person has been served with the order alleged to have
been violated.  If the victim does not have a copy of a purported order, the
officer may verify the existence of an order with the appropriate law
enforcement agency; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  There is probable cause
to believe that a weapon as defined in N.J.S.2C:39-1 has been involved in the
commission of an act of domestic violence.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A law enforcement
officer may arrest a person; or may sign a criminal complaint against that
person, or may do both, where there is probable cause to believe that an act of
domestic violence has been committed, but where none of the conditions in
subsection a. of this section applies.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    (1)  As used in this
section, the word &quot;exhibits&quot; is to be liberally construed to mean any
indication that a victim has suffered bodily injury, which shall include
physical pain or any impairment of physical condition. Where the victim
exhibits no visible sign of injury, but states that an injury has occurred, the
officer should consider other relevant factors in determining whether there is
probable cause to make an arrest.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  In determining which
party in a domestic violence incident is the victim where both parties exhibit
signs of injury, the officer should consider the comparative extent of the
injuries, the history of domestic violence between the parties, if any, and any
other relevant factors.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  No victim shall be denied
relief or arrested or charged under this act with an offense because the victim
used reasonable force in self defense against domestic violence by an
attacker.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1)  In addition to a
law enforcement officer's authority to seize any weapon that is contraband,
evidence or an instrumentality of crime, a law enforcement officer who has
probable cause to believe that an act of domestic violence has been committed
shall:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   question persons present
to determine whether there are weapons on the premises; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  upon observing or
learning that a weapon is present on the premises, seize any weapon that the
officer reasonably believes would expose the victim to a risk of serious bodily
injury.  If a law enforcement officer seizes any firearm pursuant to this
paragraph, the officer shall also seize any <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>firearm<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>firearms</u>
purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun issued to the
person accused of the act of domestic violence.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  A law enforcement officer
shall deliver all weapons, firearms purchaser identification cards and permits
to purchase a handgun seized pursuant to this section to the county prosecutor
and shall append an inventory of all seized items to the domestic violence
report.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Weapons seized in
accordance with the &quot;Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991&quot;,
P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.) shall be returned to the owner except upon
order of the Superior Court.  The prosecutor who has possession of the seized
weapons may, upon notice to the owner, petition a judge of the Family Part of
the Superior Court, Chancery Division, within 45 days of seizure, to obtain
title to the seized weapons, or to revoke any and all permits, licenses and
other authorizations for the use, possession, or ownership of such weapons
pursuant to the law governing such use, possession, or ownership, or may object
to the return of the weapons on such grounds as are provided for the initial
rejection or later revocation of the authorizations, or on the grounds that the
owner is unfit or that the owner poses a threat to the public in general or a
person or persons in particular.</p>
