The developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that all documents submitted, and factual assertions made, to the authority to demonstrate that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State in accordance with this [subsection] paragraph are true and accurate at the time of submission. A redevelopment project located in a government-restricted municipality shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (2)   For a redevelopment project subject to the requirement of paragraph (2) of subsection c. of this section to be eligible for any tax credits under the program, a developer shall demonstrate to the authority that the award of tax credits will yield a net neutral benefit to the State equaling an amount not less than the requested tax credit amount.  The developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that all documents submitted, and factual assertions made, to the authority to demonstrate that the award of tax credits will yield a net neutral benefit to the State in accordance with this paragraph are true and accurate at the time of submission. e.     If at any time during the eligibility period the authority determines that the developer made a material misrepresentation on the developer's application, the developer shall forfeit the incentive award. f.     If circumstances require a developer to amend its application to the authority, then the developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify to the authority that the information provided in its amended application is true under the penalty of perjury. (cf: P.L.2021, c.160, s.24) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to applications submitted on and after the effective date of this act. STATEMENT This bill revises certain eligibility requirements under the New Jersey Aspire Program, which was established by the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, P.L.2020, c.156. The program provides tax credits to encourage redevelopment programs by covering certain project financing gap costs. Under current law, for applications submitted under the program, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority is required to review the project cost of the redevelopment project, evaluate and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided to the project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, provided that the net benefit analysis does not apply to certain projects.  The bill revises these criteria to require the authority to apply a net neutral benefit analysis for projects that have a total project cost of at least $17 million, including at least $3.4 million in total sustainability and resiliency costs and not less than $1,000 for each of the sustainability and resiliency costs, as applicable, enumerated in the definition for sustainability and resiliency costs under the bill.

The developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that all documents submitted, and factual assertions made, to the authority to demonstrate that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State in accordance with this [subsection] paragraph are true and accurate at the time of submission.

(2)   For a redevelopment project subject to the requirement of paragraph (2) of subsection c. of this section to be eligible for any tax credits under the program, a developer shall demonstrate to the authority that the award of tax credits will yield a net neutral benefit to the State equaling an amount not less than the requested tax credit amount.  The developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that all documents submitted, and factual assertions made, to the authority to demonstrate that the award of tax credits will yield a net neutral benefit to the State in accordance with this paragraph are true and accurate at the time of submission. e.     If at any time during the eligibility period the authority determines that the developer made a material misrepresentation on the developer's application, the developer shall forfeit the incentive award. f.     If circumstances require a developer to amend its application to the authority, then the developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify to the authority that the information provided in its amended application is true under the penalty of perjury. (cf: P.L.2021, c.160, s.24) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to applications submitted on and after the effective date of this act. STATEMENT This bill revises certain eligibility requirements under the New Jersey Aspire Program, which was established by the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, P.L.2020, c.156. The program provides tax credits to encourage redevelopment programs by covering certain project financing gap costs. Under current law, for applications submitted under the program, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority is required to review the project cost of the redevelopment project, evaluate and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided to the project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, provided that the net benefit analysis does not apply to certain projects.  The bill revises these criteria to require the authority to apply a net neutral benefit analysis for projects that have a total project cost of at least $17 million, including at least $3.4 million in total sustainability and resiliency costs and not less than $1,000 for each of the sustainability and resiliency costs, as applicable, enumerated in the definition for sustainability and resiliency costs under the bill.
