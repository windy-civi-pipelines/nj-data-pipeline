<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises certain
eligibility requirements under the New Jersey Aspire Program, which was
established by the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, P.L.2020, c.156. 
The program provides tax credits to encourage redevelopment programs by
covering certain project financing gap costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, for
applications submitted under the program, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority
is required to review the project cost of the redevelopment project, evaluate
and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct
a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided
to the project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, provided
that the net benefit analysis does not apply to certain projects.  The bill
revises these criteria to require the authority to apply a net neutral benefit
analysis for projects that have a total project cost of at least $17 million,
including at least $3.4 million in total sustainability and resiliency costs
and not less than $1,000 for each of the sustainability and resiliency costs,
as applicable, enumerated in the definition for sustainability and resiliency
costs under the bill.</p>
