offering the animal for adoption or sale, as applicable, by obtaining and
retaining records of:</p>

examination by a State licensed veterinarian performed on the animal when the
animal is received by the animal rescue organization facility, shelter, or
pound and a subsequent medical examination no more than 14 days before the
animal is adopted;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  a complete behavioral and
psychological assessment by a certified animal behaviorist, psychologist, or
trainer, including a safety and temperament certification verifying that the
animal does not appear to exhibit behavior or tendencies that would make the
animal dangerous or unsuitable for adoption; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  to the extent possible,
any information concerning the animals history, including any dangerous
behavior, illnesses, injuries, physical or behavioral abnormalities, history of
dangerous behavior, vaccinations received, number, type, and location of homes
the animal has had, the reasons the animal left its previous homes, any history
of biting, scratching, or attacking people or animals, or any other known
health, behavioral, or medical information that may cause concern for a person
adopting the animal.</p>

rescue organization facility, shelter, pound, and pet shop in the State to
disclose in writing any and all information obtained concerning the animals

with an advisory notice that the records may be incomplete.  The bill also
requires the person adopting or purchasing the animal to sign a form verifying
that the written disclosure was provided.</p>

the bill, or to post or describe behavioral information about an animal on the
Internet without evidence of that behavioral information.  In addition to the
penalties imposed for violating consumer fraud law, if the animal causes bodily
harm to, or death of, another animal or any person following the adoption or
sale of the animal, and the animal rescue organization, shelter, pound, or pet
shop, as applicable, failed to provide the safety and temperament certification
required under the bill or knowingly withheld any behavioral information
required to be disclosed under the bill, the animal rescue organization,
shelter, or pound would be liable for a penalty of five times the adoption fee
charged for the animal or a pet shop would be liable for a penalty of five
times the purchase price of the animal.</p>
