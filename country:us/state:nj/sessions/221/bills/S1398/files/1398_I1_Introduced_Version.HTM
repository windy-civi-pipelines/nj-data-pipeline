or municipality.  Instead, a business entity seeking to enter into or holding a

committee, or continuing political committee, in addition to candidate

Branch, State authorities, the Legislative Branch, counties, and municipalities,

existing law that exclude contracts awarded pursuant to a fair and open

contracts that are valued at $17,500 or less will be excluded;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>    3) increase the amount that may
be contributed by business entities from the current $300 to $1,000; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>    4)  modify the definition in
the law of the term business entity to match the definition set forth in
Governor Corzines Executive Order No.117 of 2008;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>    5) modify the disclosure
requirement for business entity that contracts with a single State agency, or a
county, municipality, independent authority, board of education, or fire
district for $17,500 or more and makes a contribution of money or other thing
of value to an independent expenditure committee to disclose all such
contributions; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>    6)  add a definition of
independent expenditure committee for the purpose of the reports required to
be made by business entities of their contributions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>    As part of these changes to
create a uniform pay to play law, the bill repeals sections of law that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>    1) prohibit a government
aggregator that is a county or municipality from awarding a contract to a
licensed power supplier if that supplier has made a contribution to the
committee of any candidate for public office; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>    2)  apply pay to play in the
context of State Executive Branch contracting; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>    3)  allow local governments to
adopt their own pay to play ordinances and policies.</p>
