MCKNIGHT District 31 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS Prohibits photo identification requirement for residential rental application. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning protections for applicants or prospective tenants of residential rental units and supplementing chapter 42 of Title 2A of the New Jersey Statutes.

"Third-party screening vendor" means a company or vendor that engages in the business of collecting, assembly, and evaluating residential tenant applications for the purpose of facilitating a landlords approval or rejection of a prospective tenants application. 3.  a.  A landlord or third-party screening vendor shall not require or request that an applicant or prospective tenant submit or show photo identification as part of their application for the rental unit, or condition approval of an application for a rental unit on the submission or provision of photo identification. b.  A violation of subsection a. of this section shall constitute an unlawful practice pursuant to P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), and a landlord or third-party screening vendor who violates P.L.    , c.    (C.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be subject to all remedies and penalties available pursuant to P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.). c.  A landlord or third-party screening vendor who violates subsection a. of this section shall also, at the discretion of the applicant or prospective tenant, be subject to a separate cause of action by the applicant or prospective tenant in the Superior Court, Law Division, Special Civil Part in the county in which the rental premises are located.  The applicant or prospective tenant may recover $1,000 for each offense by the landlord or third-party screening vendor, in addition to reasonable attorneys fees or expenses. 4.
