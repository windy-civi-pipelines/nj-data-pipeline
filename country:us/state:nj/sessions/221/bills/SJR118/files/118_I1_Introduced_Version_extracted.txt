New Jersey is committed to raising awareness, providing education and training, and reducing stigma related to suicide.  By ensuring that those in need have access to services and educating families to help reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues and suicide, New Jersey can help individuals struggling with thoughts of suicide and promote an environment of inclusivity and support throughout the State.
