<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill removes
investigation and security services from the imposition of the sales and use
tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law,
investigation and security services are subject to the sales and use tax and
are broadly defined as:  (1) investigation and detective services, including
detective agencies and private investigators, and fingerprint, polygraph
missing person tracing and skip tracing services; (2) security guard and patrol
services, including bodyguard and personal protection, guard dog, guard,
patrol, and security services; (3) armored car services; and (4) security
systems services, including security, burglar, and fire alarm installation,
repair or monitoring services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The tax imposed on these
services has increased the overall cost paid by consumers and served as a
disincentive for the States investigation and security services providers. The
additional expense associated with the tax has forced certain recipients to
reduce the overall level of investigation and security services they receive,
and has led certain others to avoid sales tax liabilities through the
development of proprietary, in-house investigation and security personnel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The elimination of the sales
and use tax imposed on investigation and security services will alleviate the
overall tax paid by consumers and reduce the burden imposed on investigation
and security service providers in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill takes effect
immediately upon enactment.  </p>
