Under the bill, a dog brought to a State veterans residential facility by a family member of a resident must have a harness, leash, or other tether.  If the handler is unable because of a disability to use a harness, leash, or other tether, the dog must be under the handler's control by voice command, signals, or other effective means. The bill also provides that a dog brought by an animal shelter, nonprofit organization, or charity group may go without a harness, leash, or other tether in an outdoor setting at the discretion of the dogs handler and the management at the facility.  However, if in an indoor setting, a dog brought by an animal shelter, nonprofit organization, or charity group must have a harness, leash, or other tether, except that if the handler with the animal shelter, nonprofit organization, or charity group is unable because of a disability to use a harness, leash, or other tether, the dog must be under the handler's control by voice command, signals, or other effective means.
