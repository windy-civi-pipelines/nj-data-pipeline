SJR26 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION No. 26 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  ROBERT W. SINGER District 30 (Monmouth and Ocean) SYNOPSIS Designates July 9 of each year as Creatine Day in New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Joint Resolution designating July 9 of each year as Creatine Day in New Jersey. Whereas, Creatine is one of the most popular and fastest-growing sports nutrition supplements; and Whereas, Creatine is a combination of three amino acids: glycine, arginine, and methionine; and Whereas, A naturally occurring compound, creatine is produced by the body and is also found in high-protein foods such as beef and fish; and Whereas, A broad body of clinical research has shown that creatine can enhance muscle growth, sports performance, strength, training, post-exercise recovery, and injury prevention and rehabilitation; and Whereas, A typical healthy diet consists of roughly one to two grams of naturally occurring creatine per day.  This amount of creatine would saturate between 60 percent to 80 percent of the bodys muscles; and Whereas, The use of a creatine supplement can help the body achieve an additional 20 percent to 40 percent of muscle saturation to allow for optimal athletic performance; and Whereas, While creatine is primarily known to benefit strength and muscle health, additional research has shown that creatine may have benefits beyond the gym, such as healthy aging, combatting muscle loss in older individuals, supporting brain function and memory, aiding glucose metabolism, and providing for a healthy blood sugar balance; and Whereas, In recognition of the many proven benefits of creatine with regard to aging, health, strength, and athletic performance, it is altogether fitting and proper to designate July 9 of each year as Creatine Day in this State; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  July 9 of each year is designated as Creatine Day in New Jersey to draw attention to the many proven benefits of creatine with regard to aging, health, strength, and athletic performance. 2.  The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation recognizing July 9 of each year as Creatine Day in New Jersey. 3.  This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates July 9 of each year as Creatine Day in New Jersey. Creatine is one of the most popular and fastest-growing sports nutrition supplements.  Creatine is a combination of three amino acids: glycine, arginine, and methionine.  A naturally occurring compound, creatine is produced by the body and is also found in high-protein foods such as beef and fish.  A broad body of clinical research has shown that creatine can enhance muscle growth, sports performance, strength, training, post-exercise recovery, and injury prevention and rehabilitation.
