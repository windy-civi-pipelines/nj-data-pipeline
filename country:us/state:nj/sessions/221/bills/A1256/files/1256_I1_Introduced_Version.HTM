<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.43:21-6 is amended
to read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43:21-6.  (a) Filing. (1) 
Claims for benefits shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the
Director of the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of
the Department of Labor and Workforce Development of the State of New Jersey
may approve.  Each employer shall post and maintain on his premises printed
notices of his subject status, of such design, in such numbers and at such
places as the director of the division may determine to be necessary to give
notice thereof to persons in the employer's service.  Each employer shall give
to each individual at the time he becomes unemployed, for any reason, whether
the unemployment is permanent or temporary, a printed copy of benefit
instructions.  The benefit instructions given to the individual shall include,
but not be limited to, the following information: (A) the date upon which the
individual becomes unemployed, and, in the case that the unemployment is
temporary, to the extent possible, the date upon which the individual is
expected to be recalled to work; and (B) that the individual may lose some or
all of the benefits to which he is entitled if he fails to file a claim in a
timely manner.  Both the aforesaid notices and instructions, including
information detailing the time sensitivity of filing a claim, and directions
provided in advance to all employers regarding what information the division
requires employers to provide to the division by electronic means immediately
upon a separation from employment sufficient to enable the division to make a
benefit determination, including any information relevant to whether the
individual may be disqualified pursuant to subsections (a),(b),(d), or (e) of
R.S.43:21-5, shall be supplied by the division to employers without cost to
them.  The directions provided to all employers in advance shall include that
each employer provide the division with an email address for communications to
and from the division.  When an employer provides benefit instructions to the
individual which disclose the date on which unemployment will commence, the
employer shall immediately and simultaneously provide by electronic means that
disclosure to the division together with the information required by the
division pursuant to the directions provided in advance by the division.  An
employer who fails to make the immediate and simultaneous disclosure to the
department as required by this paragraph shall be liable for the penalties
imposed by subsection (b) of R.S.43:21-16 on employers for willful failure to
furnish reports.  The division shall notify the employer by electronic means
not more than seven calendar days after the department receives the disclosure
of any failure of the employer to provide all of the information needed by the
division to make a benefit determination.  Nothing in this section shall be
construed so as to require an employer to re-hire an individual formerly in the
employer's service.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring
the division to issue a benefit determination solely based on the information
supplied by the employer.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section which
require employers to provide information to the division by electronic means,
and the division to provide notifications to an employer by electronic means,
the commissioner shall have the discretion to establish by rule an alternate
method or methods for employers to provide the required information to the
division and for the division to provide the required notifications to an
employer in circumstances where it is established, to the satisfaction of the
commissioner, that the employer is unable to provide the information to the
division or is unable to receive notifications from the division by electronic
means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Any claimant may choose
to certify, cancel or close his claim for unemployment insurance benefits at
any time, 24 hours a day and seven days a week, via the Internet on a website
developed by the division; however, any claim that is certified, cancelled or
closed after 7:00 PM will not be processed by the division until the next
scheduled posting date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  The division may request
that claimants obtain digital identity credentials, but only if the division
provides opportunities for claimants to verify their identities even if they do
not have the knowledge or access to the equipment needed to obtain the digital
identity credentials.  Any request by the division for a claimant to obtain
digital identity credentials shall include a statement that the claimant may
use alternative procedures to verify identification, and fully describe the
alternative procedures, which shall include personal assistance in person or by
phone which shall be made available by representatives of the division as
needed to prevent any delay in processing claims.  If the division requests
that a claimant obtain digital identity credentials, and the claimant chooses
to request a digital identity credential rather than utilize an alternative
procedure, but is denied the digital identity credential, the division shall
issue the claimant a written appealable determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  Any system that the
division establishes for claimants or recipients of benefits to verify
identity, to apply for, or to make appeals regarding, benefits either by phone
or on-line, shall provide a clearly and prominently expressed option for the
claimant or recipient, if not immediately provided personal assistance, to
select from available appointment times an appointment time to speak with a
representative to obtain assistance in verifying identity, filing a claim or
appeal, or obtaining information regarding the status of a claim or appeal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  (1)  Procedure for making
initial determinations with respect to benefit years commencing on or after
January 1, 1953.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A representative or
representatives designated by the director of the division and hereafter
referred to as a &quot;deputy&quot; shall promptly examine any disclosure of
information to the division by an employer required by paragraph (1) of
subsection (a) of this section upon a separation from work and any claim for
benefits, and shall, by electronic means, notify the most recent employing unit
and, successively as necessary, each employer in inverse chronological order
during the base year.  The notification shall be made not later than seven
calendar days after the employer provides to the department the disclosure
required by paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section, or seven calendar
days after the filing of the claim, whichever occurs first, and require said
employing unit and employer to furnish, by electronic means, not more than
seven calendar days after the notification is made, any information to the
deputy which the employer failed to provide as required by paragraph (1) of
subsection (a) of this section as may be necessary to determine the claimant's
eligibility and his benefit rights with respect to the employer in question. 
The claimant shall, at the time the claim is filed, be provided any information
the division has received from the employer upon the separation from work and
an opportunity to respond to that information.  If a claim is filed and the
employer has provided the information required upon separation from work, the
employer shall immediately be notified by electronic means of the opportunity
to provide, by electronic means and in not more than seven calendar days,
additional information in response to the claim for benefits.  If a claim is
filed and the employer has failed to provide the information required upon the
separation from work, the division shall immediately, by electronic means,
request the required information and the employer shall provide the
information, by electronic means and in not more than seven calendar days.  The
division shall provide the claimant any additional information it receives and
an opportunity to respond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If any employer or employing
unit fails to respond to the notification or request within seven calendar days
after a communication by electronic means of the notification or request, the
deputy shall rely entirely on information from other sources, including an
affidavit to the best of the knowledge and belief of the claimant with respect
to his wages and time worked.  Except in the event of a knowing, fraudulent
nondisclosure or misrepresentation by the claimant or his agent, if it is determined
that any information in such affidavit is erroneous, no penalty shall be
imposed on the claimant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The deputy shall make an
initial determination contingent upon the receipt of all necessary information
and notify the claimant no later than three weeks from the date on which the
division received the claim for benefits.  The initial determination shall show
the weekly benefit amount payable, the maximum duration of benefits with
respect to the employer to whom the determination relates, and the ratio of
benefits chargeable to the employer's account for benefit years commencing on
or after July 1, 1986, and also shall show whether the claimant is ineligible
or disqualified for benefits under the initial determination.  The employer
whose account may be charged for benefits payable pursuant to said
determination shall be promptly notified thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever an initial
determination is based upon information other than that supplied by an employer
because such employer failed to provide information as required at the time of
separation from employment, and failed to respond to the deputy's request for
additional information, benefit payments based on the determination shall
commence immediately, and such initial determination and any subsequent determination
thereunder shall be incontestable by the noncomplying employer, as to any
charges to his employer's account because of benefits paid prior to the close
of the calendar week following the receipt of his reply.  Such initial
determination shall be altered if necessary upon receipt of information from
the employer, and any benefits paid or payable with respect to weeks occurring
subsequent to the close of the calendar week following the receipt of the
employer's reply and the determination of the division to alter the initial
determination after providing the claimant the information and an opportunity
to respond shall be paid in accordance with such altered initial determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The deputy shall issue a
separate initial benefit determination with respect to each of the claimant's
base year employers, starting with the most recent employer and continuing as
necessary in the inverse chronological order of the claimant's last date of
employment with each such employer.  If an appeal is taken from an initial
determination, as hereinafter provided, by any employer other than the first
chargeable base year employer or for benefit years commencing on or after July
1, 1986, that employer from whom the individual was most recently separated,
then such appeal shall be limited in scope to include only one or more of the
following matters:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (A) The correctness of the
benefit payments authorized to be made under the determination;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B) Fraud in connection with
the claim pursuant to which the initial determination is issued;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (C) The refusal of suitable
work offered by the chargeable employer filing the appeal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (D) Gross misconduct as
provided in subsection (b) of R.S.43:21-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In his discretion, the
director may appoint special deputies to make initial or subsequent determinations
under subsection (f) of R.S.43:21-4 and subsection (d) of R.S.43:21-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The amount of benefits payable
under an initial determination may be reduced or canceled if necessary to avoid
payment of benefits for a number of weeks in excess of the maximum specified in
subsection (d) of R.S.43:21-3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Unless the employer, within
seven calendar days after a confirmed receipt of notification of an initial
determination, including by electronic means, or the claimant, within 21
calendar days after the notification was mailed to the claimant's last-known
address and addresses, files an appeal of the decision, the decision shall be
final and benefits shall immediately be paid or denied in accordance therewith,
except for such determinations as may be altered in benefit amounts or duration
as provided in this paragraph.  An appeal concerning an initial determination
shall not be filed after whichever is applicable of the seven-day or 21-day
period.  Benefits payable for periods pending an appeal shall be paid as such
benefits accrue and be paid according to the initial determination but shall
be, to the extent that the amount paid exceeds the amount determined in the
appeal, regarded as an overpayment subject to the provisions of R.S.43:21-16
regarding overpayments, including the requirement of that section that a
claimant who makes knowing, fraudulent nondisclosure or misrepresentation is
liable to repay the full amount of the overpayment; provided that if the appeal
is an appeal of a determination that the claimant is disqualified under the
provisions of R.S.43:21-5, benefits pending determination of the appeal shall
be withheld only for the period of disqualification as provided for in that
section, and while the appeal is pending, the benefits otherwise provided by
this act shall be paid for the period subsequent to such period of
disqualification; provided further that if it is determined in the appeal that
the claimant was not disqualified, the claimant shall be paid the benefits due
for the period of the disqualification, except that no such benefits shall be
paid to the claimant for any week during which the claimant has failed to
provide to the division a weekly certification evidencing the claimant's
eligibility for benefits; and provided, also, that if there are two
determinations of entitlement, benefits for the period covered by such
determinations shall be paid regardless of any appeal which may thereafter be
taken, but no employer's account shall be charged with benefits so paid, if the
decision is finally reversed.  If an employer appeals the charging of benefits
to the employer's account after the seven-day period to appeal the initial
benefit determination, and, as a result of the appeal on the charging to the
employer's account, the division, after the claimant is notified and given the
opportunity to respond, reduces the amount charged to the employer's account,
any resulting reduction in the amount of benefits shall take effect only after
the resolution of the appeal of the charging, and any amount of benefits paid
before the resolution of the appeal of the charging which exceeds the amount
determined in that appeal shall be regarded as an overpayment caused by
employer error and shall be charged to the employer's account, and the claimant
shall not be liable to repay any portion of that overpayment where the
overpayment is of regular Unemployment Compensation.  In the case of the
recovery of an overpayment of benefit under any of the following programs
authorized by the federal &quot;Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
(CARES) Act,&quot; Pub.L.116-136: Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation
(FPUC), Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), Mixed Earners
Unemployment Compensation (MEUC), Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), or the
first week of regular Unemployment Compensation that is reimbursed in
accordance with Section 2105 of the CARES Act, a recovery shall not be waived
unless the division determines that the claimant is without fault and the
repayment would be contrary to equity and good conscience.</p>

P.L.2022, c.120)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Procedure for making
subsequent determinations with respect to benefit years commencing on or after
January 1, 1953.  The deputy shall make determinations with respect to claims
for benefits thereafter in the course of the benefit year, in accordance with
any initial determination allowing benefits, and under which benefits have not
been exhausted, and each notification of a benefit payment shall be a
notification of an affirmative subsequent determination.  Any change in the
allowance, amount, or other characteristic of benefits by the deputy in any
such determination, or the denial of benefits by the deputy in any such
determination, shall be appealable in the same manner and under the same
limitations as is provided in the case of initial determinations, except that,
after an initial determination, the resolution of any appeal of the initial
determination, and the payment of one or more weeks of benefits pursuant to the
initial determination, if a subsequent determination will result in any
termination or reduction of those benefits from the amount or duration of
benefits specified in the initial determination, the claimant shall be provided
notification with a full written explanation of why the reduction or
termination of benefits will occur, and provided, during the seven calendar
days following the notification, an opportunity to file an appeal before the
reduction or termination goes into effect.  If the claimant files an appeal
during the seven-day period, benefits shall continue to be paid at the rate,
and for the duration, stipulated in the initial determination until the appeal
is resolved.  If the claimant does not file an appeal, or the claimant files an
appeal and it is found in the resolution of the appeal that the amount in
benefits paid during the processing of the appeal exceeded the amount
determined in the appeal to be correct, or the claimant is found in the appeal
to be ineligible for benefits, any resulting excess payment of benefits shall
be regarded as an overpayment subject to the provisions of R.S.43:21-16
regarding overpayments, including the requirement of that section that a
claimant who makes knowing, fraudulent nondisclosure or misrepresentation is
liable to repay the full amount of the overpayment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)  Appeals.  Unless such
appeal is withdrawn, an appeal tribunal, after affording the parties reasonable
opportunity for fair hearing, shall affirm or modify the findings of fact and
the determination.  The parties shall be duly notified of such tribunal's
decision, together with its reasons therefor, which shall be deemed to be the
final decision of the board of review, unless further appeal is initiated
pursuant to subsection (e) of this section within 20 days after the date of
notification or mailing of such decision for any decision made after December
1, 2010.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)  Appeal tribunals.  To
hear and decide disputed benefit claims, including appeals from determinations
with respect to demands for refunds of benefits under subsection (d) of
R.S.43:21-16, the director with the approval of the Commissioner of Labor and
Workforce Development shall establish impartial appeal tribunals consisting of
a salaried body of examiners under the supervision of a Chief Appeals Examiner,
all of whom shall be appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 11A of the
New Jersey Statutes, Civil Service and other applicable statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)  Board of review.  The
board of review may on its own motion affirm, modify, or set aside any decision
of an appeal tribunal on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in such
case, or direct the taking of additional evidence, or may permit any of the
parties to such decision to initiate further appeals before it.  The board of
review shall permit such further appeal by any of the parties interested in a
decision of an appeal tribunal which is not unanimous and from any
determination which has been overruled or modified by any appeal tribunal.  The
board of review may remove to itself or transfer to another appeal tribunal the
proceedings on any claim pending before an appeal tribunal.  Any proceedings so
removed to the board of review shall be heard by a quorum thereof in accordance
with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section.  The board of review
shall promptly notify the interested parties of its findings and decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)  Procedure.  The manner in
which disputed benefit claims, and appeals from determinations with respect to
(1) claims for benefits and (2) demands for refunds of benefits under
subsection (d) of R.S.43:21-16 shall be presented, the reports thereon required
from the claimant and from employers, and the conduct of hearings and appeals
shall be in accordance with rules prescribed by the board of review for determining
the rights of the parties, whether or not such rules conform to common law or
statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of procedure.  A full and
complete record shall be kept of all proceedings in connection with a disputed
claim.  All testimony at any hearing upon a disputed claim shall be recorded,
but need not be transcribed unless the disputed claim is further appealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)  Witness fees.  Witnesses
subpoenaed pursuant to this section shall be allowed fees at a rate fixed by
the director.  Such fees and all expenses of proceedings involving disputed
claims shall be deemed a part of the expense of administering this chapter
(R.S.43:21-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)  Court review.  Any
decision of the board of review shall become final as to any party upon the
mailing of a copy thereof to such party and to the party's attorney, or upon
the mailing of a copy thereof to such party at his last-known address and to
the party's attorney.  The Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability
Insurance and any party to a proceeding before the board of review may secure
judicial review of the final decision of the board of review.  Any party not
joining in the appeal shall be made a defendant; the board of review shall be
deemed to be a party to any judicial action involving the review of, or appeal
from, any of its decisions, and may be represented in any such judicial action
by any qualified attorney, who may be a regular salaried employee of the board
of review or has been designated by it for that purpose, or, at the board of
review's request, by the Attorney General.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)  Failure to give notice. 
The failure of any public officer or employee at any time heretofore or
hereafter to give notice of determination or decision required in subsections
(b), (c) and (e) of this section, as originally passed or amended, shall not
relieve any employer's account of any charge by reason of any benefits paid,
unless and until that employer can show to the satisfaction of the director of
the division that the said benefits, in whole or in part, would not have been
charged or chargeable to his account had such notice been given.  Any
determination hereunder by the director shall be subject to court review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (j)  With respect to benefit
payments made on or after October 22, 2013, an employer's account shall not be
relieved of charges related to a benefit payment that was made erroneously from
the division if it is determined that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  The erroneous benefit
payment was made because the employer, or an agent of the employer, failed to
respond in a timely or adequate manner to a request from the division for

information required by subsection (a) of this section upon a separation from
employment; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The employer, or an agent
of the employer, has established a pattern of failing to respond in a timely or
adequate manner to requests from the division for information related to claims
for benefits, including failing to provide the information required by
subsection (a) of this section upon a separation from employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Determinations of the division
prohibiting the relief of charges pursuant to this subsection shall be subject
to appeal in the same manner as other determinations of the division related to
the charging of employer accounts.</p>

of this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Erroneous benefit
payment&quot; means a benefit payment that, except for the failure by the
employer, or an agent of the employer, to respond in a timely or adequate manner

benefits, would not have been made; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Pattern of failing&quot;
means repeated documented failure on the part of the employer, or an agent of
the employer, to respond to requests from the division to the employer or
employer's agent for information related to a claim for benefits, including
failing to provide the information required by subsection (a) of this section
upon a separation from employment, except that an employer, or an agent of an
employer, shall not be determined to have engaged in a &quot;pattern of
failing&quot; if the number of failures to provide the required information or
respond to requests from the division for information related to claims for
benefits during the previous 365 calendar days is less than three, or if the
number of failures is less than two percent of the number of requests from the
division, whichever is greater.</p>
