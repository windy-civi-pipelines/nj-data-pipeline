STATEMENT This bill revises State law governing craft distillery licenses to increase production limits from 20,000 gallons to 100,000 gallons, eliminate the tour requirement for selling beverages for consumption on premises, and permit the sale or offering of snacks to consumers. Under current law, the holder of a craft distillery license is entitled to manufacture not more than 20,000 gallons of distilled alcoholic beverages to sell and distribute to wholesalers and retailers.  These licensees also are authorized to sell their product at retail to consumers on the licensed premises for on-site consumption, but only in connection with a tour of the distillery.  Additionally, under current law the holder of each craft distillery license is prohibited from selling food or operating a restaurant on the licensed premises. Under this bill, the holder of a craft distillery license no longer would be restricted to producing no more than 20,000 gallons or be required to provide a tour of the distillery to sell their products for consumption on the licensed premises. The licensee also would be permitted to sell or offer packaged crackers, chips, nuts, and similar snacks to consumers on the premises.  Under the bill, licensees continue to be prohibited from operating a restaurant on the premises, consistent with current law.

STATEMENT This bill revises State law governing craft distillery licenses to increase production limits from 20,000 gallons to 100,000 gallons, eliminate the tour requirement for selling beverages for consumption on premises, and permit the sale or offering of snacks to consumers. Under current law, the holder of a craft distillery license is entitled to manufacture not more than 20,000 gallons of distilled alcoholic beverages to sell and distribute to wholesalers and retailers.  These licensees also are authorized to sell their product at retail to consumers on the licensed premises for on-site consumption, but only in connection with a tour of the distillery.  Additionally, under current law the holder of each craft distillery license is prohibited from selling food or operating a restaurant on the licensed premises. Under this bill, the holder of a craft distillery license no longer would be restricted to producing no more than 20,000 gallons or be required to provide a tour of the distillery to sell their products for consumption on the licensed premises. The licensee also would be permitted to sell or offer packaged crackers, chips, nuts, and similar snacks to consumers on the premises.  Under the bill, licensees continue to be prohibited from operating a restaurant on the premises, consistent with current law.
