Any emergency vehicle authorized by the commission may be equipped with a siren, whistle, or bell capable of emitting sound audible under normal conditions from a distance of not less than 500 feet and of a type approved by the commission, but such siren, whistle or bell shall not be used except when such vehicle is operated in response to an emergency call or in the immediate pursuit of an actual or suspected violator of the law, in which said latter events the driver of such vehicle shall sound said siren, whistle or bell when necessary to warn pedestrians and other drivers of the approach thereof. c.   No person, including, but not limited to, an auto body repair facility, shall install or modify the exhaust system of any motor vehicle [any device which emits an] in a manner which amplifies or increases the audible sound [unless authorized to do so by the commission] emitted by the motor or exhaust system of such vehicle above that emitted by the motor or exhaust system originally installed on the vehicle. The penalty for the violation of this subsection shall be consistent with the penalty for violating the provisions of subsection b. of R.S.39:3-70. d.   No bicycle shall be equipped with nor shall any person use upon a bicycle any siren or whistle. e.   The commission is hereby authorized in its discretion to promulgate standards concerning the audibility of audible warning devices. f.    Except as provided for in subsection c. of this section, the penalty for violating the provisions of this section shall be consistent with the penalty for violating the provisions of this article, as provided for in R.S.39:3-79. g. As used in this section, auto body repair facility means the same as the term is defined in section 1 of P.L.1983, c.360 (C.39:13-1).
