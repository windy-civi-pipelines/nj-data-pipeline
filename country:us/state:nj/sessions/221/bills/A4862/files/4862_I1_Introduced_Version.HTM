informational meeting to discuss a proposed project and answer questions so
long as the meeting is open to all prospective developers.  A pilot agency may
host an Internet website to answer questions submitted by prospective developers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  A pilot agency shall
conduct a preliminary review of the proposals received from prospective developers
to determine which proposals meet the minimum qualifications and standards. The
review of proposals shall be conducted in a manner that avoids disclosure of
the contents of a proposal to prospective developers that submitted competing
proposals. A pilot agency may conduct discussions with a prospective developer
that submitted a qualified proposal for the purpose of clarifying information
submitted in the proposal.  After completing a preliminary review of the
proposals submitted by prospective developers, a pilot agency may revise its request
for proposal documentation if the pilot agency simultaneously provides notice
of the revision to each prospective developer that submitted a proposal and
provides a uniform and reasonable period of time within which a prospective developer
that submitted a proposal may submit a revised proposal to the pilot
agency.      </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  (1)  A pilot agency shall
appoint the agencys purchasing agent, legal counsel, engineer, administrator,
or other qualified person, to evaluate submitted proposals in accordance with
the methodology set forth in the request for proposals.  The governing body may
create a committee to assist the evaluating appointee in the effort.  After
completing the evaluation of submitted proposals, the person appointed to
evaluate proposals shall prepare a report explaining the evaluations and making
recommendations, which may include recommending the award of a contract or
contracts to a prospective developer.  The report shall list each prospective
developer and shall summarize each submitted proposal.  The report shall rank prospective
developers in order of preference, and may recommend the selection of a
developer.  If the report recommends the selection of a developer, the report
shall clearly state the reasons for recommending selection of the prospective
developer over other prospective developers.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The pilot agency shall
make the report available to the public, and to each prospective developer that
submitted a proposal, at least 48 hours prior to announcing selection of a
prospective developer and entering into negotiations with the selected
prospective developer.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  After receipt and review
of the report, and at least 48 hours after making the report available to the
public and each prospective developer, the governing body of a pilot agency may,
by resolution, select a prospective developer and authorize the pilot agency to
enter into negotiations for a power purchase agreement with the selected prospective
developer.  If the governing body selects a prospective developer other than
the highest ranked developer, the governing body shall include an explanation
for doing so in the resolution.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  The governing body of a
pilot agency may reject all proposals for any of the reasons set forth in

negotiate a preliminary project agreement and a preliminary power purchase
agreement with the selected prospective developer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  If a pilot agency is
unable to negotiate satisfactory preliminary agreements with the selected prospective
developer, the pilot agency may, by resolution, abandon negotiations with that
prospective developer and select the next-highest-ranked prospective developer. 
The pilot agency shall notify each prospective developer that submitted a
proposal of the selection of the next-highest-ranked prospective developer at
least 48 hours prior to commencing negotiations with the next-highest-ranked
prospective developer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  A pilot agency, the
selected prospective developer, and the applicable electrical distribution
company shall consult on issues relevant to the development and operation of a
proposed project, and shall negotiate the provisions of a proposed microgrid
tariff for the purpose of enabling a proposed project to operate in a manner
consistent with sound distribution grid engineering, safety requirements,
economics, and cross-subsidy standards.  An electrical distribution company shall
not unreasonably withhold its agreement to a proposed microgrid tariff and
shall negotiate in good faith with the pilot agency and the selected
prospective developer in order to facilitate the proposed project.  The terms
and conditions of the proposed microgrid tariff shall be contingent upon
approval by the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  If the pilot agency, the
selected prospective developer, and the applicable electrical distribution
company agree to the provisions of a proposed microgrid tariff, the electrical
distribution company shall submit the proposed microgrid tariff to the board
for the boards approval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  If the pilot agency, the
selected prospective developer, and the applicable electrical distribution
company cannot agree on all necessary provisions of a proposed microgrid
tariff, the electrical distribution company shall provide the pilot agency and
the selected prospective developer a written statement setting forth each issue
necessary to be addressed in the tariff, indicating whether the parties have
agreed on each issue, and explaining the  electrical distribution companys
recommendations on each issue of disagreement.  In this instance, the
application for review and approval of the proposed agreement, submitted
pursuant to subsection h. of this section, shall include the pilot agencys
recommendations and the selected prospective developers recommendations on
each issue of disagreement together with the electrical distribution companys
written statement on the proposed microgrid tariff.  As part of its action on
the application, the board shall consider the submitted recommendations on each
issue of disagreement and make a determination to resolve each issue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  After satisfactory
completion of negotiations with a prospective developer, a pilot agency shall
set forth in a written document a summary of the terms and conditions of the
proposed agreements and shall, upon request, make this document available to
the public along with the proposed agreements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  Prior to entering into a
project agreement and a power purchase agreement with a prospective developer,
a pilot agency shall conduct a public hearing on the proposed agreements. The
pilot agency shall provide at least 14 days' prior notice of the public hearing
by publication in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the
jurisdiction or service area of the pilot agency to be served under the terms
of the proposed agreement and by posting notice of the public hearing on the
website of the pilot agency.  The publication shall include notice of the date,
time and place of the public hearing, and provide notice of the place and
times, or Internet website at which, a member of the public may review the
proposed agreements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  A pilot agency shall
produce a verbatim record of the public hearing. The pilot agency shall prepare
a written hearing report, which shall include a copy of the proposed
agreements, a copy of the statement setting forth the pilot agencys reasons
for selecting the proposal, the verbatim record of the public hearing, written
statements submitted by interested parties, and a statement prepared by the
pilot agency summarizing the major issues raised at the public hearing and the pilot
agency 's specific responses to those issues. The pilot agency shall make
copies of the hearing report available to interested parties upon their
request. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  (1)  Upon at least 10
days' prior written notice provided after the close of a public hearing on a
proposed project agreement and a proposed power purchase agreement, a pilot

written comments to the division, the board, and the pilot agency, for their
consideration, no later than 45 days after the departments receipt of an
application, or within 10 days of being notified by the division or board of
their intent to act on the application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Within 60 days of receipt
of an application, the board and the division shall each approve, disapprove,
or conditionally approve, the application.  The board and the division shall
disapprove an application unless it was initially submitted for review within
three years of the effective date of this act.  If the board or division does
not approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve an application within 60 days
of receipt, the application shall be deemed approved, unless the public agency
agrees to an extension of the period or the application was not submitted
within three years of the effective date of this act.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) If the board or division
conditionally approves an application, the board or division shall provide the
pilot agency suggested changes or language for a required revision to the
proposed agreement or tariff, in writing, inclusion of which would enable the
board or division to approve the proposed agreement or tariff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  If the board or division
determines that the required revision is substantial, the pilot agency shall
hold a public hearing on the revision.  A substantial revision shall be a
change that materially changes the terms and conditions of the proposed agreement
or tariff.  A pilot agency shall submit a proposed revision to the board, the
division, and the department at least 15 days prior to the date of the public
hearing.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  If the board or division
determines that the required revision is not substantial, the pilot agency
shall submit the proposed revision to the board and the division for approval
and to the department for review.  The board and the division, at their next
public meetings held at least 15 days after submission of a proposed revision,
shall either: approve the proposed revision, if it is found to be consistent
with the conditions set forth in the conditional approval; or disapprove the
proposed revision with a written explanation as to why the revision is not
consistent with the conditions set forth in the conditional approval.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  In its review of an
application, the board shall apply the following criteria in determining
whether to approve a proposed power purchase agreement and microgrid
tariff:     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  The prospective developer
has the financial capacity and technical and administrative experience to
ensure continuity of service over the term of the agreement and tariff and that
the standards and requirements contained in the application documents
concerning the financial, technical and administrative capacity of the prospective
developer are necessary and sufficient to protect the public interest.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  The terms of the proposed
power purchase agreement and microgrid tariff are not unreasonable.  In
determining whether the terms of the proposed agreement and tariff are not
unreasonable, the board shall review the fees and charges to be charged or
assessed under the proposed agreement and tariff to determine that they are
reasonable to the pilot agency, taking into consideration all the obligations
to be undertaken by the prospective developer and all the benefits to be
obtained by the pilot agency.  In making this determination, the board shall
not use the traditional rate-based rate of return methodology, pursuant to the
provisions of Title 48 of the Revised Statutes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)  The franchise customers
of a public utility are protected from the risks of the proposed power purchase
agreement and are not subsidizing the agreement.  If a prospective developer is
not a public utility, the board shall ensure that the terms of the proposed
power purchase agreement address the risks the agreement imposes on all
offtakers, and that users of electricity who are not part of the TCDER
microgrid are not subsidizing the agreement through increased charges, rates,
or fees.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)  If a prospective developer
is not an electrical distribution company, the prospective developer shall not
be subject to laws, rules, and regulations applicable to regulated public
utilities, except for the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable microgrid
tariff.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)  A microgrid tariff may

public utility to recover costs of switches and related costs of integrating
microgrid generated energy into their system. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii)  provisions addressing
the assessment of standby, access, and social benefit, market transition fees,
rates, or charges.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iv)  provisions allowing an
electric public utility to own and maintain distribution wiring, switches, and

the cost of the added distribution infrastructure is passed on to the customers
of the TCDER Microgrid over the life of that infrastructure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (vi)  provisions that
supersede other statutes and regulations, upon the boards determination that
it is necessary, appropriate, and in the public interest to do so, in order to
facilitate the success of the proposed project and power purchase agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  In its review of an
application, the division shall apply the following criteria in determining
whether to approve a proposed power purchase agreement:     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  The terms of the proposed
power purchase agreement do not materially impair the ability of the pilot
agency to punctually pay principal and interest due on its outstanding
indebtedness and to supply other essential public improvements and services.   
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) The power purchase
agreement contains satisfactory provisions addressing:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)  The allocation of the
risks of operating and maintaining the microgrid.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)  The allocation of the
financial risks of the power purchase agreement.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii)  The defaulting and
termination of the agreement.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iv)  The requirements for the
provision of a performance bond by the developer, if so required by the pilot
agency.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The division shall also review
and specifically approve any agreement provision pursuant to which a pilot
agency may execute a financing instrument for the purposes set forth in the
agreement.  A bond authorization or other obligation that pledges the full
faith and credit of a pilot agency shall be subject to the approval of the
Local Finance Board. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The board and the
division shall assess, and the pilot agency shall pay, a fee equal to the cost
incurred by the board or division for an analysis of an application by an
independent person who has expertise in the area of electric supply services if
during the review of an application the board or division determine that such
an analysis is required and a person with the required expertise is not readily
available from within any executive department of the State government.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   If the pilot agency and
the developer require amendments to a power purchase agreement after approval
of an application by the board and division, the pilot agency shall submit
proposed amendments to the board and division for approval and to the department
for review.  At the next public meeting of the board and of the division
convened at least 20 days after receipt of proposed amendments, the board and
the division shall determine whether the proposed amendments are substantial. 
If the amendments are substantial in nature, as determined by either the board
or the division, the pilot agency shall conduct a hearing on the proposed
revision.  Within 45 days of the receipt of proposed amendments that are not
determined to be substantial, or within 60 days of the receipt of an
application for approval of proposed amendments that are determined to be
substantial, the board and division shall approve or conditionally approve the
amendments in accordance with the applicable procedures established for approval
of an original agreement.       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish the
&quot;New Jersey Town Center Microgrid Pilot Program Act,&quot; for the purpose
of facilitating implementation of a program currently before the New Jersey
Board of Public Utilities (BPU).  The BPU initiated the Town Center Distributed
Energy Resources (TCDER) Microgrid program after Superstorm Sandy in order to
help New Jersey become more energy resilient, particularly with respect to
critical facilities.  A TCDER Microgrid is a cluster of critical facilities
within a municipal boundary, which facilities may operate as shelter for the
public during and after an emergency event or provide services that are
essential to function during and after an emergency situation.  A microgrid
connects critical facilities with distributed energy resources, which can
operate when the main electric grid suffers a power outage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     During 2018, the BPUs Phase
I TCDER Microgrid Feasibility Study Incentive Program funded thirteen
Feasibility Studies. During 2019, BPU informed twelve Feasibility Study
applicants that their studies met program requirements and that they were
eligible to apply for the Phase II TCDER Microgrid incentive program (one
Feasibility Study applicant withdrew from the program). The BPU limited
eligibility to apply for the Phase II TCDER Microgrid Incentive Program to
those applicants who met the Feasibility Study program requirements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Phase II TCDER Microgrid
Incentive Program provides funding, on a competitive basis, for the design of a
TCDER Microgrid, in order to help move projects towards the development and
construction phase.  Phase II TCDER Microgrid Incentive Program guidelines
require applicants to certify that projects are legally permissible, i.e., that
they conform to existing law, code, and standing Board Orders.  This bill
establishes a framework to enable program participants that are unable to move
their projects forward due to legal or statutory impediments to do so consistent
with this process.  Those program participants, defined as pilot agencies in
the bill, are Atlantic City, Camden County and its utilities authority,
Galloway Township, Highland Park Borough, Hoboken City, Hudson County,
Middletown Township, Montclair Township, Neptune Township, Paterson City,
Trenton City (together with the State Department of Treasury), and Woodbridge
Township.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a pilot agency
may enter into a project agreement, concerning the development of a TCDER
Microgrid, and a power purchase agreement, concerning the procurement of
electrical power supply for critical facilities.  A pilot agency and a
developer may enter into a power purchase agreement, for a term not to exceed
20 years, subject to the review and approval of the Division of Local
Government Services (DLGS) and the BPU.  The DLGS would have power to review
and approve financial matters and risks associated with a proposed power
purchase agreement.  The BPU would have power to: review and approve electrical
supply and distribution matters for a proposed power purchase agreement;
provide guidance concerning offtaker rates and fees that are necessary for a
proposed power purchase agreement; and adopt specifically authorized microgrid
tariffs affecting the electrical distribution company in order to facilitate
the development of a TCDER Microgrid project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill sets forth a
procurement process, outside of the &quot;Local Public Contracts Law,&quot; for
a pilot agency to solicit a developer, with whom it would enter into a project
agreement and a power purchase agreement.  After completing a request for
proposals process, the bill authorizes a pilot agency to select a prospective
developer, by resolution, and to enter into negotiations for a power purchase
agreement with the selected developer.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A pilot agency that intends to
enter into a project agreement and a power purchase agreement with a developer
must conduct a public hearing on the proposed agreements.  Within 30 days after

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A pilot agency must submit
initial applications within three years of the effective date of this bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs BPU and DLGS
to specify application forms and processes for a pilot agency to seek approvals
under the bill.  The DLGS would assist pilot agencies in developing procurement
processes and requests for proposals.  The BPU would assist pilot agencies in
evaluating provisions of proposed power purchase agreements and tariffs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would allow a pilot
agency to submit to the DLGS a request for a waiver of specific provisions of
law that are within the divisions jurisdiction.  The division may grant a
request for a waiver and may adopt alternative provisions upon a finding of
public need for the project and general consistency with the applicable
provisions of law, if the division determines that enforcing the requirements
sought to be waived: is not necessary to protect the overall public interest
and may compromise viability of the proposed TCDER microgrid project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would empower the BPU
and the DLGS to each take actions not specifically authorized under the bill
which the board or division deems reasonable, prudent, and necessary to
accomplish the bills purposes if those actions are consistent with the bills
purposes and address issues not specifically covered by the bill.  For this
purpose, the bill specifies that the purposes of the bill are to encourage
energy efficiency, reliability, resiliency, sound technical development and
operation, while ensuring fiscal integrity of each pilot agency and its power
purchase or related agreements with a TCDER microgrid developer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the DLGS, the
BPU, and the DEP to coordinate their reviews, insofar as practicable, and to
engage in discussions with each other and the pilot agency to address any
concerns.  Within 60 days of receipt of an application, the board and the
division must each either approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the
application.  The board and the division shall disapprove an application unless
it was initially submitted for review within three years of the effective date
of this act.  If the board or division does not approve, disapprove, or
conditionally approve an application within 60 days of receipt, the application
would be deemed approved, unless the public agency has agreed to an extension
of the review period or the application was not submitted within three years of
the effective date of this act.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the board or division
conditionally approve an application, the board or division must provide the
pilot agency suggested language for a required revision to the proposed
agreement or tariff, in writing, inclusion of which would enable the board or
division to approve the proposed agreement or tariff.  If the board or division
determines that the required revision is substantial, the pilot agency must
hold a public hearing on the revision.  The bill provides that a substantial
revision would be a change that materially changes the terms and conditions of
the proposed agreement or tariff.  If the board or division determines that the
required revision is not substantial, the pilot agency must submit the proposed
revision to the board and the division for approval and to the department for
review.  The board and the division would approve the proposed revision, if it
is found to be consistent with the conditions set forth in the conditional
approval, or disapprove the application with a written explanation as to why
the revision is not consistent with the conditions set forth in the conditional
approval.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill sets forth criteria
that the BPU and the DLGS would apply when determining whether to approve a
proposed power purchase agreement and tariff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs BPU in
consultation with the DLGS and the DEP, to prepare a report describing
implementation of the bill, and submit the report to the Governor and to the
Legislature within four years of the bills effective date.</p>
