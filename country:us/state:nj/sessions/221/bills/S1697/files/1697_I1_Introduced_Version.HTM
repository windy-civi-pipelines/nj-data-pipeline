Upon conviction the court shall collect forthwith the New Jersey driver's licenses of the person and forward the license or licenses to the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission along with a report indicating the first and last day of the suspension or postponement period imposed by the court pursuant to this section. If the court is for any reason unable to collect the license or licenses of the person, the court shall forward a report of the conviction or adjudication of delinquency to be filed with the chief administrator.  That report shall include the complete name, address, date of birth, eye color, and sex of the person and shall indicate the first and last day of the suspension or postponement period imposed by the court pursuant to this section.  The court shall inform the person orally and in writing that if the person is convicted of personally operating a motor vehicle during the period of license suspension or postponement imposed pursuant to this section the person shall, upon conviction, be subject to the penalties set forth in R.S.39:3-40.  A person shall be required to acknowledge receipt of the written notice in writing. Failure to receive a written notice or failure to acknowledge in writing the receipt of a written notice shall not be a defense to a subsequent charge of a violation of R.S.39:3-40.  If the person is the holder of a driver's license from another jurisdiction, the court shall not collect the license but shall notify the director who shall notify the appropriate officials in the licensing jurisdiction. The court shall, however, in accordance with the provisions of this section, revoke the person's non-resident driving privileges in this State. c.     All penalties provided for in this section shall be collected as provided for the collection of fines and restitutions in section 3 of P.L.1979, c.396 (C.2C:46-4), and shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.2C:64-6 as if the collected monies were the proceeds of property forfeited pursuant to the provisions of chapter 64.  However, the distributed monies are to be used for law enforcement activities related to auto theft. d.    A person who is less than 18 years of age who commits theft or unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of N.J.S.2C:20-2 or N.J.S.2C:20-10 may be sentenced to a home detention program pursuant to this subsection.  The person sentenced to a home detention program may leave the residence to: (1) attend in-person court appearances; (2) attend in-person probation appointments; (3) attend in-person attorney appointments after providing proper notice; or (4) for any other reason preapproved by court order. (cf: P.L.2019, c.276, s.3). 3.    (New Section)  In the case of a person who is less than 18 years of age and is arrested for a violation of N.J.S.2C:20-2, N.J.S.2C:20-10, or P.L.1993, c.221 (C.2C:15-2) the court shall schedule a hearing within 48 hours of the arrest of the person. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases the penalties for the theft of a motor vehicle generally, and, for minors who commit theft of a motor vehicle. The bill upgrades the crime of theft of a motor vehicle to a second degree crime.  Under current law theft of a motor vehicle is a crime of the third degree, which is punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A second degree crime is punishable by five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both. The bill also permits a court to order a minor who is convicted of theft or unlawful taking of a motor vehicle to home detention.  A minor sentenced to home detention may leave the residence to: (1) attend in-person court appearances; (2) attend in-person probation appointments; (3) attend in-person attorney appointments after providing proper notice; or (4) for any other reason preapproved by court order. Finally, the bill requires courts to hear the case of a minor within 48 hours of the arrest when the minor commits motor vehicle theft, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle (joyriding), or carjacking.
