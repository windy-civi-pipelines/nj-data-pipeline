S273 SENATE, No. 273 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  BRIAN P. STACK District 33 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS Palisades Cliffs Protection and Planning Act; concerns preservation of Palisades cliffs and creates Palisades Cliffs Preservation Council. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the preservation of the Palisades cliffs, creating the Palisades Cliffs Preservation Council, and supplementing P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the Palisades Cliffs Protection and Planning Act. 2.    The Legislature finds and declares: a.     The Palisades Cliffs are a geological feature along the Hudson River that extends from New York State south into Bergen and Hudson Counties in New Jersey, and terminating in Jersey City New Jersey; b.    The Palisades Cliffs exist in several municipalities and two counties in New Jersey and dramatically define the scenic view of New Jersey north of Jersey City from the Hudson River and New York City and southern New York State; c.     The Palisades Cliffs are a recognized natural treasure that has been intentionally preserved for decades; d.    While significant portions of the Palisades Cliffs are protected based on their inclusion within parklands under the jurisdiction of the Palisades Park Commission, other portions of the Palisades Cliffs are threatened due to varied zoning ordinances and varied planning rules in municipalities through which the Palisades Cliffs run; e.     As a result of the natural beauty of the Palisades Cliffs and the views of the Hudson River and New York City, there is extensive pressure on municipalities to allow overdevelopment immediately east of the Palisades Cliffs; f.     While some municipalities have encouraged development with reasonable restrictions east of the Palisades Cliffs, other municipalities have adopted ordinances and approved development that fails to preserve the Palisades Cliffs; g.    As a result of the development pressure along the Palisades Cliffs, municipalities have failed to consider the impact of overdevelopment on surrounding municipalities; h.    The overdevelopment of the Palisades Cliffs also increases traffic congestion along the Palisades Cliffs, and this is particularly problematic in the areas where there is a narrow land mass east of the Palisades Cliffs, which does not allow for multiple roads or access points to those roads; i.     Development along the Palisades Cliffs does not just impact a single municipality, but also has a dramatic impact on both the Palisades Cliffs and the residents of surrounding municipalities; j.     Significant components of the natural beauty of the Palisades Cliffs already have been lost to development, and the pace of development in the region has and will continue to dramatically increase, further impairing this natural treasure; k.    The existing system of fragmented controls on development along the Palisades Cliffs is failing to protect the Palisades Cliffs; l.     Protection of the Palisades Cliffs is an issue of Statewide concern and importance that cannot be left to the uncoordinated land use decisions of the municipalities, counties, and myriad private landowners in the area of the Palisades Cliffs; and m.   It is in the public interest of all the citizens of the State that New Jersey enact legislation setting forth a comprehensive development plan in the area of the Palisades Cliffs, so that reasonable development is encouraged, but overdevelopment is prevented. 3.    As used in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Cliff face means that portion of the Palisades cliffs consisting of sheer, nearly vertical expanse of exposed rock. Council means the Palisades Protection and Planning Council established by section 4 of P.L.    , c.

The bill provides that unless approved by the council, no development may be constructed in the Palisades Planning Region unless the maximum height of the proposed development, including any mechanical structures to be constructed atop the building or structure, is at or below the height whereby the sightline looking east from the crest directly to the west of the proposed development would include at least the eastern half of the Hudson River above the proposed building or structure.  Where there is no discernable crest immediately to the west of the proposed development, except as otherwise specified in this bill, the height of the beginning of the sightline looking east would be the elevation of the surface of the portion of Palisades Avenue directly west of the proposed building or structure. Under the bill, on or before March 31 in each year, the council is required to make an annual report of its activities for the preceding calendar year to the governing body and the chief executive officer of the municipalities and Bergen and Hudson counties.  Each such report shall set forth a complete operating and financial statement covering its operations during the preceding year.

STATEMENT This bill, Palisades Cliffs Protection and Planning Act, would provide for the preservation of the Palisades cliffs and create the Palisades Cliffs Preservation Council. The council created by the bill would constitute a political subdivision of the State exercising public and essential governmental functions, would have 10 voting members appointed by the governing bodies of the municipalities within the Palisades cliffs area, and would be conferred with powers, duties, and responsibilities associated with preserving and protecting the Palisades cliffs.  Additionally, the bill creates the Palisades Planning Region that would consist of that land within the municipalities which extends up to 2000 feet east of the Palisades cliff crest at each location along the Palisades cliffs. The bill provides that unless approved by the council, no development may be constructed in the Palisades Planning Region unless the maximum height of the proposed development, including any mechanical structures to be constructed atop the building or structure, is at or below the height whereby the sightline looking east from the crest directly to the west of the proposed development would include at least the eastern half of the Hudson River above the proposed building or structure.  Where there is no discernable crest immediately to the west of the proposed development, except as otherwise specified in this bill, the height of the beginning of the sightline looking east would be the elevation of the surface of the portion of Palisades Avenue directly west of the proposed building or structure. Under the bill, on or before March 31 in each year, the council is required to make an annual report of its activities for the preceding calendar year to the governing body and the chief executive officer of the municipalities and Bergen and Hudson counties.  Each such report shall set forth a complete operating and financial statement covering its operations during the preceding year.
