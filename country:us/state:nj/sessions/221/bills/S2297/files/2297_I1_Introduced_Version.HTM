54A of the New Jersey Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.    (1)  A taxpayer
shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), in an amount equal to 35 percent of the
taxpayers qualified solar energy system expenditures, provided that the
expenditures are certified by the commissioner pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The amount of the tax
credit allowed to a taxpayer annually pursuant to this section shall not
exceed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   $5,000 per taxpayer for
residential property;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   $350 per residential
unit per taxpayer for apartment buildings; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   $500,000 per taxpayer
for commercial property and industrial property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  To qualify for the
tax credit allowed pursuant to this section, the taxpayer shall file an
application for a certification from the commissioner that expenditures made by
the taxpayer are qualified solar energy system expenditures.  The commissioner
may require the submission of any additional information the commissioner deems
necessary to make a certification.  The application and certification shall specify
the amount paid for the purchase and installation of the solar energy system
equipment, the terms of the leasing agreement under which the taxpayer leases
the equipment, or the terms of a power purchase agreement, as applicable.  The
application and certification shall also include the date of installation, a
description of the solar energy system equipment, and how it is used by the
taxpayer.  The certification shall specify the amount of credit available to
the taxpayer.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The commissioner shall
have 90 days from the date of receipt of a complete application to make a
determination as to the issuance of a certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Upon certification, the
commissioner shall submit a copy thereof to the taxpayer and the director.  In
filing a tax return that includes a claim for the credit allowed pursuant to
this section, the taxpayer shall include a copy of the certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The first privilege
period in which a taxpayer may use a credit allowed under this section is the
privilege period for which the taxpayers application made and filed for a
certification from the commissioner is granted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The amount of any unused
credit may be carried forward, if necessary, for use in each of the seven
privilege periods following the privilege period for which the credit is
allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The order of priority
of the application of the credit allowed pursuant to this section and any other
credits allowed by law shall be as prescribed by the director.  The amount of
the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to
section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 for a privilege period, together with any other
credits allowed against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945,
c.162, shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax liability otherwise due and shall
not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum
provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A credit shall not be
allowed pursuant to this section for qualified solar energy system expenditures
which are included in the calculation of any other credit allowed against the
tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The commissioner shall
establish a tax credit pre-certification process through which a taxpayer can
determine if expected expenditures would qualify for a credit allowed pursuant
to this section.  The tax credit pre-certification process established by the
commissioner may require the submission of written information describing the
solar energy system equipment and how it is used by the taxpayer, the amount
paid for the purchase and installation of the equipment, the terms of the
leasing agreement under which the taxpayer leases the equipment, or the terms
of a power purchase agreement, as applicable.  The commissioner may also require
the submission of any other information deemed relevant by the commissioner to
make a determination.  Obtaining pre-certification from the commissioner shall
not be required to qualify for a credit allowed pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The commissioner, in
consultation with the director, shall adopt rules and regulations in accordance
with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.),
establishing technical specifications and certification requirements for the
designation of qualified solar energy system expenditures pursuant to this
section.  Such rules and regulations shall include, but need not be limited to,
examples of qualified solar energy system expenditures and the procedures and
forms to apply for a certification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The value of credits
approved by the director and the commissioner pursuant to this section and
section 2 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill) shall not exceed a cumulative total of
$25,000,000 in any fiscal year to apply against the tax imposed pursuant to
section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), and the tax imposed pursuant to the
New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the cumulative total amount
of credits allowed to taxpayers for privilege periods or taxable years
commencing during a single fiscal year under this section and section 2 of
P.L.   , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)
exceeds the amount of credits available in that year, then taxpayers who have first
applied for and have not been allowed a credit amount for that reason shall be
allowed, in the order in which they have submitted an application, the amount
of the tax credit or certificate on the first day of the next succeeding fiscal

energy system expenditures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the

determination as to the issuance of a certification.  If the application is
certified, the commissioner must submit the certification to the Director of
the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury and to the
taxpayer.  The taxpayer then uses that certification when filing a tax return
that includes a claim for the credit.</p>

forward, if necessary, to each of the seven privilege periods or taxable years
following the period or year in which the credit is first allowed, but
stipulates that a credit is not allowed if the qualified solar energy system
expenditures are used to secure another credit in the same or prior period or
year by the same or another taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
commissioner to establish a pre-certification process through which a taxpayer
can determine if expected solar energy system expenditures are eligible for a
credit, and to develop and adopt regulations, in consultation with the Director
of the Division of Taxation, establishing technical specifications and
certification requirements for the qualification of solar energy system
expenditures.  The bill specifies that pre-certification established by the
commissioner may require submission of certain written information describing
the equipment to be purchased and how it is intended to be used or consumed,
but that obtaining pre-certification is not required to qualify for a credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The maximum cumulative amount
