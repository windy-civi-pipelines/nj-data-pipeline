<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises the requirements
for certain medical schools located outside of the United States to operate
clinical clerkship programs in New Jersey by amending P.L.2003, c.133.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, unless a
medical school is already considered an alternatively accredited medical
school, a medical school located outside of the United States can only apply
for the authorization to operate a clinical clerkship program in the State if the
medical school:  (1) is in a country that applies certain accreditation
standards, which have been determined by the National Committee on Foreign
Medical Education and Accreditation (NCFME) within the United States Department
of Education to be comparable to the accreditation standards applied to medical
schools located within the United States; and (2) that continues to meet the
accreditation standards of that country.  Any medical school that satisfies
this criteria and is approved by the Advisory Graduate Medical Education
Council of New Jersey to operate a clinical clerkship program in this State is
deemed to be an alternatively accredited medical school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends these
requirements and permits certain medical schools located outside of the United
States that are accredited by an accrediting body recognized by the World
Federation for Medical Education (WFME) as having accreditation standards
comparable to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) or the American
Osteopathic Association (AOA), to apply for the authorization to operate a
clinical clerkship program in the State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill revises the
requirements for an alternatively accredited medical school to increase the
number of students participating in clinical clerkships or to increase the
number of programs operated by the school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes the Advisory
Graduate Medical Education Council of New Jersey and Advisory Committee on
Alternatively Accredited Medical School Clinical Clerkships within the
Department of Health.  Under current law, these entities were established under
the Commission of Higher Education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the council
to promulgate and maintain a Code of Ethics.  The bill revises the reporting
requirements provided under current law to require the council to annually
submit a report to the Governor and the Senate and General Assembly Health
Committees of the New Jersey Legislature on the council's activities, which
report will include information on:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the number of
institutions that applied, and received approval, to operate a clinical
clerkship program in a hospital in the State, by the hospitals status as a
nonprofit, for-profit, or public hospital and by the jurisdiction in which the
institution is located; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  the number of students
who applied for, and were accepted to, clinical clerkships in this State, by
institution, race, ethnicity, gender and age.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent
that this bill will broaden the pool of medical schools that might be eligible
to operate a clinical clerkship program in the State, by accepting and
considering the applications of medical schools that have been accredited by
standards that have been recognized by either the NCFME or the WFME.  It is the
sponsors belief that this bill might increase the number of clinical <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
clerkship opportunities in the State and the number of medical school students
who complete their medical school training in New Jersey, which would increase
the likelihood that a student will continue to pursue residency and employment
opportunities in New Jersey and thereby increase the supply of physicians in
the State.  </p>
