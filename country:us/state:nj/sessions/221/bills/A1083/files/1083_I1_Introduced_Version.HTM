STATEMENT This bill would amend current statutory provisions of the Local Bond Law, N.J.S.40A:2-1 et seq., and the Local Budget Law, N.J.S.40A:4-1 et seq., to require that prior to the issuance of general obligation bonds by a county or municipality, the bond ordinance authorizing the obligation must be submitted to the voters of the county or municipality, as appropriate, at the general election next following by at least 70 days the final adoption of the ordinance by the local governing body. The bond ordinance must contain a statement of the ways and means, exclusive of loans, by which the local unit shall pay the principal and interest on the bonds, and would take effect upon its approval by a majority of the legally qualified voters voting on the ordinance.  The provisions of the bill would not apply to the issuance of special emergency notes, refunding bonds, bonds issued by a distressed municipality to pay a judgment resulting from a court order, or borrowing by a county in anticipation of State or federal aid for the establishment of a county college.  The bill also contains the language for the bond referendum question to be submitted to the voters. Under current law, local voters do not have the right to vote on the issuance of general obligation bonds, but are required to repay those bonds through their property taxes.  The provisions of this bill would allow the voters of a municipality or county to vote to approve, or disapprove, the issuance of bonds, and thereby exercise some control over their local property taxes.

(cf: P.L.1961, c.22, s.5) 10.  Section 1 of P.L.1965, c.87 (C.40A:4-55.8) is amended to read as follows: 1.    Upon the receipt of a certification from the board of school estimate of the board of trustees of a county college, a county may by a 2/3 vote of its  entire governing body, adopt a resolution authorizing a special emergency appropriation to provide for funds expected to be received as State or Federal aid for the establishment of a county college.  Such resolution shall: (a)   State the amount needed to provide for said State or Federal share based  upon the certification of the board of school estimate. (b)   Set forth the amount appropriated, which shall not be in excess of the amount requested by the board of trustees. (c)   Provide for the borrowing of any amount required in anticipation of the  receipt of State or Federal aid which may subsequently become available, said  borrowing to be by "special county college emergency notes."  Emergency notes issued pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the referendum requirements of subsection d. of N.J.S.40A:2-17 and N.J.S.40A:2-18. (cf: P.L.1965, c.87, s.1) 11.  Section 4 of P.L.1968, c.194 (C.40A:4-55.16) is amended to read as follows: 4.    When any such appropriation is to be financed by borrowing money, the governing body of the local unit shall, by a   2/3   vote of the full membership thereof, adopt a resolution: a.     Setting forth the amount appropriated, and b.    Making provision for the borrowing of money by the issuance of "special  emergency notes" which may be renewed from time to time, but at least 1/3 of all such notes, and the renewals thereof, shall mature and be paid in each  succeeding year so that all notes and renewals shall have matured and have been  paid not later than the last day of the third year following the date of the special emergency resolution. The issuance of special emergency notes pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the referendum requirements of subsection d. of N.J.S.40A:2-17 and N.J.S.40A:2-18. (cf: P.L.1968, c.194, s.4) 12.  Section 2 of P.L.1982, c.66 (C.40A:4-55.19) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  The governing body of a distressed municipality may by resolution approved by not less than two-thirds vote of its full membership provide for the payment of any judgment against it resulting from an order of the court by providing an appropriation therefor, and financing such from surplus funds or by borrowing through issuance of notes or other obligations in the name of the municipality. b.    Any resolution adopted under the provisions of this act shall provide that in the case of any notes issued to finance appropriations, at least one-fifth of all such notes, and any renewals thereof, shall mature and be paid  each year, so that all notes and renewals shall have matured and have been paid not later than the last day of the fifth year following the date of the resolution. The issuance of notes or other obligations issued pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the referendum requirements of subsection d. of N.J.S.40A:2-17 and N.J.S.40A:2-18. (cf: P.L.1982, c.66, s.2) 13.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend current statutory provisions of the Local Bond Law, N.J.S.40A:2-1 et seq., and the Local Budget Law, N.J.S.40A:4-1 et seq., to require that prior to the issuance of general obligation bonds by a county or municipality, the bond ordinance authorizing the obligation must be submitted to the voters of the county or municipality, as appropriate, at the general election next following by at least 70 days the final adoption of the ordinance by the local governing body. The bond ordinance must contain a statement of the ways and means, exclusive of loans, by which the local unit shall pay the principal and interest on the bonds, and would take effect upon its approval by a majority of the legally qualified voters voting on the ordinance.  The provisions of the bill would not apply to the issuance of special emergency notes, refunding bonds, bonds issued by a distressed municipality to pay a judgment resulting from a court order, or borrowing by a county in anticipation of State or federal aid for the establishment of a county college.  The bill also contains the language for the bond referendum question to be submitted to the voters. Under current law, local voters do not have the right to vote on the issuance of general obligation bonds, but are required to repay those bonds through their property taxes.  The provisions of this bill would allow the voters of a municipality or county to vote to approve, or disapprove, the issuance of bonds, and thereby exercise some control over their local property taxes.
