(c)   The term "Governor-elect as used in this act shall mean such person as is the apparent successful candidate for the office of Governor, respectively, as ascertained by the Secretary of State following the general election. (d)   Each Governor-elect shall be entitled to conveyance of all mail matter, including airmail, sent by him in connection with his preparations for the assumption of official duties as Governor. (e)   Each Governor-elect may designate to the director an assistant authorized to make on his behalf such designations or findings of necessity as may be required in connection with the services and facilities to be provided under this act.

(cf: P.L.2005, c.382, s.14) 2.    This act shall take effect January 1 next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill applies the laws governing equal employment opportunity and affirmative action to gubernatorial transition staff. In 1969, New Jersey enacted The Gubernatorial Transition Act in order to promote the orderly transfer of the executive power in connection with the expiration of the term of office of a Governor and the inauguration of a new Governor. Although staff members of the Governor-elects transition office receive compensation through the Department of the Treasury, the act specifically states that members of the gubernatorial transition staff are not considered State employees, except with regard to the Public Employees Retirement System and the New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law. This bill would amend that law to also apply the laws governing equal employment opportunity and affirmative action to gubernatorial transition staff members.
