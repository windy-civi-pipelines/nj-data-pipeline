<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Police and Firemens
Retirement System (PFRS) provides certain benefits upon the death of a member
who is an active employee or is retired.  These benefits are paid to a
surviving spouse or partner.  If there is no such survivor, or if the survivor
dies, remarries or enters a partnership, the benefits are payable to a
surviving child or children.  The statutes define the term child to be an
unmarried child (a) under the age of 18, or (b) 18 years of age or older and
enrolled in a secondary school, or (c) , in the case of an accidental death
benefits only, under the age of 24 and enrolled in a degree program in an
institution of higher education, or (d) of any age who, at the time of the
member's death, is disabled because of an intellectual disability or physical
incapacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that the
term child also means a supplemental needs trust, or special needs trust, the
beneficiary of which is a deceased members unmarried disabled child as
described in (d) above.  Federal law permits the establishment of such trusts
to serve as a secondary source of support to supplement other government
benefits.  Under current law, PFRS death benefits are payable only to an unmarried
disabled child of any age and not to a trust established for that child.  </p>
