This bill provides that the term child also means a supplemental needs trust, or special needs trust, the beneficiary of which is a deceased members unmarried disabled child as described in (d) above.  Federal law permits the establishment of such trusts to serve as a secondary source of support to supplement other government benefits.  Under current law, PFRS death benefits are payable only to an unmarried disabled child of any age and not to a trust established for that child.
