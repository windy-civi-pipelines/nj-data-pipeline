the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of N.J.S.54A:5-1, a taxpayer who is an individual shall be allowed
to deduct from the taxpayer's gross income, for any taxable year beginning on
or after the effective date of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill), the eligible gain from the sale
or exchange of qualified small business stock held for more than five years, in
accordance with the maximum allowable deductions established pursuant to subsection
b. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1) If the taxpayer has
eligible gain for the taxable year from one or more dispositions of qualified
small business stock, the aggregate amount of the gain from dispositions of
stock issued by the corporation which may be taken into account for the taxable
year shall be determined as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) If at least 80 percent of
the corporations payroll, as measured by total dollar value, is attributable
to employment located within this State, the taxpayer shall be entitled to a
maximum allowable deduction not to exceed the greater of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i) $10,000,000; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><sup><span style='font-family:

aggregate adjusted basis of qualified small business stock issued by the
corporation and disposed of by the taxpayer during the taxable year; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  If less than 80 percent
of the corporations payroll, as measured by total dollar value, is
attributable to employment located within this State, the taxpayer shall be
entitled to a maximum allowable deduction not to exceed the greater of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    $8,000,000; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   eight times the
aggregate adjusted basis of qualified small business stock issued by the
corporation and disposed of by the taxpayer in the taxable year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Notwithstanding any
provision of this paragraph to the contrary, the maximum allowable deduction
amounts set forth in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be
reduced by the aggregate amount of eligible gain taken into account by the
taxpayer under this section for any prior taxable year attributable to
dispositions of stock issued by the corporation.  The applicable aggregate
adjusted basis of qualified small business stock shall be determined without
regard to any addition to basis after the date on which the stock was
originally issued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   For purposes of this
subsection, the term eligible gain means any gain from the sale or exchange
of qualified small business stock held for more than five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   (a)  In the case of a
married individual filing a separate return, the maximum deduction allowed
pursuant to this subsection shall be the greater of: 50 percent of the dollar
value allowed; or 50 percent of the aggregate adjusted basis allowed, pursuant
to this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   In the case of a married
taxpayer filing a joint return, the amount of gain taken into account under this
subsection shall be allocated equally between the spouses for purposes of
applying this subsection to subsequent taxable years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Qualified small
business stock means any stock in a C corporation which is originally issued on
or after January 1, 2015, if both of the following apply:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   As of the date of
issuance, the corporation is a qualified small business.</p>
