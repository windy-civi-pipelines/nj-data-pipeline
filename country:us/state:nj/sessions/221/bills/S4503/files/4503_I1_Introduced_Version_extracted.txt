(2)   If the adjusted basis of any qualified small business stock is adjusted by reason of any contribution to capital after the date on which the stock was originally issued, in determining the amount of the adjustment by reason of the contribution, the basis of the contributed property shall in no event be treated as less than its fair market value on the date of the contribution. i.     (1) If the taxpayer has an offsetting short position with respect to any qualified small business stock, subsection a. of this section shall not apply to any gain from the sale or exchange of the stock unless the stock was held by the taxpayer for more than five years as of the first day on which there was such a short position and the taxpayer elects to recognize gain as if the stock was sold on that first day for its fair market value. (2)   For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the taxpayer shall be treated as having an offsetting short position with respect to any qualified small business stock if any of the following apply: (a)   the taxpayer has made a short sale of substantially identical property; (b)   the taxpayer has acquired an option to sell substantially identical property at a fixed price; or (c)   to the extent provided in regulations, the taxpayer has entered into any other transaction that substantially reduces the risk of loss from holding the qualified small business stock. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any reference to the taxpayer shall be treated as including a reference to any person who is related, within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.267(b) or s.707(b)), to the taxpayer. j.     A corporation that issues qualified small business stock agrees to submit reports to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury and to its shareholders as the director may require to carry out the purposes of this section. 2.    The Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury shall prescribe regulations pursuant to the provision of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this act, including any regulations that may conform to those regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 1202(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.1202(k)) that shall apply to the extent that those regulations do not conflict with this act, and such further regulation that shall include but be not limited to regulations to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this act through splitups, shell corporations, partnerships, or otherwise. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to taxable years beginning on or after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill allows a taxpayer to claim a deduction from New Jersey gross income for the capital gains earned from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock (QSBS) held for more than five years.  The maximum deduction allowable under the bill depends on the percentage of the qualified small business payroll, as measured by total dollar value, which is attributable to employment located within the State. Specifically, if a taxpayer has capital gains for the taxable year from one or more dispositions of QSBS, the taxpayer would be allowed to claim a deduction, as follows: (1) if the percentage of the qualified small businesss payroll attributable to in-State employees is at least 80 percent, the maximum allowable deduction would be the greater of $10 million or 10 times the aggregate adjusted basis of the QSBS; and (2) if the percentage of the qualified small businesss payroll attributable to in-State employees is less than 80 percent, the maximum allowable deduction would be the greater of $8 million or 8 times the aggregate adjusted basis of the QSBS. However, these maximum allowable deduction amounts would be reduced by the aggregate amount of eligible gain claimed by the taxpayer for any prior taxable year and attributable to dispositions of stock issued by the corporation. The maximum deduction of $10 million or 10 times the aggregate adjusted basis of QSBS is modeled on the federal capital gains exclusion allowed under section 1202 of the federal Internal Revenue Code. Under the bill, a QSBS is generally defined to include any stock that is originally issued by a C corporation on or after January 1, 2015, provided the corporation qualifies as a qualified small business as of the date of issuance, and the stock was acquired by the taxpayer at its original issue, not a secondary market.  The bill also requires the QSBS to have been acquired in exchange for money or property, or as compensation for services provided to the corporation. For an individual taxpayer to qualify for the special capital gains treatment under the bill, the taxpayer is required to have held the QSBS for at least five years.  Specifically, the stock is required to be in a qualified small business that is a domestic C corporation, and remains a C corporation during substantially all of the time the individual holds the stock, and which meets all of the following criteria: (1) the aggregate gross assets of the corporation do not exceed $50 million, both at all times after the effective date of the bill and before the issuance of the stock; (2) the aggregate gross assets of the corporation do not exceed $50 million as of the date the stock was issued and immediately thereafter; and (3) the corporation has fewer than 225 employees. Additionally, during substantially all of the time the stock is held, at least 80 percent of the value of the corporations assets is required to be used in the active conduct of one or more qualified businesses.  As under section 1202 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, the bill provides that a gross income tax deduction may not be claimed for a capital gain realized from the sale or exchange of a QSBS in a business that is: a service business in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, or brokerage services; a banking, insurance, financing, leasing, investing, or similar business; a farming business; a business of operating a hotel, motel, restaurant, or similar business. If the individual taxpayer holds qualifying stock for at least five years, then the taxpayer would be able to exclude the capital gains made on the disposition of the stock, and thus pay no gross income on the capital gains.  The special exclusion of capital gains for qualified stock that is held by pass through entities, including a partnership, an S corporation, a regulated investment company, or a common trust fund, that otherwise meet the requirements of this bill, is available to the individual gross income taxpayers who hold interests in those pass-through entities.

STATEMENT This bill allows a taxpayer to claim a deduction from New Jersey gross income for the capital gains earned from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock (QSBS) held for more than five years.  The maximum deduction allowable under the bill depends on the percentage of the qualified small business payroll, as measured by total dollar value, which is attributable to employment located within the State. Specifically, if a taxpayer has capital gains for the taxable year from one or more dispositions of QSBS, the taxpayer would be allowed to claim a deduction, as follows: (1) if the percentage of the qualified small businesss payroll attributable to in-State employees is at least 80 percent, the maximum allowable deduction would be the greater of $10 million or 10 times the aggregate adjusted basis of the QSBS; and (2) if the percentage of the qualified small businesss payroll attributable to in-State employees is less than 80 percent, the maximum allowable deduction would be the greater of $8 million or 8 times the aggregate adjusted basis of the QSBS. However, these maximum allowable deduction amounts would be reduced by the aggregate amount of eligible gain claimed by the taxpayer for any prior taxable year and attributable to dispositions of stock issued by the corporation. The maximum deduction of $10 million or 10 times the aggregate adjusted basis of QSBS is modeled on the federal capital gains exclusion allowed under section 1202 of the federal Internal Revenue Code. Under the bill, a QSBS is generally defined to include any stock that is originally issued by a C corporation on or after January 1, 2015, provided the corporation qualifies as a qualified small business as of the date of issuance, and the stock was acquired by the taxpayer at its original issue, not a secondary market.  The bill also requires the QSBS to have been acquired in exchange for money or property, or as compensation for services provided to the corporation. For an individual taxpayer to qualify for the special capital gains treatment under the bill, the taxpayer is required to have held the QSBS for at least five years.  Specifically, the stock is required to be in a qualified small business that is a domestic C corporation, and remains a C corporation during substantially all of the time the individual holds the stock, and which meets all of the following criteria: (1) the aggregate gross assets of the corporation do not exceed $50 million, both at all times after the effective date of the bill and before the issuance of the stock; (2) the aggregate gross assets of the corporation do not exceed $50 million as of the date the stock was issued and immediately thereafter; and (3) the corporation has fewer than 225 employees. Additionally, during substantially all of the time the stock is held, at least 80 percent of the value of the corporations assets is required to be used in the active conduct of one or more qualified businesses.  As under section 1202 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, the bill provides that a gross income tax deduction may not be claimed for a capital gain realized from the sale or exchange of a QSBS in a business that is: a service business in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, or brokerage services; a banking, insurance, financing, leasing, investing, or similar business; a farming business; a business of operating a hotel, motel, restaurant, or similar business. If the individual taxpayer holds qualifying stock for at least five years, then the taxpayer would be able to exclude the capital gains made on the disposition of the stock, and thus pay no gross income on the capital gains.  The special exclusion of capital gains for qualified stock that is held by pass through entities, including a partnership, an S corporation, a regulated investment company, or a common trust fund, that otherwise meet the requirements of this bill, is available to the individual gross income taxpayers who hold interests in those pass-through entities.
