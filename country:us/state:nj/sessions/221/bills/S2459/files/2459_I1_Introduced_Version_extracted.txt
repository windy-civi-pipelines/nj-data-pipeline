The New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act establishes a prevailing wage level for workers engaged in public works in order to safeguard the workers efficiency and general well-being. The law intends to protect workers, as well as their employers, from the effects of serious and unfair competition resulting from wage levels that are detrimental to the efficiency and well-being of all concerned.  The law requires the provision of minimum rates of pay to laborers, craftsmen, and apprentices employed on public works projects.  Covered workers are required to receive the appropriate craft prevailing wage rate as determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development. Prevailing wage rates are based on the collective bargaining agreements established for a particular craft or trade in the locality in which the public work is performed.  In New Jersey, these rates vary by county and by the type of work performed.
