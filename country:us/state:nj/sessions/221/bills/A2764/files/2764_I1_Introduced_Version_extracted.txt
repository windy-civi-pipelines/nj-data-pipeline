When negotiations occur pursuant to subparagraph [f.] (f) of this [section] subsection, a written record of the nature and content of the negotiations, as well as the dates and persons involved, shall become a public record when the notice of intent to award the contract is issued. Any or all bids may be rejected when the State Treasurer or the Director of the Division of Purchase and Property determines that it is in the public interest so to do except that bids for construction projects shall be rejected pursuant to the provisions of section 15 of P.L.    , c.   (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The State Treasurer or designee may adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section. This section shall apply to all bids received on and after the date of enactment of P.L.1999, c.440. For purposes of this subsection: "Specified alternate proposal" means a requirement of the bid specification for bidders to submit prices for reduced, modified, or supplemental work in addition to the base proposal which may include, but not be limited to, a change in project scope or the use of alternative materials or methods of construction. b.    Whenever by law a State independent authority may negotiate with bidders, after bid opening, the final terms and conditions of any procurement, including price, and such ability to so negotiate is expressly set forth in the applicable invitation to bid, a written record of the nature and content of the negotiations, as well as the dates and persons involved, shall not be publicly accessible until after the notice of intent to award the contract is issued. (cf: P.L.2005, c.336, s.14) 15.  (New section)  Bids received for construction projects, the cost or contract price whereof is to be paid with or out of State funds, except as otherwise provided, may all be rejected only for any of the following publicly stated bona fide reasons: a.  The lowest bid substantially exceeds the published and attested cost estimates or estimate ranges for the goods or services; b.  The lowest bid substantially exceeds the appropriation, if any, for the goods or services; c.  A decision is made to abandon the construction project; and d.  The scope and specifications for the construction project are substantially revised. 16.  This act shall take effect immediately and apply to bids advertised on or after the first day of the eighth month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill, designated as the Fairness in Bidding Act, would amend advertising and notice provisions of the "Local Public Contracts Law," P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.); the "State College Contracts Law," P.L.1986, c.43 (C.18A:64-52 et seq.); the "County College Contracts Law," P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.1 et seq.); the Public School Contracts Law, N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq.; P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-235 et al.); and P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-6 et seq.).  This bill would require contracting units requesting bids for construction projects projected to cost in excess of $500,000 to advertise their projected cost estimate ranges of the contract and any alternate.  The highest amount of a cost estimate range would be limited at no greater than five percent more than the lowest amount.  The cost estimate ranges would be required to be attested as reasonable by the individual or firm preparing them. The bill would also revise the laws authorizing the contracting units to reject, for any of various statutorily specified reasons, all construction project bids.  These revisions would (1) limit the grounds for such rejection to those currently specified, (2) require any such rejection to be done in good faith, and (3) require a unit to state publicly its grounds for such a rejection. The bill would also permit contracting units to require a bidder to provide a guaranty in the amount of 50 percent of the bid but not in excess of $100,000, payable to the contracting unit, to ensure that if the contract is awarded to the bidder, the bidder will enter into a contract.  Currently, contracting units are only permitted to require a guaranty of 10 percent of the bid but not in excess of $20,000. Finally, the bill provides that only one copy of all bid documents shall be required when bids are accepted by mail or hand delivery. This bill would help ensure greater openness in the bidding process and further ensure careful deliberation before a decision is reached to reject all bids.

(cf: P.L.2007, c.4, s.1) 13.  Section 9 of P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-243) is amended to read as follows. 9.  a.  In undertaking any school facilities projects where the cost of construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement will exceed $25,000, the development authority may prepare, or cause to be prepared, separate plans and specifications for: (1) the plumbing and gas fitting and all work and materials kindred thereto, (2) the steam and hot water heating and ventilating apparatus, steam power plants and all work and materials kindred thereto, (3) the electrical work, (4) structural steel and miscellaneous iron work and materials, and (5) all general construction, which shall include all other work and materials required to complete the building. Commencing in the fifth year after the year in which P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-235 et al.) takes effect, and every five years thereafter, the Governor, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, shall adjust the amount set forth in this subsection or the amount resulting from any adjustment under this subsection in direct proportion to the rise or fall of the index rate as defined in this subsection, and shall round the adjustment to the nearest $1,000.  The Governor shall, no later than June 1 of every fifth year, notify the development authority of the adjustment.  The adjustment shall become effective on July 1 of the year in which it is made.

The rules and regulations promulgated by the New Jersey Schools Construction Corporation pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.) shall remain in full force and effect unless subsequently revised by the development authority following the enactment of P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-235 et al.). g.    Each evaluation committee selected by the development authority to review and evaluate bids shall, at a minimum, contain a representative from the district in which the school facilities project is located if the district elects to participate. h.    All advertisements for bids shall be published in a legal newspaper and be posted on the development authority's website sufficiently in advance of the date fixed for receiving the bids to promote competitive bidding but in no event less than 10 days prior to such date.  The advertisement for bids for construction projects projected to cost in excess of $500,000 shall include the development authority's projected cost estimate ranges for the base bid contract and any specified alternate proposal, such estimate ranges having been attested to as reasonable by the individual or firm preparing the cost estimate ranges.  The highest amount of a cost estimate range shall not be greater than five percent more than the lowest amount.  The projected cost estimate ranges shall be attested no more than 30 days prior to the bid advertisement date.  Notice of revisions or addenda to advertisements or bid documents relating to bids shall be advertised on the development authority's website to best give notice to bidders no later than seven days, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted, prior to the bid due date.  The notice shall be provided to any person who has submitted a bid, in one of the following ways: (a) in writing by certified mail or (b) by certified facsimile transmission, meaning that the sender's facsimile machine produces a receipt showing date and time of transmission and that the transmission was successful or (c) by a delivery service that provides certification of delivery to the sender. Failure to advertise or provide proper notification of revisions or addenda to advertisements or bid documents related to bids as prescribed by this section shall prevent the acceptance of bids and require the readvertisement for bids.  Failure to obtain a receipt when good faith notice is sent or delivered to the address or telephone facsimile number on file with the development authority shall not be considered failure by the development authority to provide notice. For purposes of this subsection: "Specified alternate proposal" means a requirement of the bid specification for bidders to submit prices for reduced, modified, or supplemental work in addition to the base proposal which may include, but not be limited to, a change in project scope or the use of alternative materials or methods of construction. i.     Any purchase, contract, or agreement may be made, negotiated, or awarded by the development authority without public bid or advertising when the public exigency so requires. j.     Any purchase, contract, or agreement may be made, negotiated, or awarded by the development authority without public bid or advertising when the authority has advertised for bids on two occasions and has received no bids on both occasions in response to its advertisements.  Any purchase, contract, or agreement may be negotiated by the development authority after public bid or advertising when the authority receives only a single responsive bid, provided however that negotiation with that single responsive bidder shall be limited to price. k.    The development authority may reject all bids for a construction project only for any of the following publicly stated bona fide reasons: (1) The lowest bid substantially exceeds the published and attested cost estimates or estimate ranges for the construction project; (2) The lowest bid substantially exceeds the appropriation, if any, for the construction project; (3) The development authority decides to abandon the construction project; and (4)  The development authority wants to substantially revise the scope and specifications for the construction project. (cf:  P.L.2007, c.137, s.9) 14.  Section 7 of P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-12) is amended to read as follows: 7.  a.  Whenever advertising is required:  (a) specifications and invitations for bids shall permit such full and free competition as is consistent with the procurement of supplies and services necessary to meet the requirements of the using agency and shall, wherever practicable, include such factors as life-cycle costs, sliding percentage preference scales, or other similar analysis as shall be deemed effective by the Director of the Division of Purchase and Property, hereinafter referred to as the director, (b) the advertisement for bids shall be in such newspaper or newspapers and other medium or media selected by the State Treasurer as will best give notice thereof to bidders and shall be sufficiently in advance of the purchase or contract to promote competitive bidding; (c) the advertisement shall designate the time and secure location when and where proposals, which may be submitted in electronic or other format designated by the director, shall be received, opened and publicly announced, the amount of the cash or certified check, if any, which must accompany each bid, and such other terms as the State Treasurer may deem proper; (d) notice of revisions or addenda to advertisements or bid documents relating to bids shall be published in a newspaper or newspapers and other medium or media selected by the State Treasurer to give notice to bidders at least seven days, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted, prior to the bid due date; (e) failure to advertise for the receipt of bids or to provide proper notification of revisions or addenda to advertisements or bid documents related to bids as prescribed by subsection (d) of this section shall prevent the acceptance of bids and require the readvertisement for bids; (f) for any procurement, the State Treasurer or the director may negotiate with bidders the final terms and conditions of any procurement, including price; such ability to so negotiate must be expressly set forth in the applicable invitation to bid and such bids shall not be publicly accessible until after negotiations have been completed and the notice of intent to award the contract has been issued; (g) award shall be made with reasonable promptness, after negotiation with bidders where authorized, by written or electronic notice to that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the State, price and other factors considered; [and] (h) the Treasurer shall require, with respect to contracts for information technology goods and services, a limitation of liability determined by the Director of the Division of Purchase and Property; and (i) the advertisement for bids for construction projects projected to cost in excess of $500,000 shall include the projected cost estimate ranges for the base bid contract and any specified alternate proposal, such estimate ranges having been attested to as reasonable by the individual or firm preparing the estimate ranges; the highest amount of such cost estimate range shall not be greater than five percent more than the lowest amount; such projected cost estimate ranges shall be attested no more than 30 days prior to the bid advertisement date. When negotiations occur pursuant to subparagraph [f.] (f) of this [section] subsection, a written record of the nature and content of the negotiations, as well as the dates and persons involved, shall become a public record when the notice of intent to award the contract is issued. Any or all bids may be rejected when the State Treasurer or the Director of the Division of Purchase and Property determines that it is in the public interest so to do except that bids for construction projects shall be rejected pursuant to the provisions of section 15 of P.L.    , c.   (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The State Treasurer or designee may adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section. This section shall apply to all bids received on and after the date of enactment of P.L.1999, c.440. For purposes of this subsection: "Specified alternate proposal" means a requirement of the bid specification for bidders to submit prices for reduced, modified, or supplemental work in addition to the base proposal which may include, but not be limited to, a change in project scope or the use of alternative materials or methods of construction. b.    Whenever by law a State independent authority may negotiate with bidders, after bid opening, the final terms and conditions of any procurement, including price, and such ability to so negotiate is expressly set forth in the applicable invitation to bid, a written record of the nature and content of the negotiations, as well as the dates and persons involved, shall not be publicly accessible until after the notice of intent to award the contract is issued. (cf: P.L.2005, c.336, s.14) 15.  (New section)  Bids received for construction projects, the cost or contract price whereof is to be paid with or out of State funds, except as otherwise provided, may all be rejected only for any of the following publicly stated bona fide reasons: a.  The lowest bid substantially exceeds the published and attested cost estimates or estimate ranges for the goods or services; b.  The lowest bid substantially exceeds the appropriation, if any, for the goods or services; c.  A decision is made to abandon the construction project; and d.  The scope and specifications for the construction project are substantially revised. 16.  This act shall take effect immediately and apply to bids advertised on or after the first day of the eighth month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill, designated as the Fairness in Bidding Act, would amend advertising and notice provisions of the "Local Public Contracts Law," P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.); the "State College Contracts Law," P.L.1986, c.43 (C.18A:64-52 et seq.); the "County College Contracts Law," P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.1 et seq.); the Public School Contracts Law, N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq.; P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-235 et al.); and P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-6 et seq.).  This bill would require contracting units requesting bids for construction projects projected to cost in excess of $500,000 to advertise their projected cost estimate ranges of the contract and any alternate.  The highest amount of a cost estimate range would be limited at no greater than five percent more than the lowest amount.  The cost estimate ranges would be required to be attested as reasonable by the individual or firm preparing them. The bill would also revise the laws authorizing the contracting units to reject, for any of various statutorily specified reasons, all construction project bids.  These revisions would (1) limit the grounds for such rejection to those currently specified, (2) require any such rejection to be done in good faith, and (3) require a unit to state publicly its grounds for such a rejection. The bill would also permit contracting units to require a bidder to provide a guaranty in the amount of 50 percent of the bid but not in excess of $100,000, payable to the contracting unit, to ensure that if the contract is awarded to the bidder, the bidder will enter into a contract.  Currently, contracting units are only permitted to require a guaranty of 10 percent of the bid but not in excess of $20,000. Finally, the bill provides that only one copy of all bid documents shall be required when bids are accepted by mail or hand delivery. This bill would help ensure greater openness in the bidding process and further ensure careful deliberation before a decision is reached to reject all bids.
