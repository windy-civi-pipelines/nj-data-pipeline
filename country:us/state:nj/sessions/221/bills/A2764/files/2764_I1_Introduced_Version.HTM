ranges having been attested to as reasonable by the individual or firm
preparing the cost estimate ranges.  The highest amount of a cost estimate

bids and thereupon immediately proceed to unseal them and publicly announce the
contents, which announcement shall be made in the presence of any parties
bidding or their agents who are then and there present.  A proper record of the

the &quot;State College Contracts Law,&quot; P.L.1986, c.43 (C.18A:64-52 et

seq.; P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-235 et al.); and P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-6 et
seq.).  This bill would require contracting units requesting bids for
construction projects projected to cost in excess of $500,000 to advertise
their projected cost estimate ranges of the contract and any alternate.  The
highest amount of a cost estimate range would be limited at no greater than
five percent more than the lowest amount.  The cost estimate ranges would be
required to be attested as reasonable by the individual or firm preparing them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also revise the
laws authorizing the contracting units to reject, for any of various
statutorily specified reasons, all construction project bids.  These revisions
would (1) limit the grounds for such rejection to those currently specified,
(2) require any such rejection to be done in good faith, and (3) require a unit
to state publicly its grounds for such a rejection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also permit
contracting units to require a bidder to provide a guaranty in the amount of 50
percent of the bid but not in excess of $100,000, payable to the contracting
unit, to ensure that if the contract is awarded to the bidder, the bidder will
enter into a contract.  Currently, contracting units are only permitted to
require a guaranty of 10 percent of the bid but not in excess of $20,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that only one copy of all bid documents shall be required when bids are
accepted by mail or hand delivery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would help ensure
greater openness in the bidding process and further ensure careful deliberation
before a decision is reached to reject all bids. </p>
