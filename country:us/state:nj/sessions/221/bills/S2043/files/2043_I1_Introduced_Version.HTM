The bill directs the department to annually collect data on the number of students that were removed from school for a mental health clearance, the duration of the students removals, the number of students who were returned to school with a mental health clearance, and the number of students who were not cleared for return to school.  The department is required to publish the data on its website in a manner that protects student privacy.  The data is to be disaggregated by general education students and students with disabilities, by county, and by race, gender, and age of the student.
