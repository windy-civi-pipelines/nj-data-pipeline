concerning the approval of certain large warehouse development projects and

P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.); and supplementing chapter 4 of Title 54
of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:
150%'> </span><i>by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  <span
style='color:black'>The Legislature finds and declares that:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     a.     </span>The
development of new types of large warehouses within a host municipality often
result in land use, traffic, environmental, economic, fiscal, and social equity
effects beyond the boundaries of the host municipality, and may adversely
impact the overall region in which the large warehouse is being proposed for
development; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    It is important for a
host municipality to have an updated master plan before the approval of a large
warehouse in order for a host municipality to identify suitable areas within the
municipality for commercial and economic development that does not conflict
with the municipalitys need to protect farming areas, open space, recreation
areas, and areas of historic and cultural significance;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Additionally, it is
critical for a municipality that has approved the development of a large
warehouse to re-assess all real property in the municipality thereby helping to
equalize the revenue requirements within the municipality; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Therefore, in the
interest of Statewide public health, safety, and welfare, it is essential to
require each municipality to withhold individual land use approvals of large
warehouses until the potential effects of the development of a large warehouse
on the host municipality, certain adjoining municipalities, and on the entire
region is assessed and approved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 3 of P.L.1975,
