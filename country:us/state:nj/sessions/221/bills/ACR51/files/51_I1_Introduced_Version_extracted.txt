As under present law, justices would be retired at 70 years of age. SCHEDULE This constitutional amendment shall, if approved, take effect on January 1, next following the general election at which it was approved and shall be applicable to Supreme Court justices whose initial term expires on or after that date. STATEMENT Presently, Supreme Court justices serve an initial seven-year term and receive tenure upon reappointment by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.  This concurrent resolution proposes a constitutional amendment that would provide for 5 year terms for Justices of the Supreme Court.  There would be no limitation on the number of terms which a Justice may serve, but no Justice would receive tenure unless and until that Justice is reappointed and is approved for tenure by the voters in a tenure election.  If a Justice is not approved by the voters for tenure, he would remain eligible for reappointment to another 5 year term, at the discretion of the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate.  As under present law, justices would be retired at 70 years of age.
