c.303 (C.34:13A-5.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    There is hereby
established a Division of Public Employment Relations and a Division of Private
Employment Dispute Settlement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The Division of Public
Employment Relations shall be concerned exclusively with matters of public
employment related to determining negotiating units, elections, certifications
and settlement of public employee representative and public employer disputes
and grievance procedures.  For the purpose of complying with the provisions of
Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, the Division
of Public Employment Relations is hereby allocated within the Department of
Labor and Workforce Development, and located in the city of Trenton, but
notwithstanding said allocation, the office shall be independent of any
supervision or control by the department or by any board or officer thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The Division of Private
Employment Dispute Settlement shall assist the New Jersey State Board of
Mediation in the resolution of disputes in private employment.  The New Jersey
State Board of Mediation, its objectives and the powers and duties granted by
this act and the act of which this act is amendatory and supplementary shall be
concerned exclusively with matters of private employment and the office shall
continue to be located in the city of Newark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   In the case of a private
employer <u>that has any employees not subject to the provisions of the National
Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. s.151 et seq.), or is</u> not regulated by the
National Labor Relations Board pursuant to <span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span>the

employees of the private employer<u>, or any employees of the employer if the
employer is not regulated by that act,</u> for the purposes of collective
bargaining when:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   In any case in which the
board determines that <u>there is no current majority representative and</u>
only one employee organization is seeking to be the majority representative,
that organization demonstrates that a majority of employees in the unit have
shown their preference to have that organization be their representative by
signing authorization cards indicating that preference; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The employees in the

(1) of this subsection, an authorization card indicating preference shall not
be valid unless it is printed in a language understood by the employee who
signs it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>An employee organization
seeking to be recognized as a majority representative, either by a card
authorization procedure pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or by an
election pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, is permitted, but not
required, to petition the New Jersey State Board of Mediation to require the
employer to file, within not more than 48 hours, and in the manner required by
the board, a complete and accurate list of the full names, current street
addresses, and job classifications of the current employees, and phone numbers
or other employee contact information available to the employer, which the
board shall immediately convey to the employee organization.</u>  Any employer
who refuses to provide information requested by the New Jersey State Board of
Mediation or otherwise acts to prevent the board from carrying out its
responsibilities pursuant to this subsection (c) shall have violated this
subsection and shall be liable to a fine of not more than <b><span

(C.2A:58-10 et seq.) in the name of the board and to be used by the board for
costs of implementing this subsection.  In addition, an employee organization
seeking to represent the employees of the employer may institute an action in a
court of competent jurisdiction to obtain an injunction to restrain any
continuation of the violation, to reimburse the employee organization or any
affected employee for any damages caused by the violation plus reasonable costs
and attorney's fees of the action.</p>

subsection (c) shall not apply to religious or parochial schools or their

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides cannabis
workers employed by cannabis employers rights and protections equal to the
rights and protections provided to other workers with respect to employee
representation, collective bargaining, and unfair labor practices.  Cannabis
employers are defined in the bill as employers who are licensed or regulated
under chapter 6I of Title 24 of the Revised Statutes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, certain cannabis
workers, most notably those employed by licensed cannabis cultivators, are
excluded from protections against unfair labor practices provided to most
private sector workers by the federal National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C.
s.151 et seq.)(NLRA), and provided to public employees by the State public employment
relations law, P.L.1968, c.303 (C.34:13A-5.1 et seq.)(PERL) and the Workplace
Democracy Enhancement Act, P.L.2018, c.15 (C.34:13A-5.11 et seq.) (WDEA).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill brings those cannabis
workers under protections similar to those laws, by expanding the
responsibilities of the State Board of Mediation in the Department of Labor and
Workforce Development regarding cannabis employment not regulated by the NLRA. 
It provides the board with the power to prevent specified unfair labor
practices, thus providing rights to the cannabis workers similar to the rights
provided to other private sector workers by the NLRA, and the rights provided
to public employees by the PERL and the WDEA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits cannabis
employers and their representatives and agents from the following unfair
practices:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Interfering with,
restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of the rights granted by the
bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Dominating or
interfering with any employee organization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Discriminating against
employees for making disclosures or otherwise exercising their rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    Refusing to negotiate in
good faith or sign a negotiated agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    Violating any board regulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill similarly prohibits cannabis
worker organizations and their representatives and agents from the following
unfair practices:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Interfering with,
restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Interfering with,
restraining, or coercing a cannabis employer in the selection of a
representative for negotiations or grievance procedures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Refusing to negotiate in
good faith or sign a negotiated agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    Violating any board regulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The board may order an
offending party to cease any unfair practice and take reasonable remedial
action, including, in the case of a discharge, reinstatement, paying lost
wages, costs of action, and damages equal to the wages due.  It is also an
unfair practice under the bill for a cannabis employer to encourage or discourage
employees from joining, forming or assisting an employee organization, or
encourage them to end their employee organization membership or revoke
authorization of the deduction of dues or fees.  The board is required to order
the employer to make whole the employee organization for any resulting losses
to the organization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law, section 5 of
P.L.1968, c.303 (C.34:13A-5.1), directs the New Jersey State Board of Mediation
to designate a labor organization to represent employees of any private sector
employer not regulated under the NLRA, including an employer who is not a
cannabis employer, if the employees select the organization in an election
conforming with NLRA procedures, or, if only one labor organization seeks to
represent the employees, a majority of the employees sign cards showing that
they prefer that organization.  The bill provides that in such cases, including
cases of non-cannabis employers, the employee organization may petition the
board to require the employer to provide a list of current employees with
contact information.  The bill increases penalties for employer non-compliance
from not more than $1,000 to not more than $5,000 per day of non-compliance. 
Finally, the bill clarifies that the provisions of section 5 of P.L.1968, c.303
(C.34:13A-5.1) concerning private employers not subject to the NLRA apply to
employees not subject to the NLRA even if employed by an employer who has both
employees not subject to the NLRA and employees who are subject to the NRLA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides, with
respect to cannabis workers and employers, that if the employee organization
petitions the board for that information, then the employer must also give the
organization access to the employees, including allowing meetings in the
workplace and employer-controlled living quarters.  The bill provides that once
the organization is designated as the employee representative, the employer
must give the organization access to the employers premises to investigate and
discuss grievances and other issues, conduct meetings, and meet newly hired
employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill gives cannabis worker
organizations the right to engage in publicity regarding products produced by
an employer with which the organization has a dispute, including publicity
asking the public to not patronize businesses distributing or selling the
products.</p>
