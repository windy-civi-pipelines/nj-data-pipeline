(a)   The Division of Public Employment Relations shall be concerned exclusively with matters of public employment related to determining negotiating units, elections, certifications and settlement of public employee representative and public employer disputes and grievance procedures.  For the purpose of complying with the provisions of Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, the Division of Public Employment Relations is hereby allocated within the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and located in the city of Trenton, but notwithstanding said allocation, the office shall be independent of any supervision or control by the department or by any board or officer thereof. (b)   The Division of Private Employment Dispute Settlement shall assist the New Jersey State Board of Mediation in the resolution of disputes in private employment.  The New Jersey State Board of Mediation, its objectives and the powers and duties granted by this act and the act of which this act is amendatory and supplementary shall be concerned exclusively with matters of private employment and the office shall continue to be located in the city of Newark. (c)   In the case of a private employer that has any employees not subject to the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. s.151 et seq.), or is not regulated by the National Labor Relations Board pursuant to [the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. s.151 et seq.)] that act, the New Jersey State Board of Mediation shall designate a representative for a unit of those employees of the private employer, or any employees of the employer if the employer is not regulated by that act, for the purposes of collective bargaining when: (1)   In any case in which the board determines that there is no current majority representative and only one employee organization is seeking to be the majority representative, that organization demonstrates that a majority of employees in the unit have shown their preference to have that organization be their representative by signing authorization cards indicating that preference; or (2)   The employees in the unit have selected a representative by an election that conforms with the procedures outlined in section 159 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. s.159). For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, an authorization card indicating preference shall not be valid unless it is printed in a language understood by the employee who signs it. An employee organization seeking to be recognized as a majority representative, either by a card authorization procedure pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or by an election pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, is permitted, but not required, to petition the New Jersey State Board of Mediation to require the employer to file, within not more than 48 hours, and in the manner required by the board, a complete and accurate list of the full names, current street addresses, and job classifications of the current employees, and phone numbers or other employee contact information available to the employer, which the board shall immediately convey to the employee organization.  Any employer who refuses to provide information requested by the New Jersey State Board of Mediation or otherwise acts to prevent the board from carrying out its responsibilities pursuant to this subsection (c) shall have violated this subsection and shall be liable to a fine of not more than [$1,000] $5,000 for each day that the employer fails to provide a complete response or otherwise prevents the board from carrying out its responsibilities, to be recovered under the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.) in the name of the board and to be used by the board for costs of implementing this subsection.  In addition, an employee organization seeking to represent the employees of the employer may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain an injunction to restrain any continuation of the violation, to reimburse the employee organization or any affected employee for any damages caused by the violation plus reasonable costs and attorney's fees of the action. The provisions of this subsection (c) shall not apply to religious or parochial schools or their employees or to any private nonprofit organization exempt from federal taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s. 501). (d)   In the case of a private employer regulated by the National Labor Relations Board pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. s. 151 et seq.), the New Jersey State Board of Mediation shall, based on the mutual agreement of the private employer and an organization seeking to represent employees of the employer, designate a representative for a unit of employees of the private employer for the purposes of collective bargaining when: (1)   In any case in which the board determines that only one employee organization is seeking to be the majority representative, that organization demonstrates, in a manner mutually agreed upon by the representative and the employer, that a majority of employees in the unit have shown their preference to have that organization be their representative by signing authorization cards indicating that preference; or (2)   the employees in the unit have selected the representative by an election that conforms with the procedures outlined in section 159 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. s.159). (e)   For the purposes of subsections (c) and (d) of this section, "employee unit" means an appropriate group of employees for the purposes of collective bargaining as determined, if necessary, by the New Jersey State Board of Mediation.

(2)   to conduct worksite meetings during non-work breaks, and before and after the workday, to discuss workplace issues, collective negotiations, the administration of collective negotiations agreements, other matters related to the governance, business, and duties of the employee organization;

STATEMENT This bill provides cannabis workers employed by cannabis employers rights and protections equal to the rights and protections provided to other workers with respect to employee representation, collective bargaining, and unfair labor practices.  Cannabis employers are defined in the bill as employers who are licensed or regulated under chapter 6I of Title 24 of the Revised Statutes. Currently, certain cannabis workers, most notably those employed by licensed cannabis cultivators, are excluded from protections against unfair labor practices provided to most private sector workers by the federal National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. s.151 et seq.)(NLRA), and provided to public employees by the State public employment relations law, P.L.1968, c.303 (C.34:13A-5.1 et seq.)(PERL) and the Workplace Democracy Enhancement Act, P.L.2018, c.15 (C.34:13A-5.11 et seq.) (WDEA). This bill brings those cannabis workers under protections similar to those laws, by expanding the responsibilities of the State Board of Mediation in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development regarding cannabis employment not regulated by the NLRA. It provides the board with the power to prevent specified unfair labor practices, thus providing rights to the cannabis workers similar to the rights provided to other private sector workers by the NLRA, and the rights provided to public employees by the PERL and the WDEA. The bill prohibits cannabis employers and their representatives and agents from the following unfair practices: 1.    Interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of the rights granted by the bill. 2.    Dominating or interfering with any employee organization. 3.    Discriminating against employees for making disclosures or otherwise exercising their rights. 4.    Refusing to negotiate in good faith or sign a negotiated agreement. 5.    Violating any board regulation. The bill similarly prohibits cannabis worker organizations and their representatives and agents from the following unfair practices: 1.    Interfering with, restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights. 2.    Interfering with, restraining, or coercing a cannabis employer in the selection of a representative for negotiations or grievance procedures. 3.    Refusing to negotiate in good faith or sign a negotiated agreement. 4.    Violating any board regulation. The board may order an offending party to cease any unfair practice and take reasonable remedial action, including, in the case of a discharge, reinstatement, paying lost wages, costs of action, and damages equal to the wages due.  It is also an unfair practice under the bill for a cannabis employer to encourage or discourage employees from joining, forming or assisting an employee organization, or encourage them to end their employee organization membership or revoke authorization of the deduction of dues or fees.  The board is required to order the employer to make whole the employee organization for any resulting losses to the organization. Current law, section 5 of P.L.1968, c.303 (C.34:13A-5.1), directs the New Jersey State Board of Mediation to designate a labor organization to represent employees of any private sector employer not regulated under the NLRA, including an employer who is not a cannabis employer, if the employees select the organization in an election conforming with NLRA procedures, or, if only one labor organization seeks to represent the employees, a majority of the employees sign cards showing that they prefer that organization.  The bill provides that in such cases, including cases of non-cannabis employers, the employee organization may petition the board to require the employer to provide a list of current employees with contact information.  The bill increases penalties for employer non-compliance from not more than $1,000 to not more than $5,000 per day of non-compliance. Finally, the bill clarifies that the provisions of section 5 of P.L.1968, c.303 (C.34:13A-5.1) concerning private employers not subject to the NLRA apply to employees not subject to the NLRA even if employed by an employer who has both employees not subject to the NLRA and employees who are subject to the NRLA. The bill provides, with respect to cannabis workers and employers, that if the employee organization petitions the board for that information, then the employer must also give the organization access to the employees, including allowing meetings in the workplace and employer-controlled living quarters.  The bill provides that once the organization is designated as the employee representative, the employer must give the organization access to the employers premises to investigate and discuss grievances and other issues, conduct meetings, and meet newly hired employees. The bill gives cannabis worker organizations the right to engage in publicity regarding products produced by an employer with which the organization has a dispute, including publicity asking the public to not patronize businesses distributing or selling the products.

STATEMENT This bill provides cannabis workers employed by cannabis employers rights and protections equal to the rights and protections provided to other workers with respect to employee representation, collective bargaining, and unfair labor practices.  Cannabis employers are defined in the bill as employers who are licensed or regulated under chapter 6I of Title 24 of the Revised Statutes. Currently, certain cannabis workers, most notably those employed by licensed cannabis cultivators, are excluded from protections against unfair labor practices provided to most private sector workers by the federal National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. s.151 et seq.)(NLRA), and provided to public employees by the State public employment relations law, P.L.1968, c.303 (C.34:13A-5.1 et seq.)(PERL) and the Workplace Democracy Enhancement Act, P.L.2018, c.15 (C.34:13A-5.11 et seq.) (WDEA). This bill brings those cannabis workers under protections similar to those laws, by expanding the responsibilities of the State Board of Mediation in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development regarding cannabis employment not regulated by the NLRA. It provides the board with the power to prevent specified unfair labor practices, thus providing rights to the cannabis workers similar to the rights provided to other private sector workers by the NLRA, and the rights provided to public employees by the PERL and the WDEA. The bill prohibits cannabis employers and their representatives and agents from the following unfair practices: 1.    Interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of the rights granted by the bill. 2.    Dominating or interfering with any employee organization. 3.    Discriminating against employees for making disclosures or otherwise exercising their rights. 4.    Refusing to negotiate in good faith or sign a negotiated agreement. 5.    Violating any board regulation. The bill similarly prohibits cannabis worker organizations and their representatives and agents from the following unfair practices: 1.    Interfering with, restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights. 2.    Interfering with, restraining, or coercing a cannabis employer in the selection of a representative for negotiations or grievance procedures. 3.    Refusing to negotiate in good faith or sign a negotiated agreement. 4.    Violating any board regulation. The board may order an offending party to cease any unfair practice and take reasonable remedial action, including, in the case of a discharge, reinstatement, paying lost wages, costs of action, and damages equal to the wages due.  It is also an unfair practice under the bill for a cannabis employer to encourage or discourage employees from joining, forming or assisting an employee organization, or encourage them to end their employee organization membership or revoke authorization of the deduction of dues or fees.  The board is required to order the employer to make whole the employee organization for any resulting losses to the organization. Current law, section 5 of P.L.1968, c.303 (C.34:13A-5.1), directs the New Jersey State Board of Mediation to designate a labor organization to represent employees of any private sector employer not regulated under the NLRA, including an employer who is not a cannabis employer, if the employees select the organization in an election conforming with NLRA procedures, or, if only one labor organization seeks to represent the employees, a majority of the employees sign cards showing that they prefer that organization.  The bill provides that in such cases, including cases of non-cannabis employers, the employee organization may petition the board to require the employer to provide a list of current employees with contact information.  The bill increases penalties for employer non-compliance from not more than $1,000 to not more than $5,000 per day of non-compliance. Finally, the bill clarifies that the provisions of section 5 of P.L.1968, c.303 (C.34:13A-5.1) concerning private employers not subject to the NLRA apply to employees not subject to the NLRA even if employed by an employer who has both employees not subject to the NLRA and employees who are subject to the NRLA. The bill provides, with respect to cannabis workers and employers, that if the employee organization petitions the board for that information, then the employer must also give the organization access to the employees, including allowing meetings in the workplace and employer-controlled living quarters.  The bill provides that once the organization is designated as the employee representative, the employer must give the organization access to the employers premises to investigate and discuss grievances and other issues, conduct meetings, and meet newly hired employees. The bill gives cannabis worker organizations the right to engage in publicity regarding products produced by an employer with which the organization has a dispute, including publicity asking the public to not patronize businesses distributing or selling the products.
