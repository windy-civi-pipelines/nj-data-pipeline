A2123 ASSEMBLY, No. 2123 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  WILLIAM F. MOEN, JR. District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) Assemblyman  WILLIAM W. SPEARMAN District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) SYNOPSIS Requires certain solid waste incinerator facilities to install baghouse filters when making certain modifications to facility. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning air pollution from solid waste incinerators and supplementing P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  A solid waste incinerator that is a major facility, and that undertakes a modification or expansion, shall install a baghouse filter on the equipment of each incinerator at the facility.  The department shall condition the issuance to the facility of a permit pursuant to P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.) on the installation of a baghouse filter, which is of sufficient size and quality to effectively filter the emissions from the incinerator equipment at the facility. b.    The provisions of this section shall not apply to a solid waste incinerator that has a baghouse filter, or a more effective filtering system as determined by the department, installed on the equipment of each incinerator at the facility on the effective date of this act. c.     As used in this section, "expansion" means an increase in the area of the footprint of a facility, the construction of a new building in the facility, or an increase in the amount of solid waste annually combusted by the facility that is greater than 10 percent of the average amount of solid waste combusted by the facility during the preceding 5 years. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would supplement the "Air Pollution Control Act (1954)," P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.) (APCA), to require certain solid waste incinerators to install baghouse filters whenever the facility undertakes a modification or expansion.  A baghouse filter uses long cylindrical pieces of fabric to filter particulates from exhaust gases.  They are commonly used in various industrial applications such as power plants and steel mills. The bill would apply only to solid waste incinerators that are considered "major facilities" under the APCA, due to the quantity of certain air pollutants that they emit on an annual basis, and that do not currently utilize baghouse filters or better filtering systems. As defined in the APCA, a "modification" means a physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, existing equipment or control apparatus that increases the amount of any air contaminant emitted by that equipment or control apparatus or that results in the emission of any air contaminant not previously emitted.  As defined by the bill, "expansion" means an increase in the area of the footprint of a facility, the construction of a new building in the facility, or an increase in the amount of solid waste annually combusted by the facility that is greater than 10 percent of the average amount of solid waste combusted by the facility during the preceding 5 years.
