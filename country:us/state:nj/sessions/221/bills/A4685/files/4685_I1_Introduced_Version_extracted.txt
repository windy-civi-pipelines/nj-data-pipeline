The peer-to-peer vehicle sharing program has the right to seek indemnity from the shared vehicle driver for any loss or damage to such equipment that occurs during the car sharing period. 13.  a.  At the time when a vehicle owner registers as a shared vehicle owner on a peer-to-peer car sharing program and prior to the time when the shared vehicle owner makes a shared vehicle available for car sharing on the peer-to-peer car sharing program, the peer-to-peer car sharing program shall: (1)  verify that the shared vehicle does not have any safety recalls on the vehicle for which the repairs have not been made; and (2)  notify the shared vehicle owner of the requirements under subsection b. of this section. b.    (1) If the shared vehicle owner has received an actual notice of a safety recall on the vehicle, a shared vehicle owner shall not make a vehicle available as a shared vehicle on a peer-to-peer car sharing program until the safety recall repair has been made.

The peer-to-peer car sharing program shall retain the records for a time period not less than the applicable personal injury statute of limitations. 7.    A peer-to-peer car sharing program and a shared vehicle owner shall be exempt from vicarious liability in accordance with 49 U.S.C. s.30106 and under any State law that imposes liability solely based on vehicle ownership. 8.    A motor vehicle insurer that defends or indemnifies a claim against a shared vehicle that is excluded under the terms of its policy shall have the right to seek recovery against the motor vehicle insurer of the peer-to-peer car sharing program if the claim is: a.    made against the shared vehicle owner or the shared vehicle driver for loss or injury that occurs during the car sharing period; and b.    excluded under the terms of its policy. 9.    a.  Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the contrary, a peer-to-peer car sharing program shall have an insurable interest in a shared vehicle during the car sharing period. b.    Nothing in this section creates liability on a peer-to-peer car sharing program to maintain the coverage mandated pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.    A peer-to-peer car sharing program may own and maintain as the named insured one or more policies of motor vehicle liability insurance that provides coverage for: (1)  liabilities assumed by the peer-to-peer car sharing program under a peer-to-peer car sharing program agreement; (2)  any liability of the shared vehicle owner; or (3)  damage or loss to the shared motor vehicle or any liability of the shared vehicle driver. 10.  Each peer-to-peer car sharing program agreement made in the State shall disclose to the shared vehicle owner and the shared vehicle driver: a.    any right of the peer-to-peer car sharing program to seek indemnification from the shared vehicle owner or the shared vehicle driver for economic loss sustained by the peer-to-peer car sharing program resulting from a breach of the terms and conditions of the peer-to-peer car sharing program agreement; b.    that a motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued to the shared vehicle owner for the shared vehicle or to the shared vehicle driver does not provide a defense or indemnification for any claim asserted by the peer-to-peer car sharing program; c.    that the peer-to-peer car sharing programs insurance coverage on the shared vehicle owner and the shared vehicle driver is in effect only during each car sharing period and that, for any use of the shared vehicle by the shared vehicle driver after the car sharing termination time, the shared vehicle driver and the shared vehicle owner shall not have insurance coverage; d.    the daily rate, fees, and if applicable, any insurance or protection package costs that are charged to the shared vehicle owner or the shared vehicle driver; e.    that the shared vehicle owners motor vehicle liability insurance may not provide coverage for a shared vehicle; f.     an emergency telephone number to personnel capable of fielding roadside assistance and other customer service inquiries; and g.    the conditions, if any, under which a shared vehicle driver shall maintain a personal automobile insurance policy with certain applicable coverage limits on a primary basis in order to book a shared motor vehicle. 11.  a.  A peer-to-peer car sharing program shall not enter into a peer-to-peer car sharing program agreement with a shared driver unless the individual who will operate the shared vehicle: (1)  holds a drivers license issued under the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission that authorizes the driver to operate vehicles of the class of the shared vehicle; (2)  is a nonresident who: (a)   has a drivers license issued by the state or country of the drivers residence that authorizes the driver in that state or country to drive vehicles of the class of the shared vehicle; and (b)  is at least the same age as that required of a resident of the State to drive; or (3)  otherwise is specifically authorized by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission to drive vehicles of the class of the shared vehicle. b.    A peer-to-peer car sharing program shall keep a record of: (1)  the name and address of the shared vehicle driver; (2)  the number of the drivers license of the shared vehicle driver and each other person, if any, who will operate the shared vehicle; and (3)  the place of issuance of the drivers license. 12.  A peer-to-peer car sharing program shall have sole responsibility for any equipment, such as a GPS system or other special equipment that is put in or on the vehicle to monitor or facilitate the car sharing transaction and shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the vehicle owner for any damage to or theft of such equipment during the car sharing period not caused by the shared vehicle owner. The peer-to-peer vehicle sharing program has the right to seek indemnity from the shared vehicle driver for any loss or damage to such equipment that occurs during the car sharing period. 13.  a.  At the time when a vehicle owner registers as a shared vehicle owner on a peer-to-peer car sharing program and prior to the time when the shared vehicle owner makes a shared vehicle available for car sharing on the peer-to-peer car sharing program, the peer-to-peer car sharing program shall: (1)  verify that the shared vehicle does not have any safety recalls on the vehicle for which the repairs have not been made; and (2)  notify the shared vehicle owner of the requirements under subsection b. of this section. b.    (1) If the shared vehicle owner has received an actual notice of a safety recall on the vehicle, a shared vehicle owner shall not make a vehicle available as a shared vehicle on a peer-to-peer car sharing program until the safety recall repair has been made. (2)  If a shared vehicle owner receives an actual notice of a safety recall on a shared vehicle while the shared vehicle is made available on the peer-to-peer car sharing program, the shared vehicle owner shall remove the shared vehicle as available on the peer-to-peer car sharing program, as soon as practicably possible after receiving the notice of the safety recall and until the safety recall repair has been made. (3)  If a shared vehicle owner receives an actual notice of a safety recall while the shared vehicle is being used in the possession of a shared vehicle driver, as soon as practicably possible after receiving the notice of the safety recall, the shared vehicle owner shall notify the peer-to-peer car sharing program about the safety recall so that the shared vehicle owner may address the safety recall repair. 14.  The Commissioner of Banking and Insurance may adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to effectuate the purposes of this act. 15.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the tenth month next following enactment. The commissioner may take anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill establishes the Peer-to-Peer Car Sharing Act. Under the bill, a peer-to-peer car sharing program will assume the liability for bodily injury or property damage to third parties or uninsured and underinsured motorist or personal injury protection losses during the private vehicle sharing period in an amount that is no less than the minimum coverage amount for private passenger vehicles. The bill will also require a peer-to-peer car sharing program to assume primary liability if there is a dispute as to who was in control of the shared vehicle at the time of the loss. The bill additionally provides for exclusions in motor vehicle liability insurance policies that will exclude any and all coverage and the duty to defend or indemnify for any claim afforded under a shared vehicle owners motor vehicle insurance policy. The bill further provides recordkeeping requirements for peer-to-peer car sharing programs pertaining to the use of a vehicle and contains consumer protection disclosure requirements for peer-to-peer car sharing programs such as daily rates, fees, and if applicable, any insurance or protection package costs that are charged to the shared vehicle owner or the shared vehicle driver. The bill also provides that a peer-to peer car sharing program notify the shared vehicle owner if the shared vehicle has a lien against it, among other provisions.
