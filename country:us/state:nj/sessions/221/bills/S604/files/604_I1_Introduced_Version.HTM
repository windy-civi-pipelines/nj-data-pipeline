<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A taxpayer that is a
small business employer or farm employer shall be allowed a credit against the
tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), for a
privilege period in an amount equal to the difference of: 1) the minimum hourly
wage required to be paid to an employee pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1966,
c.113 (C.34:11-56a4), following the enactment of P.L.2019, c.32, multiplied by
the number of hours worked by the employee during the privilege period; minus 2)
that minimum hourly wage required to be paid on the day prior to the enactment
of P.L.2019, c.32, including any adjustments to the minimum hourly wage rate
required by law, multiplied by the number of hours worked by the employee
during the privilege period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If the number of
employees employed by the taxpayer during a privilege period for which this
credit is claimed is greater than the number of employees employed by the
taxpayer on the day prior to the enactment of P.L.2019, c.32, the credit
allowed pursuant to this section shall be calculated based on the number of
employees employed on the day prior to the enactment of P.L.2019, c.32.  If the
number of employees employed by the taxpayer during a privilege period for
which a credit is claimed is less than the number of employees employed by the
taxpayer on the day prior to the enactment of P.L.2019, c.32, the credit shall
be calculated based on the number of employees employed by the taxpayer during
the privilege period for which this credit is claimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The credit allowed
pursuant to this section shall not exceed $12,500 for each employee included in
the calculation prescribed by this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The order of priority of
the application of the credit allowed pursuant to this section and any other
credits allowed by law shall be as prescribed by the director.  The amount of
the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to
section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period, together with
any other credits allowed by law, shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax
liability otherwise due and shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount
less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The amount of the tax
credit otherwise allowable under this section which cannot be applied for the
privilege period may be carried forward, if necessary, to the four privilege
periods following the privilege period for which a portion of the tax credit
was allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     No tax credit shall be
allowed pursuant to this section for any costs or expenses included in the
calculation of any other tax credit or exemption granted pursuant to a claim
made on a tax return filed with the director, or included in the calculation of
an award of business assistance or incentive, for a period of time that
coincides with the privilege period for which a tax credit pursuant to this
section is allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    A small business
employer or farm employer shall apply in a form and manner to be determined by
the director for the tax credit provided pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The credit allowed
pursuant to this section shall only be available to a taxpayer for the ten
subsequent privilege periods that commence immediately following the effective
date of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

small business employer or farm employer shall be allowed a credit against the tax
otherwise due under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et
seq., for a taxable year in an amount equal to the difference of: 1) the minimum
hourly wage required to be paid to an employee pursuant to section 5 of

regular hourly rate basis to labor on a farm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Small business employer
means a taxpayer that: 1) employs fewer than 25 employees in this State, which

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill allows corporation
business tax (CBT) credits and gross income tax (GIT) credits for small
business employers and farm employers for payment of the increased State
minimum wage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides small
business employers and farm employers with a tax credit equal to the difference
of: 1) the minimum hourly wage required to be paid to an employee pursuant to
section 5 of P.L.1966, c.113, following the enactment of P.L.2019, c.32, which
phases the State minimum wage up to $15.00 per hour, multiplied by the number
of hours worked by an employee during a privilege period or taxable year; minus
2) that minimum hourly wage required to be paid on the day prior to the
enactment of that same law, factoring in any adjustments to the minimum hourly
wage, such as inflation, as required by law at that time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The term small business
employer means a taxpayer that: 1) employs fewer than 25 employees in this
State, which employees shall have been employed by the employer for not less
than 48 weeks of the calendar year and which are employed by the taxpayer as of
the last day of the calendar year; and 2) generates less than $1 million in
annual net receipts, based on the average of the three preceding privilege
periods or taxable years.  The term farm employer means a taxpayer in this
State who engages individuals in this State on a piece-rate or regular hourly
rate basis to labor on a farm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill restricts the number
of employees that can be used in calculating the tax credit amount, caps the
credit amount at $12,500 for each employee included in the calculation of the
credit, and limits the credits availability to the ten subsequent privilege
periods or taxable years that commence immediately following the effective date
of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any amount of the tax credit
that cannot be taken against a small business employers or farm employers CBT
liability can be carried forward for four privilege periods following the
privilege period for which a portion of the tax credit was allowed.  If the GIT
credit exceeds a small business employers or farm employers liability, the
small business employer or farm employer can receive a refund for the amount in
excess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the Director
of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to determine the
form and manner by which a taxpayer can apply for the tax credit.</p>
