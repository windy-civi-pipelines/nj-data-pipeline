dioxide, brominated vegetable oil, and various synthetic dyes such as FD&amp;C
Yellow 5 and 6, Red 3 and 40, Green 3, and Blue 1 and 2. These substances are
associated with potential health risks, particularly for children.  By limiting
access to foods containing these ingredients, the bill seeks to promote
healthier eating environments in schools and protect student well-being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To support implementation, the
bill also requires the Department of Education to create a standardized
compliance certification form that schools may use to attest they are following
the law. The Department must also publish and maintain a publicly accessible
list of all schools that have submitted this certification, updated annually. </p>
