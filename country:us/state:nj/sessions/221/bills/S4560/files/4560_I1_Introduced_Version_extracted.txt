These substances are associated with potential health risks, particularly for children.  By limiting access to foods containing these ingredients, the bill seeks to promote healthier eating environments in schools and protect student well-being. To support implementation, the bill also requires the Department of Education to create a standardized compliance certification form that schools may use to attest they are following the law. The Department must also publish and maintain a publicly accessible list of all schools that have submitted this certification, updated annually.

The list shall be updated annually. c.  The department may take such actions as are necessary to verify the accuracy of a schools certification and may adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to effectuate the purposes of this section. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, designated the NJ Healthy Schools Act, would prohibit, beginning in September 2026, any school participating in federally funded or assisted meal programs from serving, selling, or permitting a third party to sell ultraprocessed foods on school property during the school day.  The bill would not restrict a parent or guardian from providing ultraprocessed food to their child. The bill defines "ultraprocessed food" as any food or beverage containing certain chemical additives, including potassium bromate, propylparaben, titanium dioxide, brominated vegetable oil, and various synthetic dyes such as FD&C Yellow 5 and 6, Red 3 and 40, Green 3, and Blue 1 and 2. These substances are associated with potential health risks, particularly for children.  By limiting access to foods containing these ingredients, the bill seeks to promote healthier eating environments in schools and protect student well-being. To support implementation, the bill also requires the Department of Education to create a standardized compliance certification form that schools may use to attest they are following the law. The Department must also publish and maintain a publicly accessible list of all schools that have submitted this certification, updated annually.
