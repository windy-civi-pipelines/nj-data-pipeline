the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  a.  As
used in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this
bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Community supported
agriculture means a method of on-the-farm direct sales and marketing in which
the retail sale, to a consumer, of a share of the agricultural output of a
commercial farm is effectuated through a paid subscription service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Community supported
agriculture program or CSA program means a farm product retail sales and
marketing program in which participating consumers agree to pay a seasonal or
annual subscription fee to a farm in exchange for the consumers regular and
ongoing receipt of weekly shares of the farms seasonal agricultural output.</p>

Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Secretary means the

the effective date of P.L.    ,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill), the Secretary of Agriculture shall
develop and implement a publicity and marketing program to promote community
supported agriculture in the State.  As part of the program, the department
shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   establish and regularly
update, on its Internet website, a webpage that is dedicated to community
supported agriculture, which webpage shall, at a minimum:  (a) include a
searchable list of all CSA programs in the State and the farms participating
therein; and (b) provide hyperlinks, or use another simple methodology, to
enable members of the public to subscribe to CSA programs in their local area; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   use all available means,
including, but not limited to, print media, television, radio, road and other
signage, the Internet, and social media to advertise and publicize:  (a) the
availability of, and the benefits of participating in, community supported
agriculture in the State; (b) the names and locations of farms that participate
in CSA programs; and (c) the availability of the community supported
agriculture webpage, established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection;
and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   develop, print, and
distribute distinct promotional and marketing labels that may be used by
farmers to identify agricultural products that are being marketed and sold
through community supported agriculture.  The labels developed pursuant to this
paragraph may contain the official New Jersey State map symbol, developed
pursuant to R.S.4:10-5, as well as a Jersey Fresh, Premium Jersey Fresh, or
Made with Jersey Fresh designation, as deemed by the secretary to be
appropriate, but shall additionally indicate, in large and distinctive
typeface, that the labeled products are being marketed and sold through
community supported agriculture.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to
prohibit the operator of a farm, after first consulting with the department,
from creating the farms own promotional labels and using those labels to
identify agricultural products that are being marketed and sold by the farm
through community supported agriculture.  </p>

Department of Agriculture, acting in cooperation with the Department of
Education and in coordination with farmers, public, private, and charter
schools and their food services, the New Jersey Farm to School Network or its
successor entity, and other interested and relevant organizations and groups,
as determined by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education
to be appropriate, shall establish and annually observe a week of promotional
events to be known as Community Supported Agriculture Week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Community Supported
Agriculture Week shall highlight and promote the value and importance of
community supported agriculture, both as a means by which farming operations
can better ensure their ongoing productivity, success, and financial stability,
and as a means by which individuals, families, and businesses in the State can
obtain fresh, seasonal, and easily accessible farm-to-table foods, throughout
the year, while developing closer, more supportive, and reciprocal
relationships with local farmers and becoming more invested in, and aware of
the factors affecting, the seasonal and long-term success, stability, and
viability of farming operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Community Supported
Agriculture Week shall be celebrated on an annual basis, throughout the State,
during the last full week in February, and shall be observed through the holding
of relevant promotional events.  Such promotional events shall be made
available to members of the public at farms, community farmers markets, farm
stands, grocery stores, community group meetings, churches, and service
organizations; to children at school, through the use of in-class
presentations, food sampling opportunities, and field trips to farms that are
engaged in community supported agriculture; to students of higher education at
on-campus events; and to any other groups or organizations at any other
locations, as may be deemed by the Department of Agriculture to be beneficial
or essential to the effective promotion, throughout the State, of the value and
importance of community supported agriculture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require the
Department of Agriculture (DOA) to take certain actions to publicize and
promote community supported agriculture in the State.  Community supported
agriculture is a method of on-the-farm direct sales and marketing in which the
retail sale, to a consumer, of a share of the agricultural output of a commercial
farm is effectuated through a paid subscription service.  Community supported
agriculture program or CSA program is defined by the bill to mean a farm
product retail sales and marketing program in which participating consumers
agree to pay a seasonal or annual subscription fee to a farm in exchange for
the consumers regular and ongoing receipt of weekly shares of the farms
seasonal agricultural output.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would provide, in
particular, that within 180 days after the bills effective date, the Secretary
of Agriculture is to develop and implement a publicity and marketing program to
promote community supported agriculture in the State.  As part of the program,
the department would be required to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   establish and regularly
update, on its Internet website, a webpage that is dedicated to community
supported agriculture, which webpage, at a minimum, is to include a searchable
list of all CSA programs in the State and the farms participating therein, and
provide hyperlinks, or use another simple methodology, to enable members of the
public to subscribe to CSA programs in their local area; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   use all available means,
including, but not limited to, print media, television, radio, road and other
signage, the Internet, and social media to advertise and publicize:  the
availability of, and the benefits of participating in, community supported
agriculture in the State; the names and locations of farms that participate in
CSA programs; and the availability of the community supported agriculture webpage,
established pursuant to the bill; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   develop, print, and
distribute distinct promotional and marketing labels that may be used by
farmers to identify agricultural products that are being marketed and sold
through community supported agriculture.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing in the bill would
prohibit the operator of a farm, after first consulting with the DOA, from
creating the farms own promotional labels and using those labels to identify
agricultural products that are being marketed and sold by the farm through
community supported agriculture.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also require
the DOA, acting in cooperation with the Department of Education and in
coordination with farmers, public, private, and charter schools and their food
services, the New Jersey Farm to School Network or its successor entity, and
other interested and relevant organizations and groups, as determined by the
Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education to be appropriate, to
establish and annually observe a week of promotional events to be known as
Community Supported Agriculture Week.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Community Supported
Agriculture Week would be intended to highlight and promote the value and
importance of community supported agriculture, both as a means by which farming
operations can better ensure their ongoing productivity, success, and financial
stability, and as a means by which individuals, families, and businesses in the
State can obtain fresh, seasonal, and easily accessible farm-to-table foods,
throughout the year, while developing closer, more supportive, and reciprocal
relationships with local farmers and becoming more invested in, and aware of
the factors affecting, the seasonal and long-term success, stability, and
viability of farming operations.  The week would be celebrated on an annual
basis, throughout the State, during the last full week in February, and would
be observed through the holding of relevant promotional events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would further require
the DOA, through the States existing Farm to School Program, to encourage
schools in the State to obtain fresh, locally grown or produced agricultural
products for school meals by subscribing to, and becoming participants in, a
community supported agriculture program, and to work in cooperation with the
Department of Education to ensure that school curriculum addresses the value
and importance of community supported agriculture, both to farmers and to the
community as a whole, and the ways in which students and their families can
become active participants in community supported agriculture.  In addition,
the bill would require the States existing Farm to School website to:  (1)
provide opportunities for the execution of community supported agriculture
subscription agreements between and among farmers, distributors, and schools or
school districts; (2) facilitate the development and refinement of promotional
events in association with Community Supported Agriculture Week; and (3)
include a copy of any community supported agriculture subscription agreement
that has been entered into and successfully implemented by any school or school
district in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also require
the existing State website that serves as a clearinghouse for farmers, and that
currently provides a list of schools, school districts, and food banks that
have a need for produce or dairy products, to additionally provide a list of
schools, school districts, and food banks that are interested in participating
as subscribers in a community supported agriculture program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes the
Secretary of Agriculture to solicit and receive funds, either as direct
contributions, or from the sale of labels or the right to use labels authorized
by the DOA, or from any other source, for the purposes of advertising and
promoting the value and importance of community supported agriculture in the
State, as provided by the bill.  This authority would be supplemental to the
secretarys existing authority to solicit and receive funds for the purpose of
advertising and promoting the sale of NJ farm products and the Jersey Fresh
program.  Any monies received for the purposes of the bill are to be deposited
in the States existing New Jersey Farm Products Publicity Fund.  The bill
would clarify that, in addition to the existing purposes for which monies in
the New Jersey Farm Products Publicity Fund may be used, such monies may be
used to publicize the value and importance of community supported agriculture;
to cover the expenses of printing and distributing labels used in identifying
products being marketed and sold through community supported agriculture; and
to cover any other expenses that are incident to the implementation of this
bill.</p>
