STATEMENT This bill revises the hours a minor who is 14 or 15 years of age may work with permission from a parent or legal guardian.  If enacted, the bill would allow minors who are 14 or 15 years of age to work until 11 p.m. from Memorial Day to October 1 of each year, with permission from their parent or legal guardian. Under current law, minors who are 14 or 15 years of age may work during the period beginning on the last day of the school year and ending on Labor Day of each year until 9 p.m. The bill does not modify the types of occupations in which minors can work, the total number of hours minors can work, or the required breaks from work an employer is required to provide an employee who is a minor.
