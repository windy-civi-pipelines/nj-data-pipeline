governing body of an educational service agency established pursuant to section
4 of this act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Cooperative pricing system
means a purchasing system in which the educational service agency advertises
for bids or proposals, and awards a master contract that includes estimated
quantities and the prices to be extended to school districts within its zone
and participating nonpublic schools along with other specifications. School
districts and participating nonpublic schools may engage in subordinate
contracts with the vendor, subject to the specifications in the master contract.
The master contract shall be controlling with respect to specifications and
prices, even though quantities are contracted through subordinate contracts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Covered service means
custodial and food services. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Educational service agency
means an agency, serving as a cooperative of school districts and their
respective boards of education, established to contract for custodial and food
services on behalf of school districts within its zone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Predecessor employer means a
school district or a contractor which provided food or custodial services for a
school district or an educational service agency and which ceases to provide
these services. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Recall rights means the
right of any employee dismissed as the result of the adhesion to an educational
service agency master contract to be placed and remain upon a preferred
eligibility list, in the order of years of service, for reemployment whenever
vacancies occur and to be reemployed in such order, and upon reemployment be
given full recognition for previous years of service in their respective
positions and employments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Representative assembly
means a body established pursuant to section 3 of this act composed of
representatives from each member school district. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Service employee means an
employee employed on or around school district premises and central kitchens to
provide food or custodial services, except for managerial, executive,
confidential employees, and employees who work less than four hours per week. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Successor contractor means a
contractor that has been awarded a food or custodial services contract to
provide services that, in whole or in part, are substantially similar to those
food or custodial services provided by a predecessor employer within the
preceding 90 days. </p>

shall be established an educational service agency in each county. The zones of
each respective agency shall be coterminous with the county in which it is
located. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, membership in an
agency shall be automatic for each school district in that zone that has chosen
to use a private contractor with respect to a covered service, except that in
cases in which the contractor has chosen to contract for only one type of
covered service their membership shall be automatic only for that specific
covered service. </a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Notwithstanding the
provisions of any other law to the contrary, a school district seeking to
contract for a service included in subsection a. of this section, shall acquire
the service only through the master contract awarded by the educational service
agency, beginning in the first  school year following the establishment of the
educational service agency in the respective county.   An educational service
agency may petition for an extension by a majority vote of the board of
directors, which the commissioner may grant upon a determination that the educational
service agency is not yet prepared to enter into a master contract for the
provision of the covered services.  If an extension is granted, member school
districts seeking to contract for a covered service shall acquire the service
only through a master contract awarded by the educational services agency,
beginning in the second school year following the establishment of the
educational service agency.  Any school district bid document or contract for a
service that is included in subsection a. of this section which is not part of
the master contract shall be beyond the authority of the school district to
advertise or award, and shall be void from its inception. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     This act shall not be
construed to void or impair any existing contract between a school district and
a private contractor for a covered service executed prior to the effective date
of this act, except that such a contract shall not be renewed or extended. Upon
the expiration of such a previously existing contract, the school district 
shall utilize the master contract if the district continues to utilize a
private contractor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    No entity other than a
school district or a nonpublic school that is a child nutrition program
operator under federal law, shall be eligible to be a part of a contract
reached by the educational service agency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

first representative assembly shall organize upon the call of the executive
county superintendent. Thereafter the representative assembly shall organize
annually during the first week of June and meet at such other times as are
necessary. </p>

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill mandates the
consolidation of procurement of food and custodial services through educational
service agencies established at the county level.  These educational service
agencies will facilitate cost savings through economies of scale, while preserving
school district control over core school district functions. This bill protects
employees providing custodial and food services who may be subject to
disruptive and unnecessary displacement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes an
educational service agency in each county, which will serve as a cooperative of
school districts to contract for custodial and food services, the covered
services under the bill. Under the bill, membership in an agency will be
automatic for each school district in that county that  uses a private
contractor with respect to a covered service, except that in cases in which the
district has chosen to contract for only one type of covered service its
membership will be automatic only for that specific covered service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a school
district may acquire a contracted service only through the master contract of
the educational service agency.  The bill provides that no entity other than a
school district, or a nonpublic school that is a child nutrition program
operator under federal law, will be eligible to be a part of a contract reached
by the educational service agency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes a
representative assembly for the educational service agency that is charged with
adopting a budget for the agency and counseling and advising the board of
directors of the agency.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs each
educational service agency to establish a board of directors.  The board is
responsible for appointing a superintendent or chief school administrator of
the agency who must possess a certificate appropriate to the position, and for
appointing a board secretary whose specific responsibilities are set forth in
the bill.  The board is also permitted to employ such other persons as
necessary to perform its administrative duties and those employees will have
the same rights and benefits as persons employed by a board of education .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>       The board of directors may
purchase, lease-purchase, or lease personal or real property in accordance with
rules and regulations of the State Board of Education and may enter into a
contract with and receive and administer funds and grants from any individual
or agency including, but not limited to, agencies of the federal government. 
The board may also enter into a contract with a nonpublic school for the
provision of covered services.  The board of directors may establish minimum
wage, benefits, and paid leave standards for its employees and contractors, in
accordance with State and federal law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
representative assembly to annually adopt a budget for the ensuing fiscal year,
which contains the estimated cost of providing each service, and submit the
budget to the board of directors for approval. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the agency
will operate as a cooperative pricing system. The provision of services will be
conducted pursuant to the Public School Contracts Law, N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et
seq., and notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, contracts for
covered services will be secured via competitive contracting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that if a
school district is using its own employees to provide a covered service, the
district may not adhere to an educational service agency master contract for
that covered service when doing so would affect the employment of any employees
in a collective bargaining unit during the term that an existing collective
bargaining agreement is in effect unless the school district meets certain
requirements.  Each employee replaced or displaced as the result of the school
districts adhesion to an educational service agencys master contract will
retain all previously acquired seniority and will have recall rights whenever
the districts participation in the agencys master contract terminates. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a school
district which violates certain provisions of the bill will be deemed to have
committed an unfair practice and any employee or majority representative
organization affected by the violation may file an unfair practice charge with
the New Jersey Public Employment Relations Commission. The bill provides numerous
protections for food and custodial service employees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that a school district which is a member of an educational service agency may
withdraw from membership by adopting a resolution setting forth its intention
to withdraw and the reason or reasons for the withdrawal, and filing a
certified copy of the resolution with the executive county superintendent and
secretary of the board of directors.</p>
