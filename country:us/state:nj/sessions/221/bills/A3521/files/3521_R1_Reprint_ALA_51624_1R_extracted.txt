Any sum collected as a fine or penalty pursuant to this section shall be applied toward enforcement of this act and administration costs of the Occupational Heat-related Illness and Injury Prevention Program established within the Department of Labor and Workforce Development. 1[11.] 10.1 Any employer who willfully hinders or delays the commissioner in the performance of the commissioners duties in the enforcement of this act, or fails to make, keep, and preserve any records as required under the provisions of this act, or falsifies any record, or refuses to make any record accessible to the commissioner upon demand, or refuses to furnish a sworn statement of the record or any other information required for the proper enforcement of this act to the commissioner or otherwise violates any provision of this act or of any departmental rule promulgated or order issued under this act shall be guilty of a disorderly persons offense and shall, upon conviction for a first violation 1within 365 days following the establishment of rules by the commissioner1, be punished by a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than 90 days, or by both the fine and imprisonment and, upon conviction for a second or subsequent violation, shall be punished by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $5,000 or by imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than 100 days, or by both the fine and imprisonment.  1Penalties shall be adjusted every five years by the commissioner in direct proportion to the rise or fall of the consumer price index as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.1 1[12.] 11.1           a.  If the commissioner determines, after either an initial determination as a result of an audit of a business or an investigation pursuant to this act, that an employer is in violation of this act, the commissioner may issue a stop-work order against the employer requiring cessation of all business operations of the employer at one or more worksites or across all of the employers worksites and places of business. The stop-work order may be issued only against the employer found to be in violation or non-compliance.  The commissioner shall serve a notification of intent to issue a stop-work order on the employer at the place of business or, for a particular employer worksite, at that worksite, at least seven days prior to the issuance of a stop-work order.  The stop-work order shall be effective when served upon the employer at the place of business or, for a particular employer worksite, when served at that worksite.  The stop-work order shall remain in effect until the commissioner issues an order releasing the stop-work order upon finding that the employer has come into compliance and has paid any administrative penalty deemed to be satisfactory to the commissioner, or after the commissioner determines, in a hearing held pursuant to subsection b. of this section, that the employer did not commit the act on which the order was based.  The stop-work order shall be effective against any successor entity engaged in the same or equivalent trade or activity that has one or more of the same principals or officers as the corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or sole proprietorship against which the stop-work order was issued. The commissioner may assess a civil penalty of $5,000 per day1, within 365 days following the establishment of rules by the commissioner,1 against an employer for each day that it conducts business operations that are in violation of the stop-work order.  A request for hearing shall not automatically stay the effect of the order.  1Penalties shall be adjusted every five years by the commissioner in direct proportion to the rise or fall of the consumer price index as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 1 b.   An employer who is subject to a stop-work order shall, within 72 hours of its receipt of the notification, have the right to appeal to the commissioner in writing for an opportunity to be heard and contest the stop-work order. c.   Within seven business days of receipt of the notification from the employer, the commissioner shall hold a hearing to allow the employer to contest the issuance of a stop-work order.  The department and the employer may present evidence and make any arguments in support of their respective positions regarding the findings of the audit or investigation.  The commissioner shall issue a written decision within five business days of the hearing either upholding or reversing the employers stop-work order.  The decision shall include the grounds for upholding or reversing the employers stop-work order.  If the employer disagrees with the written decision, the employer may appeal the decision to the commissioner, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). d.   If the employer does not request an appeal to the commissioner in writing, the stop-work order shall become a final order after the expiration of the 72-hour period. e.   The commissioner may compromise any civil penalty assessed under this section in an amount the commissioner determines to be appropriate. f.     Once the stop-work order becomes final, any employee affected by a stop-work order issued pursuant to this section shall be entitled to pay from the employer for the first ten days of work lost because of the stop-work.  Upon request of any employee not paid wages, the commissioner can take assignment of the claim and bring any legal action necessary to collect all that is due. 1[13.] 12.1  After each employer has, under section 3 of this act, implemented a heat-related illness and injury prevention plan in accordance with the requirements of the departments heat stress standard, each employer shall on or before May 1 of each subsequent year, or the next business day, if May 1 falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, review and subsequently release and communicate to their employees and any authorized representatives of their employees, including their collective bargaining representatives, an updated version of the employers heat-related illness and injury prevention plan.  Employers heat-related illness and injury prevention plans may not need revision, but employers shall be required to conduct an annual review to determine whether revisions are necessary. 1[14.] 13.1  The statute of limitations under this act shall be six years after the alleged cause of action accrues. 1[15.] 14.1            a.  Beginning immediately following enactment of this act, in each instance in which a place of employment experiences excessive heat, an employer shall: (1) postpone tasks that are 1[not urgent] non-essential1 until the 1[period of]1 excessive heat 1[has ended] condition subsides1; (2) take all necessary measures to reduce the heat exposure of each worker, including but not limited to, shortening work shifts by increasing the number of shifts and the corresponding total number of workers; (3) increase rest allowances1, which shall be paid1; (4) permit workers to drink liquids in small amounts frequently to prevent dehydration; (5) monitor the environmental heat at job sites and resting places; (6) permit employees to contact the employer directly and efficiently to communicate if they believe they are suffering from a heat-related illness; (7) conduct initial and regular monitoring for employee exposure to heat to determine whether an employees exposure has been excessive; (8) provide 132 ounces of1 potable water 1per hour to each employee, in immediate proximity of each employee,1 with a temperature of less than 59 degrees Fahrenheit; (9) provide paid rest breaks and access to shade, cool-down areas or climate-controlled spaces in accordance with heat index levels in the National Weather Service Heat Index Chart; (10) provide an emergency response for any employee who has suffered injury as a result of being exposed to excessive heat; 1and1 (11) 1[acclimatize employees to areas where exposure to heat is present; and (12)]1 limit the length of time an employee may be exposed to heat during the workday. b.   Excessive heat shall be defined by the commissioner through the rules adopted pursuant to section 1[10] 9.1 of this act; provided, however, until rules are adopted, for the purposes of this section, excessive heat shall mean: (1) for an outdoor place of employment, a heat index at or above 1[90] 801 degrees Fahrenheit according to the National Weather Service Heat Index Chart; and (2) for an indoor place of employment, the temperature equals or exceeds 1[87] 801 degrees Fahrenheit when employees are present; the heat index equals or exceeds 1[87] 801 degrees Fahrenheit when employees are present; employees wear clothing that restricts heat removal, and the temperature equals or exceeds 1[82] 751 degrees Fahrenheit; or employees work in a high radiant heat area and the temperature equals or exceeds 1[82] 751 degrees Fahrenheit. 1[16.] 15.1  This act shall take effect immediately, except that the department rules establishing a heat stress standard shall be issued on or before June 1, 1[2024] 20251.
