(2)  The documents submitted and maintained in the database may include the following, within the discretion of the State Treasurer: the organization's charter, articles of organization, certificate of incorporation, agreement of association, instrument of trust, constitution or other organizational instrument and bylaws. valid standing certificate or certificate of business registration issued by the appropriate agency. proof of the nonprofit organization's tax-exempt status, such as copies of federal or state tax exemption determination or exemption ruling letters. proof of registration with the Attorney General if required pursuant to the New Jersey Charitable Registration and Investigation Act, N.J.S.A. 45:17A-18 et seq., or documentation of exemption from such registration. audited financial statements, if required by State or federal law. affidavit that the nonprofit organization has not participated in any collusion with any other bidder or owner representative or otherwise taken any action in restraint of free and competitive bidding. disclosure of investigations, litigation, complaints, or other administrative proceedings involving any public sector clients. certificate or disclosure concerning investments, operations, or activities in foreign countries as may be required by law and compliance with such laws. names of the nonprofit organizations current directors, officers and trustees. proof of all relevant insurance. acknowledgement that the nonprofit organization complies with all provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. certificate or disclosure of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action compliance. certificate or disclosure indicating that no political contributions prohibited by law have been made by the nonprofit organization with regard to public contracts. form W-9 issued by the Internal Revenue Service to confirm a name, address, and taxpayer identification number for employment or other income-generating purposes. certificate or disclosure of non-debarment for federal government contracts and of non-debarment for State contracts. The State Treasurer may permit the submission of other documents relevant to bids for and awards of public contracts and grants as the State Treasurer may determine to be appropriate for the purpose of the database. The information maintained in the database shall exclude personal identifying information of individuals to prevent compromising personal privacy and security as such information is permitted or required to be redacted in accordance with P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.). State agencies or local government agencies seeking to award a contract or grant shall utilize the documentation submitted to the database by a nonprofit organization pursuant to this subsection.  The State agency or local government agency may request any documentation not held by the database for such nonprofit organization. c.  State agencies and local government agencies shall review and adopt the cost principles and federal grant reforms contained in the federal Office of Management and Budgets Uniform Guidance standards with regard to nonprofit organizations to the extent permitted by law. d.  The State Treasurer and local government agencies may create a list of common terminology relevant to contracts or grants for nonprofit organizations to define services, processes, and client populations and a list of common terminology for contracts or grants to be accessible to all State and local government agencies. e.  The amount of any contract, awarded by a State agency or local government agency, determined for the prior calendar year shall be adjusted annually in direct proportion to the percent change in the Consumer Price Index over a 12-month period beginning November 1 and ending October 31.  For the purpose of this section, "Consumer Price Index" means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Area, All Items (1982-84=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor.  The amount of the adjustment should be determined by December 1 of each year and the adjustment shall become effective for payments to be made during the calendar year following the determination, beginning with payments made on or after January 1 of each calendar year.  An adjustment in the amount of such contract shall be made only if the percent change in the Consumer Price Index for the period specified is greater than zero.  If the reference base of the index is changed, the index used to determine the Consumer Price Index shall be the index converted to the new base by standard statistical methods. f.  A contract awarded by a State agency or local government agency shall automatically be extended for a period of three months if the extension or renewal process is not completed within 10 days of expiration of such contract. g.  No unilateral change of contract language or terms shall be permitted by a State agency or local government agency for a contract awarded to a nonprofit organization. h.  The State Treasurer and local government agencies shall develop procedures to reduce redundant monitoring of nonprofit organizations that have been awarded contracts or grants by standardizing and integrating reporting procedures across all State or local government agencies. i.  (1)  Interest shall be paid on the amount due to a nonprofit organization pursuant to a properly executed State agency or local government agency contract, when required, if the required payment is not made on or before the required payment date.
