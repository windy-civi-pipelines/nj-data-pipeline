S1408 1R SCS [First Reprint] SENATE COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE FOR SENATE, No. 1408 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE ADOPTED MARCH 17, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  TROY SINGLETON District 7 (Burlington) Senator  BENJIE E. WIMBERLY District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) Co-Sponsored by: Senator Zwicker SYNOPSIS Authorizes conversion of certain office parks and retail centers to mixed-used developments. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As amended by the Senate on June 2, 2025. An Act concerning the conversion of certain office parks and retail centers to mixed-use developments and supplementing chapter 55D of Title 40 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares: a.     New Jersey is one of the most suburban states in the country. b.    The rapid suburban-sprawl development of New Jersey after World War II coincided with a shift toward highway construction and automobile dependency and led to the proliferation of single-use commercial buildings such as large retail centers and office parks. c.     While, for decades, large retail centers and office parks provided economic and social benefits to New Jersey and its residents, their prevalence has been in sharp decline based on economic influences, consumer preferences, and retail and business alternatives. Many of these declining large retail centers and office parks are dated or vacant, such that academics and planners have deemed them to be "stranded assets. " d.    Workers and employers want to be located in mixed-use communities, which offer easy access to a range of residential, commercial, and recreational spaces and amenities within walking distance of each other.  Converting stranded office parks and retail centers into desirable mixed-use communities would promote the general welfare by revitalizing underused or underperforming properties, creating new opportunities for housing, businesses, and recreational facilities, and bolstering the economic and social vitality of New Jerseys municipalities. e.     One significant impediment to converting stranded retail centers and office parks into dynamic mixed-use communities is the application of outdated, rigid municipal zoning regulations that often separate residential and commercial uses from each other. f.     To encourage the development of vibrant and desirable mixed-use communities, further to the public good, it is appropriate for the Legislature to set standards to modernize local land use regulations that stand in the way of the repurposing and redevelopment of stranded retail centers and office parks. 2.    a.  As used in this section: "Eligible property" means an office park or a retail center that meets the requirements of subsection c. of this section. "Developer" shall have the same meaning as defined in section 34 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.3). "Mixed-use development" shall have the same meaning as defined in section 34 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.3). "Office park" means a non-residential land use developed as a single entity combining general, business, professional, or medical offices that contain ancillary personal services primarily for employees located on a single site and planned, developed, and managed as a unit. "Retail center" means a non-residential land use developed as a single entity combining retail stores and potentially other commercial uses located on a single site and planned, developed, and managed as a unit. 1"Vacancy rate" means the percentage of unoccupied or unused square footage in a structure or facility, compared to the total square footage of the structure or facility.1 b.    A municipal planning board enforcing municipal zoning regulations shall permit conversions or partial conversions of eligible properties into mixed-use developments pursuant to the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     A developer of a proposed project to repurpose or redevelop a retail center or office park into a mixed-use development in accordance with the provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall demonstrate that the retail center or office park located on the lot or land included in the application for development meets the following requirements to be deemed an eligible property: (1)   the office park is at least 50,000 square feet or the retail center is at least 15,000 square feet; 1[and]1 (2)   (a) the office park or retail center has a vacancy rate of at least 25 percent for 1a continuous period of1 at least 18 months immediately preceding the application for development; or (b) the office park or retail center has suffered an economic downturn over the three-year period immediately preceding the date of the application, as demonstrated by evidence of a quantifiable loss in revenue such that the developers expenses for the premises have exceeded revenues by 30 percent or more each year 1; and (3)   the owner of the property has made and maintained a continuous, good faith effort to redress the vacancy, actively rent, or actively market the property during the 18 months immediately preceding the application for development1. d.    A mixed-use development that is the subject of an application for development to convert an eligible property shall be a permitted use and shall not require a use variance pursuant to subsection d. of section 57 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-70) if the application for development complies with the following requirements: (1)   the mixed-use development, which may include the demolition of existing structures, complies with the zoning requirements applicable to development projects within the municipalitys mixed-use zone as provided in subsection e. of this section; (2)   the application proposes to develop at least two types of uses as part of the mixed-use development, of which one use is residential, and no use shall be industrial; (3)   at least 20 percent of the residential units to be constructed shall be reserved as or very-low income housing, low-income housing, or moderate-income housing, as those terms are defined in section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304); (4)   of the residential units reserved as very low-income housing, low-income housing, or moderate-income housing, at least 50 percent within each bedroom distribution are low-income units, and at least 13 percent of the low-income units are very-low income units; and (5)   the residential units reserved as very low-income housing, low-income housing, or moderate-income housing comply with the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls, adopted to implement P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et seq.). e.     (1)  The municipal planning board shall approve an application to repurpose or redevelop an eligible property into a mixed-use development notwithstanding the eligible propertys location in the municipality if the project complies with the zoning requirements applicable to projects within the municipalitys mixed-use zone.
