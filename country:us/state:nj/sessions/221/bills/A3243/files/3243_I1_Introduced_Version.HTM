A3243 ASSEMBLY, No. 3243 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  AURA K. DUNN District 25 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Directs Commissioner of Education to develop guidelines on outdoor education opportunities. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning public school curriculum and supplementing chapter 35 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  The Commissioner of Education shall develop guidelines to incorporate outdoor education opportunities in the public school curriculum.  The guidelines shall identify: (1)   ways to create and expand outdoor learning opportunities for students, including field trips; and (2)   resources and training opportunities for public school teachers on outdoor learning protocols and best practices. b. Each board of education shall be encouraged, to the greatest extent practicable and subject to available funding, to incorporate the guidelines developed pursuant to subsection a. of this section as part of the curriculum for the district's elementary and secondary school students. 2.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall first apply to the first full school year following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill directs the Commissioner of Education to develop guidelines to incorporate outdoor education opportunities in the public school curriculum.  The guidelines are required to identify: (1) ways to create and expand outdoor learning opportunities, including field trips, for students; and (2) resources and training opportunities for public school teachers on outdoor learning protocols and best practices. The bill further provides that each board of education is encouraged, to the greatest extent practicable and subject to available funding, to incorporate the guidelines as part of the curriculum for the district's elementary and secondary school students. Outdoor learning provides an opportunity for school districts, parents, and local communities to proactively combat the impact of both Covid-related learning loss and mental health challenges experienced by the States youth.  A recent study of American children reports that parents of children eight to 12 years old said that their children spend three times as many hours with computers and televisions each week as they do playing outside.  Further, according to mental health professionals, the rates of depression and anxiety observed in young people are soaring. In December 2021, Surgeon-General Vivek Murthy declared that the United States had entered a youth mental health crisis.  Experts know that exposure to nature can help relieve depression and anxiety, and even help heal trauma.  Multiple studies show that spending time outdoors has positive effects on physical and mental health. For young people in particular, nature exposure can boost concentration, improve social skills and even help them perform better in school. It is the sponsors belief that providing increased outdoor education opportunities will contribute in positive ways to students physical health, mental health, and academic outcomes.
