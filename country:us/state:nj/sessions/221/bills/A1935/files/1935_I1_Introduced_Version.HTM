If the purchaser of a used motor vehicle purchased by private sale, as that term is defined in section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), applies to a licensed motor vehicle dealer for a certificate of ownership and certificate of registration and complies with the provisions of section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and all rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, the purchaser shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this subsection.

E.    Nothing in subsections C. and D. of this section shall apply to security interests in motor vehicles which constitute inventory held for sale, but such interests shall be subject to chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes, nor shall anything in the said subsections apply to interests in personal property subject to chapter 28 of Title 46 of the Revised Statutes. F.    In addition to the fees elsewhere in this section provided for, there shall be paid to the [director] chief administrator at the time a certificate of ownership is issued a fee of $10 for notice of satisfaction of the lien or encumbrance of the record or abstract, or of the termination of the security interest, where the motor vehicle is subject to a lien or encumbrance or a security interest as provided in R.S.39:10-14. G.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, when any dealer licensed under the provisions of R.S.39:10-19 is the purchaser of a motor vehicle in this State, he may, within 10 working days after its purchase, submit to the [director] chief administrator the evidence of purchase.  Upon presentation of the certificate of ownership with proper assignment and certification of the seller to the [director] chief administrator, a record of the transaction shall be made and filed.

I.     The failure of any person to comply with the requirements of this section shall not constitute a misdemeanor within the provisions of R.S.39:10-24, nor shall such failure affect the validity of any instrument creating or reserving a security interest in a motor vehicle, as between the parties to such instrument. J.     The notation of the name and business or residence address of a secured party or his assignee, on the certificate of origin or on the certificate of ownership, as provided in R.S.39:10-8 and R.S.39:10-9, and the presentation to the [director] chief administrator, in accordance with R.S.39:10-11, of the certificate of origin or certificate of ownership so noted, and the compliance with the requirements of subsections C. and D. of R.S.39:10-11 shall be in lieu of all filing requirements imposed by chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes and shall constitute the perfection of a security interest in the motor vehicle, and the rights and remedies of the debtors and the secured parties in respect to such security interest shall, except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, be subject to and governed by chapter 9 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes.

STATEMENT This bill requires the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (commission) to permit a licensed motor vehicle dealer to facilitate the issuance of a certificate of ownership and certificate of registration for a used motor vehicle that is purchased by private sale if the vehicle is to be registered in New Jersey and complies with all requirements for issuance of a certificate of ownership and certificate of registration.

The bill requires the Chief Administrator of the commission to adopt temporary rules and regulations within three months of the effective date of the bill.  The temporary rules and regulations are to be effective for a period not to exceed one year from the date they are filed with the Office of Administrative Law.  The bill provides that the rules and regulations are to be amended, adopted, or readopted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.
