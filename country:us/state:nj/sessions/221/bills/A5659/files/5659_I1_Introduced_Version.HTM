class=BillHead>An Act</span><span class=HangingAnActChar> </span>establishing a
commission to study the assessment and taxation of residential real property
and supplementing Title 52 of the New Jersey Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  The Legislature finds and
declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  The property tax burden in
this State has become untenable for families, senior citizens, first-time
homeowners, and renters, and it is past time for this burden to be lifted from
the backs of New Jerseys residents.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  On August 20, 2024, the
Tax Foundation published an article by Audrey Yushkov titled Property Taxes by
State and County, 2024.  This article notes that of the 15 counties in the
United States with the highest median property tax payments (exceeding
$10,000), seven of those counties are located in New Jersey:  Bergen, Essex,
Hunterdon, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, and Union.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  That article also noted
that in calendar year 2022, New Jersey had the highest effective tax rate on
owner-occupied property in the nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  In 2024, for the first
time in New Jersey history, the average<b> </b>property tax bill was more than
$10,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  Combined with other cost
drivers, including utilities and insurance, living in New Jersey has become financially
hazardous to the health and well-being of the States property taxpayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  Because this situation has
taken decades to occur, it will take a thoughtful and meaningful process to
develop solutions to these problems.  Therefore, a commission to study the
property tax burden of homeowners and develop solutions to lower residential
property taxes is necessary and appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  There is hereby
established a commission in, but not of, the Department of the Treasury, to be
known as the New Jersey Commission to Reform the Assessment and Taxation of
Residential Real Property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  (1)  The commission shall
examine the property tax system in New Jersey in its entirety, including but
not limited to the assessment and collection of property taxes, the funding of
county government, municipal government, school districts, and fire districts
in the State, and shall identify ways in which the system can be revised and improved
in order to reduce the property tax burden on residential real property owners
in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  The commission shall
recommend such amendments to the New Jersey Constitution and revisions to statutory
law, as necessary, to:  eliminate inequities in the current system of property
taxation regarding the assessment of residential real property; ensure greater
uniformity in the application of property taxes on residential real property;
reduce residential property taxes as an overall share of local revenue; lessen
the dependence of local government on residential property taxes; and establish
alternative means to permanently and reliably fund local government services,
including education funding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  As part of its study, the
commission may: examine the functions, duties, operations, and programs of
local units of government; review statutes, regulations, ordinances,
resolutions, opinions, orders, and agreements that govern the imposition,
assessment, and collection of property taxes; and recommend exemptions,
deductions, and other benefits that reduce or offset a taxpayers property tax
liability.  The commission shall also study and analyze property tax assessment
and collection mechanisms in other states, and shall evaluate systems of property
tax reform that have been proposed or implemented in other states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The commission shall issue
a final report of its findings, conclusions, and recommendations no later than
18 months following its organization.  The final report shall be submitted to
the Governor, and to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164
(C.52:14-19.1).  The commissions final report shall identify any pending legislation
that the commission recommends for adoption by the Legislature, as well as any
changes to the New Jersey Constitution for submission to the voters in addition
to such other recommendations as the commission deems necessary.  The
commissions final report shall be made available to the public electronically,
through a link prominently displayed on the official website of the Department
of the Treasury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  The commission shall
expire 30 days following the date of the issuance of its final report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  The commission shall
consist of 11 voting members as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the State Treasurer, ex
officio, or the State Treasurers designee;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   one public member
appointed by the President of the Senate;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  one public member
appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  one public member
appointed by the Senate Minority Leader; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  one public member
appointed by the Assembly Minority Leader; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  six public members
appointed by the Governor, of whom at least two members shall reside in each of
the northern, central, and southern regions of the State, respectively, and at
least one member shall reside in an urban area, a suburban area of the State,
and a rural area of the State, respectively.</p>

Commission to Reform the Assessment and Taxation of Residential Real Property,
to examine the property tax system in New Jersey in its entirety and identify

commission to recommend such amendments to the New Jersey Constitution and revisions
to statutory law as may be necessary to:  eliminate inequities in the current
system of property taxation regarding the assessment of residential real
property; ensure greater uniformity in the application of property taxes on
residential real property; reduce residential property taxes as an overall
share of local revenue; lessen the dependence of local government on residential
property taxes; and establish alternative sources of revenue to permanently and
reliably fund local government services, including education funding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission would include
11 voting members, appointed as follows:  (1) the State Treasurer, ex officio,
or the State Treasurers designee; (2) one public member appointed by the
President of the Senate; (3) one public member appointed by the Speaker of the

Leader; (5) one public member appointed by the Assembly Minority Leader; and (6)
six public members appointed by the Governor, of whom at least two members
reside in each of the northern, central, and southern regions of the State, and

property assessment and valuation, and the implementation, practice,
administration, and regulation of property tax policy.  A public member may not

commission to issue a final report of its findings, conclusions, and
recommendations no later than 18 months following its organization, and
provides that the commission would expire 30 days following the date of the issuance
of that report.  The report is to be made available to the public electronically,
