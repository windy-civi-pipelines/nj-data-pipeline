STATEMENT This resolution designates November 21 of each year as Urinary Tract Infection Awareness Day in New Jersey.  A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system.  The urinary tract system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.  UTIs typically occur when bacteria enters the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to spread in the bladder.  In older adults, UTIs may be overlooked or mistaken for other conditions.  UTIs can cause sudden confusion, also known as delirium, in older adults.  If an older adult has a sudden and unexplained change in their behavior, such as increased confusion, agitation, or withdrawal, this may be because of a UTI.  Formulation of a successful diagnostic and treatment plan is based on determining the location of the UTI and identifying underlying physical impairments of the patient, such as diabetes. UTIs do not always cause symptoms, but when symptoms do arise they may include a strong urge to urinate that does not go away, a burning feeling when urinating, urinating often, passing small amount of urine, urine that looks cloudy, and strong-smelling urine.  UTI infections that go untreated can spread from the bladder to the kidneys and ultimately lead to a life threatening infection known as sepsis. The best way to prevent a UTI is to urinate every few hours, empty ones bladder completely, drink plenty of water, and practice good genital and urinary hygiene.  Designating November 21 of each year as Urinary Tract Infection Awareness Day would provide New Jerseyans with an annual reminder on the negative health effects that UTIs have on the New Jerseyans across the State.
