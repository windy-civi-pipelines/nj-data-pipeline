<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill increases to 70
percent of compensation the accidental death benefit payable to the surviving
spouse or surviving child or children of a deceased law enforcement officer,
correction officer, or firefighter who was a member of the Public Employees
Retirement System (PERS) and ineligible for membership in the Police and
Firemens Retirement System (PFRS). This bill also changes the definition of child
with respect to those members. The bill permits payment of an accidental death
benefit to a surviving beneficiary of a retirant of the PFRS or a retirant of
the PERS who was ineligible for membership in the PFRS if the accident caused
the death of the retirant. The bill also grants eligibility for the death
benefit to a person determined by the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance to
be eligible to receive a death benefit under the federal Public Safety
Officers Benefits Act of 1976 based upon the death of a law enforcement
officer, correction officer, or firefighter member or retirant of the PERS who
was ineligible for membership in the PFRS or member or retirant of the PFRS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, an
accidental death benefit under PERS is payable when a member dies accidentally
in the actual performance of duty, or in active service in the reserve
component of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard in a
federal active duty status, and not as the result of his or her willful
negligence. The members widow or widower is entitled to a pension of 50
percent of the members compensation for use by him or her and the children of
the deceased member. This payment continues during his or her widowhood. If
there is no surviving widow or widower, or in case the widow or widower dies or
remarries, 20 percent of that compensation is payable to one surviving child,
35 percent to two surviving children in equal shares, and 50 percent to three
or more surviving children in equal shares.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With respect to all law
enforcement officers, correction officers, or firefighters in PERS, this bill
increases to 70 percent of the members compensation the accidental death
benefit payable to the surviving spouse of the member or retirant, and to the
same amount the benefit payable to the members or retirants surviving child
or children when there is no surviving spouse. This provision will mirror the
amounts as provided in the PFRS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also changes the
definition of child with respect to all law enforcement officers, correction
officers, and firefighters in PERS. Currently, in that retirement system,
child is defined as a deceased member's unmarried child either (a) under the
age of 18 or (b) of any age who, at the time of the member's death, is disabled
because of an intellectual disability or physical incapacity, is unable to do
any substantial, gainful work because of the impairment and the impairment has
lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12
months, as affirmed by the medical board. For those officers and firefighters
in PERS, this bill adds to this definition a members or retirants child who
is (c) 18 years of age or older and enrolled in a secondary school, or (d)
under the age of 24 and enrolled in a degree program in an institution of
higher education for at least 12 credit hours in each semester, provided that
the member or retirant died as a result of an accident met in the actual
performance of duty at some definite time and place, and the death was not the
result of the member's or retirants willful misconduct. This definition will
be the same as the definition of child in the PFRS, as amended to include
retirants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that a person determined by the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance to be
eligible to receive a death benefit under the federal Public Safety Officers
Benefits Act of 1976 (PSOB) based upon the death of a law enforcement officer,
correction officer, or firefighter member or retirant in the PERS who was
ineligible for membership in the PFRS is eligible to receive the accidental
death benefit. The bill provides the same eligibility for a person determined
by the bureau to be eligible for a death benefit under the PSOB for a member or
retirant in the PFRS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If enacted, the change in the
definition of child, the amount of the benefit to a surviving spouse, child, or
children, and the change in the benefit for an individual determined eligible
under the PSOB would apply to a benefit initially granted on or after September
11, 2001. The bill provides for an adjustment in the amount of the benefit
retroactive to the death of the member or retirement occurring after September 11,
2001. The retroactive payment being based upon the difference between the
benefit the beneficiary would have received if the adjustment made pursuant to the
bill had been applicable at the date of entitlement and the benefit that the
beneficiary received from the date of entitlement to the effective date of the
bill.</p>
