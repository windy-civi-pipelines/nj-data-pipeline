<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>establishing the Council for Community Recovery
and Family Success, supplementing Title 9 of the Revised Statutes, and making
an appropriation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     1.    The
Legislature finds and declares that:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     a.     As
a State, our child and family services and the resources appropriated to fund
those services are primarily designed to respond to crisis-related events. 
Consequently, the services provided to children and their families struggle to
produce long-term positive results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     b.    A
growing body of literature suggests that comprehensive, integrated, and
sustained investments in family support, prevention, early intervention, and
infant, child, youth, and family well-being are more cost-effective than a
fragmented approach of various programs providing services that only address
the symptoms that cause family crises and distress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     c.     The
solution to improving outcomes for all children and families in New Jersey is
to provide an interdisciplinary approach to family support and preventive
services and to enact a Bill of Rights for Infants, Children, Youth, and Families
in New Jersey.  A Bill of Rights, which would be based on the United Nations
Treaty on the Rights of the Child, would recognize and protect the rights of
infants, children, youth, and families in New Jersey and provide a framework
for the provision of preventive services to at-risk infants, children, and
youth and their families.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     d.    It
is therefore in the best interests of the State to invest in and implement
programs, which promote prevention, early intervention, and the well-being of infants,
children, youth, and families in order to improve the outcomes for all infants,
children, youth, and families who reside in New Jersey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     2.    a. 
There is established the Council for Community Recovery and Family Success in,
but not of, the Department of Community Affairs.  For the purpose of complying
with the provisions of Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey
Constitution, the Council for Community Recovery and Family Success is
allocated within the Department of Community Affairs but, notwithstanding this
allocation, the council shall be independent of any supervision or control by
the department or by any officer or employee thereof.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     b.    The
council shall consist of 25 members as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     (1)   the
Commissioners of Children and Families, Community Affairs, Corrections,
Education, Health, Human Services, and Labor and Workforce Development, and the
Executive Director of the Juvenile Justice Commission in the Department of Law
and Public Safety, or their designees, who shall serve ex officio;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     (2)   13
public members appointed by the Governor, which members shall include
representatives of childrens advocacy and family support, juvenile justice
advocacy, behavioral health, housing support and homelessness prevention, and early
childhood supports and education organizations, an organization providing
support for family financial security, business and commerce, the faith-based
community, a community leader, and parents or guardians whose children are
receiving State funded services;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     (3)   two
public members appointed by the Senate President, one of whom shall be a
representative of municipal government, and one of whom shall be a resident of
an underserved community; and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     (4)   two
public members appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly, one of whom shall
be a representative of county government, and one of whom shall be a resident
of an underserved community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     c.     Vacancies
in the membership of the council shall be filled in the same manner provided
for the original appointments.  The members of the council shall serve without
compensation, but may be reimbursed for travel and other miscellaneous expenses
necessary to perform their duties, within the limits of funds made available to
the council for these purposes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     d.    The
council shall organize as soon as practicable but no later than 60 days
following the appointment of its members, and shall select two co-chairpersons
from among their members, one of whom shall be a State official and one of whom
shall be a community representative.  The chairpersons shall appoint a
secretary who need not be a member of the council.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     e.     The
council shall meet at the call of its chairpersons, and hold hearings at the
times and in the places it deems appropriate and necessary to fulfill its
