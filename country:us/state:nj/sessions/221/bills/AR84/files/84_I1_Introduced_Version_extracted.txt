The Abraham Accords include agreements with the State of Israel and several Arab League nations, mediated by the United States.  The Abraham Accords are named after the patriarch Abraham, regarded as a prophet by both the religions of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, and traditionally considered a shared patriarch of the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian peoples.  Prior to the accords, only two Arab League nations, the Arab Republic of Egypt in 1979 and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1994, had formally normalized relations with Israel. Since September 2020, four new nations, the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Kingdom of Morocco, and the Republic of the Sudan, have all signed respective peace agreements with Israel.  The agreements formally normalize foreign relations, permit an exchange in ambassadors, and permit cooperation in technology, health, agriculture, and other areas.  The accords are a monumental achievement, recognizing the importance of maintaining and strengthening peace in the Middle East and around the world based on mutual understanding and coexistence, as well as respect for human dignity and freedom, including religious freedom.
