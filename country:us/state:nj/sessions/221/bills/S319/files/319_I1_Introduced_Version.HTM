(2)   the levels and duration of treatment provided to patients, including the time patients spend in each level, phase, or program included in a course of treatment; (3)   the number of patients referred to other treatment providers and the reasons for those referrals, including whether referrals were made based on available capacity, the level of treatment available from a given provider, or other reasons; (4)   the number of patients who complete their course of treatment; (5)   the number of patients who do not complete their course of treatment, and the reason why each patient did not complete treatment, if known; (6)   relapse and long-term recovery rates for patients after leaving treatment, which may incorporate voluntary patient reporting; and (7)   any other data or metrics the office deems necessary and appropriate. c.     (1)  The office shall require treatment providers to regularly update the centralized database with current information concerning the providers available treatment services and resources.  The information reported by treatment providers shall include the providers current number of open treatment spots, the level of treatment available in each spot, the number of patients currently awaiting treatment through the provider, and the number of treatment spots that the provider reasonably anticipates will become available within the next 24 hours, including the anticipated level of treatment available in each spot.  Each provider shall update this information at least once every 12 hours, and at more frequent intervals if the office determines that more frequent or real-time reporting is feasible and appropriate. (2)   The office shall provide access to the information included in the centralized database pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection to all treatment providers and to any agencies, offices, or other entities that serve as a contact point for patients seeking treatment for an alcohol use disorder or a drug use disorder, for the purpose of referring patients to available and appropriate treatment. d.    The office shall collaborate with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Health to include in the centralized database data concerning the number, location, and types of interventions performed throughout the State to treat drug overdoses, and in particular overdoses involving opioid drugs, in order to identify patterns in overdose incidents, coordinate outreach efforts in the affected communities, and determine and direct the Statewide allocation of funding and resources for the treatment of drug use disorders. e.     The office shall utilize the data reported to the centralized database to determine appropriate allocations of funding and resources available to the various State, county, and local departments, divisions, offices, agencies, and treatment providers to determine the most effective use of those funds and resources.  The offices findings and recommendations shall be included in the Comprehensive Statewide Alcohol Use Disorders and Drug Use Disorders Master Plan submitted to the Governor and to the Legislature pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). f.     The office shall utilize the data reported to the centralized database to develop best practices guidelines and performance benchmarks for treatment providers.  The office, in its discretion, may establish a program to provide financial or other incentives to treatment providers who achieve certain performance benchmarks in such areas as the office determines appropriate to drive improvements in the provision of treatment for alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders, including, but not limited to, achieving specified goals with regard to patient wait times, patient retention rates, patient progression through a course of treatment, the number and rate of patients who complete treatment, and other specific patient outcomes.  The office shall periodically review and revise any incentive program established pursuant to this section to maintain the integrity of the incentive program, to ensure the incentive program is achieving improvements in patient care, to review and revise the benchmarks as needed to better achieve the intended outcomes and goals, and to revise or eliminate any aspects of an incentive program that may result in adverse unintended consequences in the provision of treatment to patients. g.    The office shall utilize the data reported to the centralized database and consult with treatment providers and appropriate State, county, and local agencies to identify barriers that reduce the ability of patients to access appropriate services and resources for the treatment of alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders. The office shall develop appropriate responses to address or remove barriers to access, which may include: programs to provide transportation assistance, child care assistance, or home visits; working with health benefits carriers to secure coverage for all appropriate treatment modalities and services related to treatment; and working with treatment providers to promote flexible scheduling and expanded hours, and to encourage and support providers in becoming authorized to prescribe and administer medication-assisted treatment. h.    For the purposes of establishing and maintaining a centralized database pursuant to this section, the office may utilize, modify, or adapt any existing systems that provide functions related to, or that would supplement, the functions and purpose of the centralized database, including, but not limited to, the database established pursuant to P.L.2015, c.293 (C.26:2G-25.1 et seq.), the data dashboard report developed pursuant to P.L.2017, c.155 (C.30:4-177.66 et seq.), and nonidentifying prescription monitoring information furnished to the office by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety pursuant to subsection m. of section 26 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-46).  The office shall be authorized to contract with an independent third party to establish and maintain the centralized database pursuant to this section. i.     To the extent that the centralized database includes any personal identifying information or any confidential health information concerning any patient, such information shall not be disclosed to any entity except as may be required pursuant to State or federal law.  The office shall seek to avoid requiring any personal identifying information or confidential health information to be reported to, or included in, the centralized database, except as may be necessary and consistent with the purposes of P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). j.     The office shall make available to the public through its Internet website current data concerning the provision of treatment for alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders in the State, including:  patient wait times; treatment program completion rates; reasons for non-completion of treatment; the level and nature of treatment modalities provided and the average duration of each phase of treatment; long-term recovery rates; remission and overdose rates; the number of patient referrals made by treatment providers to another provider, and the reasons for those referrals; and any other information the office deems appropriate. 4.    (New section)  a.  The Office of Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Policy shall develop standards, policies, and procedures to support the various departments, divisions, agencies, offices, and other entities that enter into contracts with treatment providers in order to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and any applicable State or federal laws, regulations, and requirements, including, but not limited to: (1)   ensuring that treatment providers are meeting all requirements for payment under the contract; (2)   ensuring providers are compliant with all applicable criminal history record background check requirements and drug testing requirements for provider staff; and (3)   ensuring prompt reconciliation of any claims for payment, including promptly closing out contracts, processing claims for payment, and collecting receivables and any other amounts owed to the department, division, agency, office, or entity. b.    The office may designate a compliance officer, who shall be authorized to retain appropriate staff to provide support services to the various departments, divisions, agencies, offices, and other entities for the purposes of this section. 5.    (New section)  As used in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.    , c.

(2)   A person being sentenced for more than one offense set forth in subsection a. of this section who is not placed in supervisory treatment pursuant to this section or ordered to perform reformative service pursuant to subsection f. of this section may, in the discretion of the court, be assessed a single penalty applicable to the highest degree offense for which the person is convicted, if the court finds that the defendant has established the following: (a)   the imposition of multiple penalties would constitute a serious hardship that outweighs the need to deter the defendant from future criminal activity; and (b)   the imposition of a single penalty would foster the defendant's rehabilitation. Every person placed in supervisory treatment pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.2C:36A-1 or N.J.S.2C:43-12 for a violation of any offense defined in this chapter or chapter 36 of this title shall be assessed the penalty prescribed in this section and applicable to the degree of the offense charged, except that the court shall not impose more than one such penalty regardless of the number of offenses charged.  If the person is charged with more than one offense, the court shall impose as a condition of supervisory treatment the penalty applicable to the highest degree offense for which the person is charged. All penalties provided for in this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any fine authorized by law or required to be imposed pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.2C:35-12. b.    All penalties provided for in this section shall be collected as provided for collection of fines and restitutions in section 3 of P.L.1979, c.396 (C.2C:46-4), and shall be forwarded to the Department of the Treasury as provided in subsection c. of this section. c.     All moneys collected pursuant to this section shall be forwarded to the Department of the Treasury to be deposited in a nonlapsing revolving fund to be known as the "Drug Enforcement and Demand Reduction Fund."  Moneys in the fund shall be appropriated by the Legislature on an annual basis for the purposes of funding in the following order of priority: (1) the Alliance to Prevent [Alcoholism and Drug Abuse] Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders and its administration by the [Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse] Office of Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Policy; (2) the "Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Program for the Deaf, Hard of Hearing and Disabled" established pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1995, c.318 (C.26:2B-37); (3) the "Partnership for a Drug Free New Jersey," the State affiliate of the "Partnership for a Drug Free America"; and (4) other alcohol and drug [abuse] use disorder programs. Moneys appropriated for the purpose of funding the "Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Program for the Deaf, Hard of Hearing and Disabled" shall not be used to supplant moneys that are available to the Department of Health and Senior Services as of the effective date of P.L.1995, c.318 (C.26:2B-36 et al.), and that would otherwise have been made available to provide alcoholism and drug abuse services for the deaf, hard of hearing and disabled, nor shall the moneys be used for the administrative costs of the program. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1991, c.329). e.     The court may suspend the collection of a penalty imposed pursuant to this section; provided the person is ordered by the court to participate in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program approved by the court; and further provided that the person agrees to pay for all or some portion of the costs associated with the rehabilitation program.  In this case, the collection of a penalty imposed pursuant to this section shall be suspended during the person's participation in the approved, court-ordered rehabilitation program.  Upon successful completion of the program, as determined by the court upon the recommendation of the treatment provider, the person may apply to the court to reduce the penalty imposed pursuant to this section by any amount actually paid by the person for participating in the program.  The court shall not reduce the penalty pursuant to this subsection unless the person establishes to the satisfaction of the court that the person has successfully completed the rehabilitation program.  If the person's participation is for any reason terminated before successful completion of the rehabilitation program, collection of the entire penalty imposed pursuant to this section shall be enforced.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect or suspend any other criminal sanctions imposed pursuant to this chapter or chapter 36 of this title. f.     A person required to pay a penalty under this section may propose to the court and the prosecutor a plan to perform reformative service in lieu of payment of up to one-half of the penalty amount imposed under this section.  The reformative service plan option shall not be available if the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section apply or if the person is placed in supervisory treatment pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.2C:36A-1 or N.J.S.2C:43-12.  For purposes of this section, "reformative service" shall include training, education or work, in which regular attendance and participation is required, supervised, and recorded, and which would assist in the defendant's rehabilitation and reintegration.  "Reformative service" shall include, but not be limited to, substance abuse treatment or services, other therapeutic treatment, educational or vocational services, employment training or services, family counseling, service to the community and volunteer work.  For the purposes of this section, an application to participate in a court-administered alcohol and drug rehabilitation program shall have the same effect as the submission of a reformative service plan to the court. The court, in its discretion, shall determine whether to accept the plan, after considering the position of the prosecutor, the plan's appropriateness and practicality, the defendant's ability to pay, and the effect of the proposed service on the defendant's rehabilitation and reintegration into society.  The court shall determine the amount of the credit that would be applied against the penalty upon successful completion of the reformative service, not to exceed one-half of the amount assessed, except that the court may, in the case of an extreme financial hardship, waive additional amounts of the penalty owed by a person who has completed a court administered alcohol and drug rehabilitation program if necessary to aid the person's rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court shall not apply the credit against the penalty unless the person establishes to the satisfaction of the court that the person has successfully completed the reformative service.  If the person's participation is for any reason terminated before his successful completion of the reformative service, collection of the entire penalty imposed pursuant to this section shall be enforced.  Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to affect or suspend any other criminal sanctions imposed pursuant to this chapter or chapter 36 of this title. Any reformative service ordered pursuant to this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any community service imposed by the court or otherwise required by law.  Nothing in this section shall limit the court's authority to order a person to participate in any activity, program, or treatment in addition to those proposed in a reformative service plan. (cf: P.L.2019, c.363, s.4) 7.    Section 4 of P.L.1983, c.531 (C.26:2B-33) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a.  The governing body of each county, in conjunction with the county agency or individual designated by the county with the responsibility for planning services and programs for the care or rehabilitation of persons with alcohol use [disorder] disorders and persons with [a substance] drug use [disorder involving drugs] disorders, shall submit to the Office of Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Policy, the [Deputy] Assistant Commissioner for the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services, and the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse an annual comprehensive plan for the provision of community services to meet the needs of persons with alcohol use [disorder] disorders and persons with [a substance] drug use [disorder involving drugs] disorders. b.    The annual comprehensive plan shall address the needs of urban areas with a population of 100,000 or over and shall demonstrate linkage with existing resources which serve persons with alcohol use [disorder] disorders and persons with [a substance] drug use [disorder] disorders and their families.  Special attention in the plan shall be given to alcohol use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders and youth; intoxicated drivers and drivers with [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders; women and alcohol use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders; persons with disabilities and alcohol use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders; alcohol use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders on the job; alcohol use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders and crime; public information; and educational programs as defined in subsection c. of this section.  Each county shall identify, within its annual comprehensive plan, the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center which shall service its population, as is required under subsection (f) of R.S.39:4-50.  The plan may involve the provision of programs and services by the county, by an agreement with a State agency, by private organizations, including volunteer groups, or by some specified combination of the above.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.131, s.94) 13.  R.S.39:4-50 is amended to read as follows: 39:4-50.  (a)  A person who operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, narcotic, hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug, or operates a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or more by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood or permits another person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, narcotic, hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug to operate a motor vehicle the person owns or which is in the person's custody or control or permits another to operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or more by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood shall be subject: (1)   For the first offense: (i)    if the person's blood alcohol concentration is 0.08% or higher but less than 0.10%, or the person operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, or the person permits another person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor to operate a motor vehicle owned by him or in his custody or control or permits another person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or higher but less than 0.10% to operate a motor vehicle, to a fine of not less than $250 nor more than $400 and a period of detainment of not less than 12 hours nor more than 48 hours spent during two consecutive days of not less than six hours each day and served as prescribed by the program requirements of the Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers established under subsection (f) of this section and, in the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment of not more than 30 days.

After the expiration of the license forfeiture period, the person may make application to the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission for a license to operate a motor vehicle, which application may be granted at the discretion of the chief administrator, consistent with subsection (b) of this section.  For a second violation, a person also shall be required to install an ignition interlock device under the provisions of P.L.1999, c.417 (C.39:4-50.16 et al.). (3)   For a third or subsequent violation, a person shall be subject to a fine of $1,000, and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than 180 days in a county jail or workhouse, except that the court may lower such term for each day, not exceeding 90 days, served participating in a drug or alcohol inpatient rehabilitation program approved by the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center and shall thereafter forfeit the right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for eight years. For a third or subsequent violation, a person also shall be required to install an ignition interlock device under the provisions of P.L.1999, c.417 (C.39:4-50.16 et al.). As used in this section, the phrase "narcotic, hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug" includes an inhalant or other substance containing a chemical capable of releasing any toxic vapors or fumes for the purpose of inducing a condition of intoxication, such as any glue, cement or any other substance containing one or more of the following chemical compounds: acetone and acetate, amyl nitrite or amyl nitrate or their isomers, benzene, butyl alcohol, butyl nitrite, butyl nitrate or their isomers, ethyl acetate, ethyl alcohol, ethyl nitrite or ethyl nitrate, ethylene dichloride, isobutyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, methyl ethyl ketone, nitrous oxide, n-propyl alcohol, [pentachlorophenol] phencyclidine, petroleum ether, propyl nitrite or propyl nitrate or their isomers, toluene, toluol or xylene or any other chemical substance capable of causing a condition of intoxication, inebriation, excitement, stupefaction or the dulling of the brain or nervous system as a result of the inhalation of the fumes or vapors of such chemical substance. Whenever an operator of a motor vehicle has been involved in an accident resulting in death, bodily injury or property damage, a police officer shall consider that fact along with all other facts and circumstances in determining whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that person was operating a motor vehicle in violation of this section. A conviction of a violation of a law of a substantially similar nature in another jurisdiction, regardless of whether that jurisdiction is a signatory to the Interstate Driver License Compact pursuant to P.L.1966, c.73 (C.39:5D-1 et seq.), shall constitute a prior conviction under this subsection unless the defendant can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the conviction in the other jurisdiction was based exclusively upon a violation of a proscribed blood alcohol concentration of less than 0.08%. If the driving privilege of any person is under revocation or suspension for a violation of any provision of this Title or Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes at the time of any conviction for a violation of this section, the revocation or suspension period imposed shall commence as of the date of termination of the existing revocation or suspension period.  In the case of any person who at the time of the imposition of sentence is less than 17 years of age, the forfeiture, suspension or revocation of the driving privilege imposed by the court under this section shall commence immediately, run through the offender's seventeenth birthday and continue from that date for the period set by the court pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection.  A court that imposes a term of imprisonment for a first or second offense under this section may sentence the person so convicted to the county jail, to the workhouse of the county wherein the offense was committed, to an inpatient rehabilitation program or to an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center or other facility approved by the chief of the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit in the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the Department of [Health] Human Services.  For a third or subsequent offense a person shall not serve a term of imprisonment at an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center as provided in subsection (f). A person who has been convicted of a previous violation of this section need not be charged as a second or subsequent offender in the complaint made against him in order to render him liable to the punishment imposed by this section on a second or subsequent offender, but if the second offense occurs more than 10 years after the first offense, the court shall treat the second conviction as a first offense for sentencing purposes and if a third offense occurs more than 10 years after the second offense, the court shall treat the third conviction as a second offense for sentencing purposes. (b)   A person convicted under this section must satisfy the screening, evaluation, referral, program and fee requirements of the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services' Intoxicated Driving Program Unit, and of the Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers and a program of alcohol and drug education and highway safety, as prescribed by the chief administrator. The sentencing court shall inform the person convicted that failure to satisfy such requirements shall result in a mandatory two-day term of imprisonment in a county jail and a driver license revocation or suspension and continuation of revocation or suspension until such requirements are satisfied, unless stayed by court order in accordance with the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey, or R.S.39:5-22. Upon sentencing, the court shall forward to the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services' Intoxicated Driving Program Unit a copy of a person's conviction record.  A fee of $100 shall be payable to the Alcohol Education, Rehabilitation and Enforcement Fund established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1983, c.531 (C.26:2B-32) to support the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit. (c)   Upon conviction of a violation of this section, the court shall collect forthwith the New Jersey driver's license or licenses of the person so convicted and forward such license or licenses to the chief administrator.  The court shall inform the person convicted that if he is convicted of personally operating a motor vehicle during the period of license suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, he shall, upon conviction, be subject to the penalties established in R.S.39:3-40. The person convicted shall be informed orally and in writing.  A person shall be required to acknowledge receipt of that written notice in writing. Failure to receive a written notice or failure to acknowledge in writing the receipt of a written notice shall not be a defense to a subsequent charge of a violation of R.S.39:3-40.  In the event that a person convicted under this section is the holder of any out-of-State driver's license, the court shall not collect the license but shall notify forthwith the chief administrator, who shall, in turn, notify appropriate officials in the licensing jurisdiction.  The court shall, however, revoke the nonresident's driving privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this State, in accordance with this section.  Upon conviction of a violation of this section, the court shall notify the person convicted, orally and in writing, of the penalties for a second, third or subsequent violation of this section.  A person shall be required to acknowledge receipt of that written notice in writing. Failure to receive a written notice or failure to acknowledge in writing the receipt of a written notice shall not be a defense to a subsequent charge of a violation of this section. (d)   The chief administrator shall promulgate rules and regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) in order to establish a program of alcohol education and highway safety, as prescribed by [this act] P.L.1977, c.29. (e)   Any person accused of a violation of this section who is liable to punishment imposed by this section as a second or subsequent offender shall be entitled to the same rights of discovery as allowed defendants pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey. (f)   The counties, in cooperation with the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services and the commission, but subject to the approval of the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services, shall designate and establish on a county or regional basis Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers.  These centers shall have the capability of serving as community treatment referral centers and as court monitors of a person's compliance with the ordered treatment, service alternative or community service.  All centers established pursuant to this subsection shall be administered by a counselor certified by the Addiction Professionals Certification Board of New Jersey or other professional with a minimum of five years' experience in the treatment of alcoholism.  All centers shall be required to develop individualized treatment plans for all persons attending the centers; provided that the duration of any ordered treatment or referral shall not exceed one year.  It shall be the center's responsibility to establish networks with the community alcohol and drug education, treatment and rehabilitation resources and to receive monthly reports from the referral agencies regarding a person's participation and compliance with the program. Nothing in this subsection shall bar these centers from developing their own education and treatment programs; provided that they are approved by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services. Upon a person's failure to report to the initial screening or any subsequent ordered referral, the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center shall promptly notify the sentencing court of the person's failure to comply. Required detention periods at the Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers shall be determined according to the individual treatment classification assigned by the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit. Upon attendance at an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center, a person shall be required to pay a per diem fee of $75 for the first offender program or a per diem fee of $100 for the second offender program, as appropriate.  Any increases in the per diem fees after the first full year shall be determined pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the Commissioner of [Health] Human Services in consultation with the [Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse] Office of Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Policy pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). The centers shall conduct a program of alcohol and drug education and highway safety, as prescribed by the chief administrator. The Commissioner of [Health] Human Services shall adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), in order to effectuate the purposes of this subsection. (g)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.248) (h)   A court also may order a person convicted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, to participate in a supervised visitation program as either a condition of probation or a form of community service, giving preference to those who were under the age of 21 at the time of the offense.  Prior to ordering a person to participate in such a program, the court may consult with any person who may provide useful information on the defendant's physical, emotional and mental suitability for the visit to ensure that it will not cause any injury to the defendant.  The court also may order that the defendant participate in a counseling session under the supervision of the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit prior to participating in the supervised visitation program.  The supervised visitation program shall be at one or more of the following facilities which have agreed to participate in the program under the supervision of the facility's personnel and the probation department: (1)   a trauma center, critical care center or acute care hospital having basic emergency services, which receives victims of motor vehicle accidents for the purpose of observing appropriate victims of drunk drivers and victims who are, themselves, drunk drivers; (2)   a facility which cares for patients who have advanced [alcoholics or drug abusers] alcohol or drug use disorders, to observe persons in the advanced stages of [alcoholism or drug abuse] an alcohol or drug use disorder; or (3)   if approved by a county medical examiner, the office of the county medical examiner or a public morgue to observe appropriate victims of vehicle accidents involving drunk drivers. As used in this section, "appropriate victim" means a victim whose condition is determined by the facility's supervisory personnel and the probation officer to be appropriate for demonstrating the results of accidents involving drunk drivers without being unnecessarily gruesome or traumatic to the defendant. If at any time before or during a visitation the facility's supervisory personnel and the probation officer determine that the visitation may be or is traumatic or otherwise inappropriate for that defendant, the visitation shall be terminated without prejudice to the defendant.  The program may include a personal conference after the visitation, which may include the sentencing judge or the judge who coordinates the program for the court, the defendant, defendant's counsel, and, if available, the defendant's parents to discuss the visitation and its effect on the defendant's future conduct.  If a personal conference is not practicable because of the defendant's absence from the jurisdiction, conflicting time schedules, or any other reason, the court shall require the defendant to submit a written report concerning the visitation experience and its impact on the defendant.  The county, a court, any facility visited pursuant to the program, any agents, employees, or independent contractors of the court, county, or facility visited pursuant to the program, and any person supervising a defendant during the visitation, are not liable for any civil damages resulting from injury to the defendant, or for civil damages associated with the visitation which are caused by the defendant, except for willful or grossly negligent acts intended to, or reasonably expected to result in, that injury or damage. The Supreme Court may adopt court rules or directives to effectuate the purposes of this subsection. (i)    In addition to any other fine, fee, or other charge imposed pursuant to law, the court shall assess a person convicted of a violation of the provisions of this section a surcharge of $125, of which amount $50 shall be payable to the municipality in which the conviction was obtained, $50 shall be payable to the Treasurer of the State of New Jersey for deposit into the General Fund, and $25 which shall be payable as follows: in a matter where the summons was issued by a municipality's law enforcement agency, to that municipality to be used for the cost of equipping police vehicles with mobile video recording systems pursuant to the provisions of section 1 of P.L.2014, c.54 (C.40A:14-118.1); in a matter where the summons was issued by a county's law enforcement agency, to that county; and in a matter where the summons was issued by a State law enforcement agency, to the General Fund. (cf: P.L.2019, c.248, s.2) 14.  Section 26 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-46) is amended to read as follows: 26.  Access to prescription information. a.     The division shall maintain procedures to ensure privacy and confidentiality of patients and that patient information collected, recorded, transmitted, and maintained is not disclosed, except as permitted in this section, including, but not limited to, the use of a password-protected system for maintaining this information and permitting access thereto as authorized under sections 25 through 30 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-45 through C.45:1-50), and a requirement that a person as listed in subsection h. or i. of this section provide affirmation of the person's intent to comply with the provisions of sections 25 through 30 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-45 through C.45:1-50) as a condition of accessing the information. b.    The prescription monitoring information submitted to the division shall be confidential and not be subject to public disclosure under P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), or P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5 et al.). c.     The division shall review the prescription monitoring information provided by a pharmacy permit holder pursuant to sections 25 through 30 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-45 through C.45:1-50).  The review shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   a review to identify whether any person is obtaining a prescription in a manner that may be indicative of misuse, abuse, or diversion of a controlled dangerous substance.  The director shall establish guidelines regarding the terms "misuse," "abuse," and "diversion" for the purposes of this review.  When an evaluation of the information indicates that a person may be obtaining a prescription for the same or a similar controlled dangerous substance from multiple practitioners or pharmacists during the same time period, the division may provide prescription monitoring information about the person to practitioners and pharmacists; and (2)   a review to identify whether a violation of law or regulation or a breach of the applicable standards of practice by any person may have occurred, including, but not limited to, diversion of a controlled dangerous substance.  If the division determines that such a violation or breach may have occurred, the division shall notify the appropriate law enforcement agency or professional licensing board, and provide the prescription monitoring information required for an investigation. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2015, c.74) e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2015, c.74) f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2015, c.74) g.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2015, c.74) h.

STATEMENT This bill establishes the Office of Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Policy (Office).  The Office will be responsible for reviewing and coordinating all State departments' efforts with regard to the planning and provision of treatment, prevention, research, evaluation, and education services for, and public awareness of, alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders.  The Office will serve strategic planning, advisory, coordination, communication, and development functions in order to coordinate Statewide efforts and drive improvements in the prevention of, and provision of treatment for, alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders.  The Office will be allocated within the Department of the Treasury but will be independent of the department and will report directly to the Governor. The duties of the Office will include developing a Comprehensive Statewide Alcohol Use Disorders and Drug Use Disorders Master Plan, to be submitted to the Governor and the Legislature by July 1 of each year, for the treatment, prevention, research, evaluation, education, and public awareness of alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders.  The plan is to:  incorporate and unify all State, county, local, and private alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders initiatives; include an emphasis on prevention, community awareness, and family and youth services; and include recommendations for funding allocations. The Office will be required to review County Annual Alliance Plans and propose recommendations for awarding Alliance grants, and will additionally be responsible for distributing certain grants to counties and municipalities for alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders programs and evaluating the existing funding mechanisms for treatment services for alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders. The Office will be required to encourage the development or expansion of employee assistance programs for both government and private sector employees. The Office will be authorized to call upon any department, office, division, agency, or independent authority of State government to provide such information, resources, or other assistance as may be necessary to discharge the duties and functions of the Office and fulfill its responsibilities.  The Office may collect from any State, county, local governmental entity, or any other appropriate source data, reports, statistics, or other materials which are necessary to carry out the functions of the Office. The executive director of the Office will be required to convene a meeting, on at least an annual basis and at such additional intervals as the executive director of the office deems necessary, to be attended by the Attorney General, the Commissioner of Health, the Commissioner of Human Services, the Commissioner of Education, the Commissioner of Corrections, the Commissioner of Children and Families, the Commissioner of Community Affairs, the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, the Assistant Commissioner for the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Assistant Commissioner for the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, the Assistant Commissioner for the Childrens System of Care, and other appropriate agencies, officers, and entities, in order to plan, develop, and coordinate State and local efforts to improve the prevention of, and the provision of treatment for, alcohol and drug use disorders. The Office will be administered by an executive director, who will be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.  The executive director is to be a person qualified by education, training, and experience to perform the duties of the office.  The executive director will serve at the pleasure of the Governor during the Governor's term of office and until the appointment and qualification of the executive director's successor.  The executive director will have the power to employ staff within the limits of funds appropriated or made available for that purpose, and will have broad authority to coordinate communication between, and request and receive information from, any department, division, or agency of the State.  The executive director will be required to devote full time to the duties and responsibilities of the office, and will receive a salary as provided by law. The Office will be required to develop and maintain a centralized Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Treatment Resource Database that can be used to track Statewide treatment data, direct resources, develop recommendations regarding the allocation of funding and resources, facilitate referrals to available treatment resources, and evaluate provider performance.  Specifically, treatment providers will be required to report certain data concerning patient wait times, the levels and duration of treatment provided to patients, the number of patients referred to other treatment providers and the reasons for those referrals, treatment completion rates, relapse and long-term recovery rates, and any other data or metrics the Office deems necessary and appropriate.  The Office will use this data to evaluate provider performance as well as to develop best practices guidelines and performance benchmarks. Additionally, treatment providers will be required update the database to indicate the availability of treatment spots at the provider, including the level of treatment available in each spot, the number of patients awaiting treatment, and the providers anticipated treatment availability in the next 24 hours.  Providers will be required to update this information at least once every 12 hours, and at more frequent intervals if the Office determines that more frequent or real-time reporting is feasible and appropriate.  Treatment providers and agencies, offices, and other entities that serve as a contact point for patients seeking treatment will have access to the treatment availability information in the database for the purpose of referring patients to treatment. The Office will be required to collaborate with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Health to include in the centralized database data concerning the number, location, and types of interventions performed throughout the State to treat drug overdoses, and in particular overdoses involving opioid drugs, in order to identify patterns in overdose incidents, coordinate outreach efforts in the affected communities, and determine and direct the Statewide allocation of funding and resources for the treatment of drug use disorders. The Office will be authorized to establish programs providing financial and other incentives to treatment providers who achieve certain performance benchmarks established by the Office to drive improvements in the treatment of alcohol and drug use disorders. Benchmark goals may address patient wait times, patient retention, patient progression through a course of treatment, and the number and rate of patients who complete treatment.  The Office will be required to periodically review and revise any incentive programs it establishes in order to maintain the integrity of the program, ensure the program is realizing improvements in patient care, modify benchmarks as needed, and revise or eliminate any aspects of a program that may result in adverse unintended consequences. The Office is to utilize the database and consult with treatment providers and appropriate State, county, and local agencies to identify barriers that reduce the ability of patients to access appropriate treatment services.  The Office is to develop appropriate responses to address or remove barriers to access, which may include: developing programs to provide transportation assistance, child care assistance, or home visits; working with health benefits carriers to secure coverage for all appropriate treatment modalities and services related to treatment; and working with treatment providers to promote flexible scheduling and expanded hours, and encourage and support providers to become authorized to prescribe and administer medication-assisted treatment. For the purposes of establishing and maintaining a centralized database, the Office will be permitted to utilize, modify, or adapt any existing systems that provide functions related to, or that would supplement, the functions and purpose of the centralized database.  The Office will also be authorized to contract with an independent third party to establish and maintain the database. The bill provides that, to the extent that the centralized database includes any personal identifying information or any confidential health information concerning any patient, such information may not be disclosed to any entity except as may be required pursuant to State or federal law.  The Office is to seek to avoid requiring any personal identifying information or confidential health information to be reported to, or included in, the database. The Office will be required to make available to the public, through its Internet website, certain data concerning the provision of treatment for alcohol and drug use disorders, including:  patient wait times; treatment program completion rates; reasons for non-completion of treatment; the level and nature of treatment modalities provided and the average duration of each phase of treatment; long-term recovery rates; remission and overdose rates; patient referrals made by treatment providers to other providers; and any other information the office deems appropriate. The Office will be required to develop standards, policies, and procedures to support the various departments, divisions, agencies, offices, and other entities that enter into contracts with treatment providers to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and any applicable State or federal laws, regulations, and requirements, including: ensuring that any requirements for payment under the contract are met; ensuring providers are complying with all applicable criminal history record background check and drug testing requirements for provider staff; and ensuring prompt reconciliation of any claims for payment, including promptly closing out contracts, processing claims, and collecting receivables and other amounts owed.  For this purpose, the Office will be authorized to designate a compliance officer, who may retain appropriate staff to provide support services to the various departments, divisions, agencies, offices, and other entities. The bill revises various provisions of the current statutory law to update references to include the Office and to transfer certain functions of the Governors Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse to the Office.

The office shall develop appropriate responses to address or remove barriers to access, which may include: programs to provide transportation assistance, child care assistance, or home visits; working with health benefits carriers to secure coverage for all appropriate treatment modalities and services related to treatment; and working with treatment providers to promote flexible scheduling and expanded hours, and to encourage and support providers in becoming authorized to prescribe and administer medication-assisted treatment. h.    For the purposes of establishing and maintaining a centralized database pursuant to this section, the office may utilize, modify, or adapt any existing systems that provide functions related to, or that would supplement, the functions and purpose of the centralized database, including, but not limited to, the database established pursuant to P.L.2015, c.293 (C.26:2G-25.1 et seq.), the data dashboard report developed pursuant to P.L.2017, c.155 (C.30:4-177.66 et seq.), and nonidentifying prescription monitoring information furnished to the office by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety pursuant to subsection m. of section 26 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-46).  The office shall be authorized to contract with an independent third party to establish and maintain the centralized database pursuant to this section. i.     To the extent that the centralized database includes any personal identifying information or any confidential health information concerning any patient, such information shall not be disclosed to any entity except as may be required pursuant to State or federal law.  The office shall seek to avoid requiring any personal identifying information or confidential health information to be reported to, or included in, the centralized database, except as may be necessary and consistent with the purposes of P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). j.     The office shall make available to the public through its Internet website current data concerning the provision of treatment for alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders in the State, including:  patient wait times; treatment program completion rates; reasons for non-completion of treatment; the level and nature of treatment modalities provided and the average duration of each phase of treatment; long-term recovery rates; remission and overdose rates; the number of patient referrals made by treatment providers to another provider, and the reasons for those referrals; and any other information the office deems appropriate. 4.    (New section)  a.  The Office of Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Policy shall develop standards, policies, and procedures to support the various departments, divisions, agencies, offices, and other entities that enter into contracts with treatment providers in order to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and any applicable State or federal laws, regulations, and requirements, including, but not limited to: (1)   ensuring that treatment providers are meeting all requirements for payment under the contract; (2)   ensuring providers are compliant with all applicable criminal history record background check requirements and drug testing requirements for provider staff; and (3)   ensuring prompt reconciliation of any claims for payment, including promptly closing out contracts, processing claims for payment, and collecting receivables and any other amounts owed to the department, division, agency, office, or entity. b.    The office may designate a compliance officer, who shall be authorized to retain appropriate staff to provide support services to the various departments, divisions, agencies, offices, and other entities for the purposes of this section. 5.    (New section)  As used in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), treatment provider means any entity that: receives State, county, or local funding; and is licensed or otherwise authorized by the Department of Health, or by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the Department of Human Services, to provide treatment, care, or related services to persons with alcohol use disorders or drug use disorders. 6.    N.J.S.2C:35-15 is amended to read as follows: 2C:35-15.  a.  (1)  In addition to any disposition authorized by this title, every person convicted of a violation of any offense defined in this chapter or chapter 36 of this title shall be assessed for each offense a penalty fixed at: (a)   $3,000 in the case of a crime of the first degree; (b)   $2,000 in the case of a crime of the second degree; (c)   $1,000 in the case of a crime of the third degree; (d)   $750 in the case of a crime of the fourth degree; (e)   $500 in the case of a disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offense. (2)   A person being sentenced for more than one offense set forth in subsection a. of this section who is not placed in supervisory treatment pursuant to this section or ordered to perform reformative service pursuant to subsection f. of this section may, in the discretion of the court, be assessed a single penalty applicable to the highest degree offense for which the person is convicted, if the court finds that the defendant has established the following: (a)   the imposition of multiple penalties would constitute a serious hardship that outweighs the need to deter the defendant from future criminal activity; and (b)   the imposition of a single penalty would foster the defendant's rehabilitation. Every person placed in supervisory treatment pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.2C:36A-1 or N.J.S.2C:43-12 for a violation of any offense defined in this chapter or chapter 36 of this title shall be assessed the penalty prescribed in this section and applicable to the degree of the offense charged, except that the court shall not impose more than one such penalty regardless of the number of offenses charged.  If the person is charged with more than one offense, the court shall impose as a condition of supervisory treatment the penalty applicable to the highest degree offense for which the person is charged. All penalties provided for in this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any fine authorized by law or required to be imposed pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.2C:35-12. b.    All penalties provided for in this section shall be collected as provided for collection of fines and restitutions in section 3 of P.L.1979, c.396 (C.2C:46-4), and shall be forwarded to the Department of the Treasury as provided in subsection c. of this section. c.     All moneys collected pursuant to this section shall be forwarded to the Department of the Treasury to be deposited in a nonlapsing revolving fund to be known as the "Drug Enforcement and Demand Reduction Fund."  Moneys in the fund shall be appropriated by the Legislature on an annual basis for the purposes of funding in the following order of priority: (1) the Alliance to Prevent [Alcoholism and Drug Abuse] Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders and its administration by the [Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse] Office of Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Policy; (2) the "Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Program for the Deaf, Hard of Hearing and Disabled" established pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1995, c.318 (C.26:2B-37); (3) the "Partnership for a Drug Free New Jersey," the State affiliate of the "Partnership for a Drug Free America"; and (4) other alcohol and drug [abuse] use disorder programs. Moneys appropriated for the purpose of funding the "Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Program for the Deaf, Hard of Hearing and Disabled" shall not be used to supplant moneys that are available to the Department of Health and Senior Services as of the effective date of P.L.1995, c.318 (C.26:2B-36 et al.), and that would otherwise have been made available to provide alcoholism and drug abuse services for the deaf, hard of hearing and disabled, nor shall the moneys be used for the administrative costs of the program. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1991, c.329). e.     The court may suspend the collection of a penalty imposed pursuant to this section; provided the person is ordered by the court to participate in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program approved by the court; and further provided that the person agrees to pay for all or some portion of the costs associated with the rehabilitation program.  In this case, the collection of a penalty imposed pursuant to this section shall be suspended during the person's participation in the approved, court-ordered rehabilitation program.  Upon successful completion of the program, as determined by the court upon the recommendation of the treatment provider, the person may apply to the court to reduce the penalty imposed pursuant to this section by any amount actually paid by the person for participating in the program.  The court shall not reduce the penalty pursuant to this subsection unless the person establishes to the satisfaction of the court that the person has successfully completed the rehabilitation program.  If the person's participation is for any reason terminated before successful completion of the rehabilitation program, collection of the entire penalty imposed pursuant to this section shall be enforced.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect or suspend any other criminal sanctions imposed pursuant to this chapter or chapter 36 of this title. f.     A person required to pay a penalty under this section may propose to the court and the prosecutor a plan to perform reformative service in lieu of payment of up to one-half of the penalty amount imposed under this section.  The reformative service plan option shall not be available if the provisions of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section apply or if the person is placed in supervisory treatment pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.2C:36A-1 or N.J.S.2C:43-12.  For purposes of this section, "reformative service" shall include training, education or work, in which regular attendance and participation is required, supervised, and recorded, and which would assist in the defendant's rehabilitation and reintegration.  "Reformative service" shall include, but not be limited to, substance abuse treatment or services, other therapeutic treatment, educational or vocational services, employment training or services, family counseling, service to the community and volunteer work.  For the purposes of this section, an application to participate in a court-administered alcohol and drug rehabilitation program shall have the same effect as the submission of a reformative service plan to the court. The court, in its discretion, shall determine whether to accept the plan, after considering the position of the prosecutor, the plan's appropriateness and practicality, the defendant's ability to pay, and the effect of the proposed service on the defendant's rehabilitation and reintegration into society.  The court shall determine the amount of the credit that would be applied against the penalty upon successful completion of the reformative service, not to exceed one-half of the amount assessed, except that the court may, in the case of an extreme financial hardship, waive additional amounts of the penalty owed by a person who has completed a court administered alcohol and drug rehabilitation program if necessary to aid the person's rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court shall not apply the credit against the penalty unless the person establishes to the satisfaction of the court that the person has successfully completed the reformative service.  If the person's participation is for any reason terminated before his successful completion of the reformative service, collection of the entire penalty imposed pursuant to this section shall be enforced.  Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to affect or suspend any other criminal sanctions imposed pursuant to this chapter or chapter 36 of this title. Any reformative service ordered pursuant to this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any community service imposed by the court or otherwise required by law.  Nothing in this section shall limit the court's authority to order a person to participate in any activity, program, or treatment in addition to those proposed in a reformative service plan. (cf: P.L.2019, c.363, s.4) 7.    Section 4 of P.L.1983, c.531 (C.26:2B-33) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a.  The governing body of each county, in conjunction with the county agency or individual designated by the county with the responsibility for planning services and programs for the care or rehabilitation of persons with alcohol use [disorder] disorders and persons with [a substance] drug use [disorder involving drugs] disorders, shall submit to the Office of Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Policy, the [Deputy] Assistant Commissioner for the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services, and the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse an annual comprehensive plan for the provision of community services to meet the needs of persons with alcohol use [disorder] disorders and persons with [a substance] drug use [disorder involving drugs] disorders. b.    The annual comprehensive plan shall address the needs of urban areas with a population of 100,000 or over and shall demonstrate linkage with existing resources which serve persons with alcohol use [disorder] disorders and persons with [a substance] drug use [disorder] disorders and their families.  Special attention in the plan shall be given to alcohol use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders and youth; intoxicated drivers and drivers with [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders; women and alcohol use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders; persons with disabilities and alcohol use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders; alcohol use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders on the job; alcohol use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders and crime; public information; and educational programs as defined in subsection c. of this section.  Each county shall identify, within its annual comprehensive plan, the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center which shall service its population, as is required under subsection (f) of R.S.39:4-50.  The plan may involve the provision of programs and services by the county, by an agreement with a State agency, by private organizations, including volunteer groups, or by some specified combination of the above.

These funds shall not replace any funds being currently spent on education and training by the county. d.    The governing body of each county, in conjunction with the county agency, or individual, designated by the county with responsibility for services and programs for the care or rehabilitation of persons with alcohol use [disorder] disorders and persons with [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders, shall establish a Local Advisory Committee on Alcohol Use [Disorder] Disorders and [Substance] Drug Use [Disorder] Disorders to assist the governing body in development of the annual comprehensive plan. The advisory committee shall consist of no less than 10 nor more than 16 members and shall be appointed by the governing body.  At least two of the members shall be persons recovering from alcohol use [disorder] disorders and at least two of the members shall be persons recovering from [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders. The committee shall include the county prosecutor or his designee, a wide range of public and private organizations involved in the treatment of alcohol use disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders-related problems and other individuals with interest or experience in issues concerning alcohol [substance] use [disorder] disorders and [substance] drug use [disorder] disorders.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.131, s.94) 13.  R.S.39:4-50 is amended to read as follows: 39:4-50.  (a)  A person who operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, narcotic, hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug, or operates a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or more by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood or permits another person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, narcotic, hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug to operate a motor vehicle the person owns or which is in the person's custody or control or permits another to operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or more by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood shall be subject: (1)   For the first offense: (i)    if the person's blood alcohol concentration is 0.08% or higher but less than 0.10%, or the person operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, or the person permits another person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor to operate a motor vehicle owned by him or in his custody or control or permits another person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08% or higher but less than 0.10% to operate a motor vehicle, to a fine of not less than $250 nor more than $400 and a period of detainment of not less than 12 hours nor more than 48 hours spent during two consecutive days of not less than six hours each day and served as prescribed by the program requirements of the Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers established under subsection (f) of this section and, in the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment of not more than 30 days. In addition, the court shall order the person to forfeit the right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State until the person installs an ignition interlock device in one motor vehicle the person owns, leases, or principally operates, whichever the person most often operates, for the purpose of complying with the provisions of P.L.1999, c.417 (C.39:4-50.16 et al.); (ii)   if the person's blood alcohol concentration is 0.10% or higher, or the person operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of a narcotic, hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug, or the person permits another person who is under the influence of a narcotic, hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug to operate a motor vehicle owned by him or in his custody or control, or permits another person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10% or more to operate a motor vehicle, to a fine of not less than $300 nor more than $500 and a period of detainment of not less than 12 hours nor more than 48 hours spent during two consecutive days of not less than six hours each day and served as prescribed by the program requirements of the Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers established under subsection (f) of this section and, in the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment of not more than 30 days; in the case of a person who is convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of a narcotic, hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug or permitting another person who is under the influence of a narcotic, hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug to operate a motor vehicle owned by the person or under the person's custody or control, the person shall forfeit the right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for a period of not less than seven months nor more than one year; in the case of a person whose blood alcohol concentration is 0.10% or higher but less than 0.15%, the person shall forfeit the right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State until the person installs an ignition interlock device in one motor vehicle the person owns, leases, or principally operates, whichever the person most often operates, for the purpose of complying with the provisions of P.L.1999, c.417 (C.39:4-50.16 et al.); in the case of a person whose blood alcohol concentration is 0.15% or higher, the person shall forfeit the right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for a period of not less than four months or more than six months following installation of an ignition interlock device in one motor vehicle the person owns, leases, or principally operates, whichever the person most often operates, for the purpose of complying with the provisions of P.L.1999, c.417 (C.39:4-50.16 et al.); (iii)  (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.248) (2)   For a second violation, a person shall be subject to a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000, and shall be ordered by the court to perform community service for a period of 30 days, which shall be of such form and on terms the court shall deem appropriate under the circumstances, and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than 48 consecutive hours, which shall not be suspended or served on probation, or more than 90 days, and shall forfeit the right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for a period of not less than one year or more than two years upon conviction. After the expiration of the license forfeiture period, the person may make application to the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission for a license to operate a motor vehicle, which application may be granted at the discretion of the chief administrator, consistent with subsection (b) of this section.  For a second violation, a person also shall be required to install an ignition interlock device under the provisions of P.L.1999, c.417 (C.39:4-50.16 et al.). (3)   For a third or subsequent violation, a person shall be subject to a fine of $1,000, and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than 180 days in a county jail or workhouse, except that the court may lower such term for each day, not exceeding 90 days, served participating in a drug or alcohol inpatient rehabilitation program approved by the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center and shall thereafter forfeit the right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for eight years. For a third or subsequent violation, a person also shall be required to install an ignition interlock device under the provisions of P.L.1999, c.417 (C.39:4-50.16 et al.). As used in this section, the phrase "narcotic, hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug" includes an inhalant or other substance containing a chemical capable of releasing any toxic vapors or fumes for the purpose of inducing a condition of intoxication, such as any glue, cement or any other substance containing one or more of the following chemical compounds: acetone and acetate, amyl nitrite or amyl nitrate or their isomers, benzene, butyl alcohol, butyl nitrite, butyl nitrate or their isomers, ethyl acetate, ethyl alcohol, ethyl nitrite or ethyl nitrate, ethylene dichloride, isobutyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, methyl ethyl ketone, nitrous oxide, n-propyl alcohol, [pentachlorophenol] phencyclidine, petroleum ether, propyl nitrite or propyl nitrate or their isomers, toluene, toluol or xylene or any other chemical substance capable of causing a condition of intoxication, inebriation, excitement, stupefaction or the dulling of the brain or nervous system as a result of the inhalation of the fumes or vapors of such chemical substance. Whenever an operator of a motor vehicle has been involved in an accident resulting in death, bodily injury or property damage, a police officer shall consider that fact along with all other facts and circumstances in determining whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that person was operating a motor vehicle in violation of this section. A conviction of a violation of a law of a substantially similar nature in another jurisdiction, regardless of whether that jurisdiction is a signatory to the Interstate Driver License Compact pursuant to P.L.1966, c.73 (C.39:5D-1 et seq.), shall constitute a prior conviction under this subsection unless the defendant can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the conviction in the other jurisdiction was based exclusively upon a violation of a proscribed blood alcohol concentration of less than 0.08%. If the driving privilege of any person is under revocation or suspension for a violation of any provision of this Title or Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes at the time of any conviction for a violation of this section, the revocation or suspension period imposed shall commence as of the date of termination of the existing revocation or suspension period.  In the case of any person who at the time of the imposition of sentence is less than 17 years of age, the forfeiture, suspension or revocation of the driving privilege imposed by the court under this section shall commence immediately, run through the offender's seventeenth birthday and continue from that date for the period set by the court pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection.  A court that imposes a term of imprisonment for a first or second offense under this section may sentence the person so convicted to the county jail, to the workhouse of the county wherein the offense was committed, to an inpatient rehabilitation program or to an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center or other facility approved by the chief of the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit in the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the Department of [Health] Human Services.  For a third or subsequent offense a person shall not serve a term of imprisonment at an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center as provided in subsection (f). A person who has been convicted of a previous violation of this section need not be charged as a second or subsequent offender in the complaint made against him in order to render him liable to the punishment imposed by this section on a second or subsequent offender, but if the second offense occurs more than 10 years after the first offense, the court shall treat the second conviction as a first offense for sentencing purposes and if a third offense occurs more than 10 years after the second offense, the court shall treat the third conviction as a second offense for sentencing purposes. (b)   A person convicted under this section must satisfy the screening, evaluation, referral, program and fee requirements of the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services' Intoxicated Driving Program Unit, and of the Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers and a program of alcohol and drug education and highway safety, as prescribed by the chief administrator. The sentencing court shall inform the person convicted that failure to satisfy such requirements shall result in a mandatory two-day term of imprisonment in a county jail and a driver license revocation or suspension and continuation of revocation or suspension until such requirements are satisfied, unless stayed by court order in accordance with the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey, or R.S.39:5-22. Upon sentencing, the court shall forward to the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services' Intoxicated Driving Program Unit a copy of a person's conviction record.  A fee of $100 shall be payable to the Alcohol Education, Rehabilitation and Enforcement Fund established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1983, c.531 (C.26:2B-32) to support the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit. (c)   Upon conviction of a violation of this section, the court shall collect forthwith the New Jersey driver's license or licenses of the person so convicted and forward such license or licenses to the chief administrator.  The court shall inform the person convicted that if he is convicted of personally operating a motor vehicle during the period of license suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, he shall, upon conviction, be subject to the penalties established in R.S.39:3-40. The person convicted shall be informed orally and in writing.  A person shall be required to acknowledge receipt of that written notice in writing. Failure to receive a written notice or failure to acknowledge in writing the receipt of a written notice shall not be a defense to a subsequent charge of a violation of R.S.39:3-40.  In the event that a person convicted under this section is the holder of any out-of-State driver's license, the court shall not collect the license but shall notify forthwith the chief administrator, who shall, in turn, notify appropriate officials in the licensing jurisdiction.  The court shall, however, revoke the nonresident's driving privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this State, in accordance with this section.  Upon conviction of a violation of this section, the court shall notify the person convicted, orally and in writing, of the penalties for a second, third or subsequent violation of this section.  A person shall be required to acknowledge receipt of that written notice in writing. Failure to receive a written notice or failure to acknowledge in writing the receipt of a written notice shall not be a defense to a subsequent charge of a violation of this section. (d)   The chief administrator shall promulgate rules and regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) in order to establish a program of alcohol education and highway safety, as prescribed by [this act] P.L.1977, c.29. (e)   Any person accused of a violation of this section who is liable to punishment imposed by this section as a second or subsequent offender shall be entitled to the same rights of discovery as allowed defendants pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey. (f)   The counties, in cooperation with the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services and the commission, but subject to the approval of the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services, shall designate and establish on a county or regional basis Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers.  These centers shall have the capability of serving as community treatment referral centers and as court monitors of a person's compliance with the ordered treatment, service alternative or community service.  All centers established pursuant to this subsection shall be administered by a counselor certified by the Addiction Professionals Certification Board of New Jersey or other professional with a minimum of five years' experience in the treatment of alcoholism.  All centers shall be required to develop individualized treatment plans for all persons attending the centers; provided that the duration of any ordered treatment or referral shall not exceed one year.  It shall be the center's responsibility to establish networks with the community alcohol and drug education, treatment and rehabilitation resources and to receive monthly reports from the referral agencies regarding a person's participation and compliance with the program. Nothing in this subsection shall bar these centers from developing their own education and treatment programs; provided that they are approved by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services. Upon a person's failure to report to the initial screening or any subsequent ordered referral, the Intoxicated Driver Resource Center shall promptly notify the sentencing court of the person's failure to comply. Required detention periods at the Intoxicated Driver Resource Centers shall be determined according to the individual treatment classification assigned by the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit. Upon attendance at an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center, a person shall be required to pay a per diem fee of $75 for the first offender program or a per diem fee of $100 for the second offender program, as appropriate.  Any increases in the per diem fees after the first full year shall be determined pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by the Commissioner of [Health] Human Services in consultation with the [Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse] Office of Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Policy pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). The centers shall conduct a program of alcohol and drug education and highway safety, as prescribed by the chief administrator. The Commissioner of [Health] Human Services shall adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), in order to effectuate the purposes of this subsection. (g)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.248) (h)   A court also may order a person convicted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, to participate in a supervised visitation program as either a condition of probation or a form of community service, giving preference to those who were under the age of 21 at the time of the offense.  Prior to ordering a person to participate in such a program, the court may consult with any person who may provide useful information on the defendant's physical, emotional and mental suitability for the visit to ensure that it will not cause any injury to the defendant.  The court also may order that the defendant participate in a counseling session under the supervision of the Intoxicated Driving Program Unit prior to participating in the supervised visitation program.  The supervised visitation program shall be at one or more of the following facilities which have agreed to participate in the program under the supervision of the facility's personnel and the probation department: (1)   a trauma center, critical care center or acute care hospital having basic emergency services, which receives victims of motor vehicle accidents for the purpose of observing appropriate victims of drunk drivers and victims who are, themselves, drunk drivers; (2)   a facility which cares for patients who have advanced [alcoholics or drug abusers] alcohol or drug use disorders, to observe persons in the advanced stages of [alcoholism or drug abuse] an alcohol or drug use disorder; or (3)   if approved by a county medical examiner, the office of the county medical examiner or a public morgue to observe appropriate victims of vehicle accidents involving drunk drivers. As used in this section, "appropriate victim" means a victim whose condition is determined by the facility's supervisory personnel and the probation officer to be appropriate for demonstrating the results of accidents involving drunk drivers without being unnecessarily gruesome or traumatic to the defendant. If at any time before or during a visitation the facility's supervisory personnel and the probation officer determine that the visitation may be or is traumatic or otherwise inappropriate for that defendant, the visitation shall be terminated without prejudice to the defendant.  The program may include a personal conference after the visitation, which may include the sentencing judge or the judge who coordinates the program for the court, the defendant, defendant's counsel, and, if available, the defendant's parents to discuss the visitation and its effect on the defendant's future conduct.  If a personal conference is not practicable because of the defendant's absence from the jurisdiction, conflicting time schedules, or any other reason, the court shall require the defendant to submit a written report concerning the visitation experience and its impact on the defendant.  The county, a court, any facility visited pursuant to the program, any agents, employees, or independent contractors of the court, county, or facility visited pursuant to the program, and any person supervising a defendant during the visitation, are not liable for any civil damages resulting from injury to the defendant, or for civil damages associated with the visitation which are caused by the defendant, except for willful or grossly negligent acts intended to, or reasonably expected to result in, that injury or damage. The Supreme Court may adopt court rules or directives to effectuate the purposes of this subsection. (i)    In addition to any other fine, fee, or other charge imposed pursuant to law, the court shall assess a person convicted of a violation of the provisions of this section a surcharge of $125, of which amount $50 shall be payable to the municipality in which the conviction was obtained, $50 shall be payable to the Treasurer of the State of New Jersey for deposit into the General Fund, and $25 which shall be payable as follows: in a matter where the summons was issued by a municipality's law enforcement agency, to that municipality to be used for the cost of equipping police vehicles with mobile video recording systems pursuant to the provisions of section 1 of P.L.2014, c.54 (C.40A:14-118.1); in a matter where the summons was issued by a county's law enforcement agency, to that county; and in a matter where the summons was issued by a State law enforcement agency, to the General Fund. (cf: P.L.2019, c.248, s.2) 14.  Section 26 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-46) is amended to read as follows: 26.  Access to prescription information. a.     The division shall maintain procedures to ensure privacy and confidentiality of patients and that patient information collected, recorded, transmitted, and maintained is not disclosed, except as permitted in this section, including, but not limited to, the use of a password-protected system for maintaining this information and permitting access thereto as authorized under sections 25 through 30 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-45 through C.45:1-50), and a requirement that a person as listed in subsection h. or i. of this section provide affirmation of the person's intent to comply with the provisions of sections 25 through 30 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-45 through C.45:1-50) as a condition of accessing the information. b.    The prescription monitoring information submitted to the division shall be confidential and not be subject to public disclosure under P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), or P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5 et al.). c.     The division shall review the prescription monitoring information provided by a pharmacy permit holder pursuant to sections 25 through 30 of P.L.2007, c.244 (C.45:1-45 through C.45:1-50).  The review shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   a review to identify whether any person is obtaining a prescription in a manner that may be indicative of misuse, abuse, or diversion of a controlled dangerous substance.  The director shall establish guidelines regarding the terms "misuse," "abuse," and "diversion" for the purposes of this review.  When an evaluation of the information indicates that a person may be obtaining a prescription for the same or a similar controlled dangerous substance from multiple practitioners or pharmacists during the same time period, the division may provide prescription monitoring information about the person to practitioners and pharmacists; and (2)   a review to identify whether a violation of law or regulation or a breach of the applicable standards of practice by any person may have occurred, including, but not limited to, diversion of a controlled dangerous substance.  If the division determines that such a violation or breach may have occurred, the division shall notify the appropriate law enforcement agency or professional licensing board, and provide the prescription monitoring information required for an investigation. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2015, c.74) e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2015, c.74) f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2015, c.74) g.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2015, c.74) h.

(cf: P.L.1993, c.216, s.5) 16.  This act shall take effect 120 days after the date of enactment, but the Commissioner of Health, the Commissioner of Human Services, the Attorney General, the Assistant Commissioner for the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the Department of Human Services, and the Assistant Commissioner for the Childrens System of Care in the Department of Children and Families may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary to implement the provisions of this act. STATEMENT This bill establishes the Office of Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Policy (Office).  The Office will be responsible for reviewing and coordinating all State departments' efforts with regard to the planning and provision of treatment, prevention, research, evaluation, and education services for, and public awareness of, alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders.  The Office will serve strategic planning, advisory, coordination, communication, and development functions in order to coordinate Statewide efforts and drive improvements in the prevention of, and provision of treatment for, alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders.  The Office will be allocated within the Department of the Treasury but will be independent of the department and will report directly to the Governor. The duties of the Office will include developing a Comprehensive Statewide Alcohol Use Disorders and Drug Use Disorders Master Plan, to be submitted to the Governor and the Legislature by July 1 of each year, for the treatment, prevention, research, evaluation, education, and public awareness of alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders.  The plan is to:  incorporate and unify all State, county, local, and private alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders initiatives; include an emphasis on prevention, community awareness, and family and youth services; and include recommendations for funding allocations. The Office will be required to review County Annual Alliance Plans and propose recommendations for awarding Alliance grants, and will additionally be responsible for distributing certain grants to counties and municipalities for alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders programs and evaluating the existing funding mechanisms for treatment services for alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders. The Office will be required to encourage the development or expansion of employee assistance programs for both government and private sector employees. The Office will be authorized to call upon any department, office, division, agency, or independent authority of State government to provide such information, resources, or other assistance as may be necessary to discharge the duties and functions of the Office and fulfill its responsibilities.  The Office may collect from any State, county, local governmental entity, or any other appropriate source data, reports, statistics, or other materials which are necessary to carry out the functions of the Office. The executive director of the Office will be required to convene a meeting, on at least an annual basis and at such additional intervals as the executive director of the office deems necessary, to be attended by the Attorney General, the Commissioner of Health, the Commissioner of Human Services, the Commissioner of Education, the Commissioner of Corrections, the Commissioner of Children and Families, the Commissioner of Community Affairs, the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, the Assistant Commissioner for the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the Assistant Commissioner for the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, the Assistant Commissioner for the Childrens System of Care, and other appropriate agencies, officers, and entities, in order to plan, develop, and coordinate State and local efforts to improve the prevention of, and the provision of treatment for, alcohol and drug use disorders. The Office will be administered by an executive director, who will be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.  The executive director is to be a person qualified by education, training, and experience to perform the duties of the office.  The executive director will serve at the pleasure of the Governor during the Governor's term of office and until the appointment and qualification of the executive director's successor.  The executive director will have the power to employ staff within the limits of funds appropriated or made available for that purpose, and will have broad authority to coordinate communication between, and request and receive information from, any department, division, or agency of the State.  The executive director will be required to devote full time to the duties and responsibilities of the office, and will receive a salary as provided by law. The Office will be required to develop and maintain a centralized Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Treatment Resource Database that can be used to track Statewide treatment data, direct resources, develop recommendations regarding the allocation of funding and resources, facilitate referrals to available treatment resources, and evaluate provider performance.  Specifically, treatment providers will be required to report certain data concerning patient wait times, the levels and duration of treatment provided to patients, the number of patients referred to other treatment providers and the reasons for those referrals, treatment completion rates, relapse and long-term recovery rates, and any other data or metrics the Office deems necessary and appropriate.  The Office will use this data to evaluate provider performance as well as to develop best practices guidelines and performance benchmarks. Additionally, treatment providers will be required update the database to indicate the availability of treatment spots at the provider, including the level of treatment available in each spot, the number of patients awaiting treatment, and the providers anticipated treatment availability in the next 24 hours.  Providers will be required to update this information at least once every 12 hours, and at more frequent intervals if the Office determines that more frequent or real-time reporting is feasible and appropriate.  Treatment providers and agencies, offices, and other entities that serve as a contact point for patients seeking treatment will have access to the treatment availability information in the database for the purpose of referring patients to treatment. The Office will be required to collaborate with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Health to include in the centralized database data concerning the number, location, and types of interventions performed throughout the State to treat drug overdoses, and in particular overdoses involving opioid drugs, in order to identify patterns in overdose incidents, coordinate outreach efforts in the affected communities, and determine and direct the Statewide allocation of funding and resources for the treatment of drug use disorders. The Office will be authorized to establish programs providing financial and other incentives to treatment providers who achieve certain performance benchmarks established by the Office to drive improvements in the treatment of alcohol and drug use disorders. Benchmark goals may address patient wait times, patient retention, patient progression through a course of treatment, and the number and rate of patients who complete treatment.  The Office will be required to periodically review and revise any incentive programs it establishes in order to maintain the integrity of the program, ensure the program is realizing improvements in patient care, modify benchmarks as needed, and revise or eliminate any aspects of a program that may result in adverse unintended consequences. The Office is to utilize the database and consult with treatment providers and appropriate State, county, and local agencies to identify barriers that reduce the ability of patients to access appropriate treatment services.  The Office is to develop appropriate responses to address or remove barriers to access, which may include: developing programs to provide transportation assistance, child care assistance, or home visits; working with health benefits carriers to secure coverage for all appropriate treatment modalities and services related to treatment; and working with treatment providers to promote flexible scheduling and expanded hours, and encourage and support providers to become authorized to prescribe and administer medication-assisted treatment. For the purposes of establishing and maintaining a centralized database, the Office will be permitted to utilize, modify, or adapt any existing systems that provide functions related to, or that would supplement, the functions and purpose of the centralized database.  The Office will also be authorized to contract with an independent third party to establish and maintain the database. The bill provides that, to the extent that the centralized database includes any personal identifying information or any confidential health information concerning any patient, such information may not be disclosed to any entity except as may be required pursuant to State or federal law.  The Office is to seek to avoid requiring any personal identifying information or confidential health information to be reported to, or included in, the database. The Office will be required to make available to the public, through its Internet website, certain data concerning the provision of treatment for alcohol and drug use disorders, including:  patient wait times; treatment program completion rates; reasons for non-completion of treatment; the level and nature of treatment modalities provided and the average duration of each phase of treatment; long-term recovery rates; remission and overdose rates; patient referrals made by treatment providers to other providers; and any other information the office deems appropriate. The Office will be required to develop standards, policies, and procedures to support the various departments, divisions, agencies, offices, and other entities that enter into contracts with treatment providers to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and any applicable State or federal laws, regulations, and requirements, including: ensuring that any requirements for payment under the contract are met; ensuring providers are complying with all applicable criminal history record background check and drug testing requirements for provider staff; and ensuring prompt reconciliation of any claims for payment, including promptly closing out contracts, processing claims, and collecting receivables and other amounts owed.  For this purpose, the Office will be authorized to designate a compliance officer, who may retain appropriate staff to provide support services to the various departments, divisions, agencies, offices, and other entities. The bill revises various provisions of the current statutory law to update references to include the Office and to transfer certain functions of the Governors Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse to the Office.
