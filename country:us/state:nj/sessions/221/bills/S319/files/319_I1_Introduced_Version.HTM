current information concerning the providers available treatment services and
resources.  The information reported by treatment providers shall include the
providers current number of open treatment spots, the level of treatment
available in each spot, the number of patients currently awaiting treatment
through the provider, and the number of treatment spots that the provider
reasonably anticipates will become available within the next 24 hours,

utilize the data reported to the centralized database to develop best practices
guidelines and performance benchmarks for treatment providers.  The office, in
its discretion, may establish a program to provide financial or other
incentives to treatment providers who achieve certain performance benchmarks in
such areas as the office determines appropriate to drive improvements in the
provision of treatment for alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders,
including, but not limited to, achieving specified goals with regard to patient
wait times, patient retention rates, patient progression through a course of
treatment, the number and rate of patients who complete treatment, and other
specific patient outcomes.  The office shall periodically review and revise any
incentive program established pursuant to this section to maintain the
integrity of the incentive program, to ensure the incentive program is
achieving improvements in patient care, to review and revise the benchmarks as
needed to better achieve the intended outcomes and goals, and to revise or
eliminate any aspects of an incentive program that may result in adverse
unintended consequences in the provision of treatment to patients.</p>

the data reported to the centralized database and consult with treatment
providers and appropriate State, county, and local agencies to identify

resources for the treatment of alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders. 
The office shall develop appropriate responses to address or remove barriers to
access, which may include: programs to provide transportation assistance, child
care assistance, or home visits; working with health benefits carriers to
secure coverage for all appropriate treatment modalities and services related
to treatment; and working with treatment providers to promote flexible
scheduling and expanded hours, and to encourage and support providers in
becoming authorized to prescribe and administer medication-assisted treatment.</p>

treatment for, alcohol and drug use disorders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Office will be
administered by an executive director, who will be appointed by the Governor
with the advice and consent of the Senate.  The executive director is to be a
person qualified by education, training, and experience to perform the duties
of the office.  The executive director will serve at the pleasure of the
Governor during the Governor's term of office and until the appointment and
qualification of the executive director's successor.  The executive director
will have the power to employ staff within the limits of funds appropriated or
made available for that purpose, and will have broad authority to coordinate
communication between, and request and receive information from, any
department, division, or agency of the State.  The executive director will be
required to devote full time to the duties and responsibilities of the office,
and will receive a salary as provided by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Office will be required to
develop and maintain a centralized Alcohol and Drug Use Disorders Treatment
Resource Database that can be used to track Statewide treatment data, direct
resources, develop recommendations regarding the allocation of funding and
resources, facilitate referrals to available treatment resources, and evaluate
provider performance.  Specifically, treatment providers will be required to
report certain data concerning patient wait times, the levels and duration of
treatment provided to patients, the number of patients referred to other
treatment providers and the reasons for those referrals, treatment completion
rates, relapse and long-term recovery rates, and any other data or metrics the
Office deems necessary and appropriate.  The Office will use this data to
evaluate provider performance as well as to develop best practices guidelines
and performance benchmarks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, treatment
providers will be required update the database to indicate the availability of
treatment spots at the provider, including the level of treatment available in
each spot, the number of patients awaiting treatment, and the providers
anticipated treatment availability in the next 24 hours.  Providers will be
required to update this information at least once every 12 hours, and at more
frequent intervals if the Office determines that more frequent or real-time
reporting is feasible and appropriate.  Treatment providers and agencies,
offices, and other entities that serve as a contact point for patients seeking
treatment will have access to the treatment availability information in the
database for the purpose of referring patients to treatment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Office will be required to
collaborate with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of
Health to include in the centralized database data concerning the number,
location, and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>types of interventions performed
throughout the State to treat drug overdoses, and in particular overdoses
involving opioid drugs, in order to identify patterns in overdose incidents,
coordinate outreach efforts in the affected communities, and determine and
direct the Statewide allocation of funding and resources for the treatment of
drug use disorders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Office will be authorized
to establish programs providing financial and other incentives to treatment
providers who achieve certain performance benchmarks established by the Office
to drive improvements in the treatment of alcohol and drug use disorders. 
Benchmark goals may address patient wait times, patient retention, patient
progression through a course of treatment, and the number and rate of patients
who complete treatment.  The Office will be required to periodically review and
revise any incentive programs it establishes in order to maintain the integrity
of the program, ensure the program is realizing improvements in patient care,
modify benchmarks as needed, and revise or eliminate any aspects of a program
that may result in adverse unintended consequences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Office is to utilize the
database and consult with treatment providers and appropriate State, county,
and local agencies to identify barriers that reduce the ability of patients to
access appropriate treatment services.  The Office is to develop appropriate
responses to address or remove barriers to access, which may include: 
developing programs to provide transportation assistance, child care
assistance, or home visits; working with health benefits carriers to secure
coverage for all appropriate treatment modalities and services related to
treatment; and working with treatment providers to promote flexible scheduling
and expanded hours, and encourage and support providers to become authorized to
prescribe and administer medication-assisted treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of
establishing and maintaining a centralized database, the Office will be
permitted to utilize, modify, or adapt any existing systems that provide
functions related to, or that would supplement, the functions and purpose of
the centralized database.  The Office will also be authorized to contract with
an independent third party to establish and maintain the database.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that, to the
extent that the centralized database includes any personal identifying
information or any confidential health information concerning any patient, such
information may not be disclosed to any entity except as may be required
pursuant to State or federal law.  The Office is to seek to avoid requiring any
personal identifying information or confidential health information to be
reported to, or included in, the database. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Office will be required to
make available to the public, through its Internet website, certain data
concerning the provision of treatment for alcohol and drug use disorders,
including:  patient wait times; treatment program completion rates; reasons for
non-completion of treatment; the level and nature of treatment </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>modalities provided and the average
duration of each phase of treatment; long-term recovery rates; remission and
overdose rates; patient referrals made by treatment providers to other
providers; and any other information the office deems appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Office will be required to
develop standards, policies, and procedures to support the various departments,
divisions, agencies, offices, and other entities that enter into contracts with
treatment providers to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract and any
applicable State or federal laws, regulations, and requirements, including: 
ensuring that any requirements for payment under the contract are met; ensuring
providers are complying with all applicable criminal history record background
check and drug testing requirements for provider staff; and ensuring prompt
reconciliation of any claims for payment, including promptly closing out
contracts, processing claims, and collecting receivables and other amounts
owed.  For this purpose, the Office will be authorized to designate a
compliance officer, who may retain appropriate staff to provide support
services to the various departments, divisions, agencies, offices, and other
entities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill revises various
provisions of the current statutory law to update references to include the
Office and to transfer certain functions of the Governors Council on
Alcoholism and Drug Abuse to the Office.</p>
