A3101 ASSEMBLY, No. 3101 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  CRAIG J. COUGHLIN District 19 (Middlesex) Assemblywoman  SHAVONDA E. SUMTER District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Allows certain State agencies to sell Internet advertisements on agencies websites as pilot program. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act allowing certain State agencies to sell Internet advertisements on the agencies websites as a pilot program and supplementing chapter 32 of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.   The Legislature finds and declares that: a. State agency websites provide timely and useful information to the public about State agency programs and services. b. These websites are informative in nature and do not serve as a public forum or a limited public forum for the discussion or exchange of ideas. c. Allowing State agencies to sell Internet advertisements for display on their web pages could provide new sources of revenue for the State, particularly for those State agencies that maintain high-traffic web pages. d. It is the express intention of the Legislature that the space allocated for advertising be a non-public forum and that acceptance of advertising on a State agency website will not provide or create a general or designated public forum for expressive activities. e. The State maintains an interest in preserving a degree of political neutrality on websites designed to address matters of public significance and in avoiding a misperceived promotion of certain products that can be detrimental to the public health, and therefore, finds it proper to prohibit certain subject matter, such as tobacco, alcohol, and political advocacy, from appearing on State agency websites. f. Other restrictions may be important for or otherwise consistent with preserving a website for the purpose to which it is dedicated, including, but not limited to, the avoidance of advertising that reduces the competitiveness or is otherwise antithetical to the mission of the agency. g. Therefore, the Legislature intends to allow a limited number of State agencies to establish a pilot program to sell Internet advertisements for display on their websites, provided that the advertisements are consistent with the business mission of the agency as well as any Internet advertisement guidelines adopted by the agency. 2.   a.

Advertisements for tobacco or alcohol products, for political advocacy, or that reduce the competitiveness or are otherwise antithetical to the mission of the agency shall be prohibited, in addition to any other advertisements for products or services, or by sponsors, that the head of such agency deems inappropriate.  In locations where Internet advertisements are offered on a State agency web page, the web page shall also include a disclaimer, indicating that the inclusion of Internet advertisements does not imply endorsement by the State. c. The Department of the Treasury shall, within 90 days following enactment of this act, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), establish rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of this act, including rules providing for the application and approval of an agency to establish a pilot program. The rules established by the department pursuant to this section shall be effective immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 42 months and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). d. Not later than three months after the conclusion of the pilot program by a State agency, the agency shall submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1) that evaluates the effectiveness of the pilot program.  The report shall include a detailed summary of both the expenditures made and the revenues produced under the program, as well as recommendations concerning whether to continue the program. e.

(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be deposited into the State General Fund by a State agency for which expenditures are authorized through the State annual appropriations act.  There shall be appropriated annually such funds as are determined to be necessary to each such agency for the incremental cost of offering Internet advertisements and an additional 10 percent of such revenue generated by that agency for the purpose of innovation in operations, programs, or services.

The bill provides that each agency must develop policy, style, and content guidelines for website advertisements that ensure that the subject matter of the advertisement directly relates to the agencys business mission and purpose, and must submit those guidelines to the department for approval. Revenue generated will be deposited into the State General Fund by agencies for which expenditures are authorized through the annual appropriations act.
