Fund, amending P.L.1958, c.143 and N.J.S.18A:66-56, and supplementing chapter
66 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  N.J.S.18A:66-56 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     18A:66-56. a. (1) Subject to
the provisions of chapter 70 of the laws of 1955, the general responsibility
for the proper operation of the teachers' pension and annuity fund shall be
vested in the board of trustees, and, as specified, in the committee
established pursuant to subsection b. of this section. Subject to the
limitations of the law, the board shall annually establish rules and regulations
for the administration and transaction of the board's and committee's business
and for the control of the funds created by this article.  Such rules and
regulations shall be consistent with those adopted by the other pension funds
within the Division of Pensions and Benefits in order to permit the most
economical and uniform administration of all such retirement systems.  The
committee shall adopt such regulations as provided in subsection b. of this
section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The membership of the
board shall consist of the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The State Treasurer or
the deputy State Treasurer, when designated for that purpose by the State
Treasurer;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Two trustees appointed
by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, who shall serve for
a term of office of three years and until their successors are appointed, and
who shall be private citizens of the State of New Jersey and who are neither an
officer thereof nor active or retired members of the system, except that of the
two trustees initially appointed by the Governor pursuant to P.L.1992, c.41
(C.43:6A-33.1 et al.), one shall be appointed for a term of two years and one
for a term of three years;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Three trustees from
among the active or retired members of the retirement system, elected by the membership
or by the delegates elected for this purpose by the membership, one of whom
shall be elected each year for a three-year term commencing on January 1,
following such election in such manner as the board of trustees may prescribe. 
If the board of trustees determines that the election of trustees under this
subsection is to be made by delegates elected by the membership, it shall
prescribe that those delegates shall be chosen from among active and retired
members of the retirement system;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   One trustee not an
active or retired teacher nor an officer of the State, elected by the other
trustees, other than the State Treasurer, for a term of three years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   A vacancy occurring in
the board of trustees shall be filled in the same manner as provided in this
section for regular appointment or election to the position where the vacancy
exists, except that a vacancy occurring in the trustees elected from among the
active or retired members of the retirement system shall be filled for the
unexpired term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each member of the board
shall, upon appointment or election, take an oath of office that, so far as it
devolves upon him, he will diligently and honestly administer the board's
affairs, and that he will not knowingly violate or willfully permit to be violated
any provision of law applicable to this article.  The oath shall be subscribed
to by the member making it, certified by the officer before whom it is taken
and filed immediately in the office of the Secretary of State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each trustee shall be entitled
to one vote in the board and a majority of all the votes of the entire board
shall be necessary for a decision by the board of trustees at a meeting of the
board or committee.  The board shall keep a record of all its proceedings,
which shall be open to public inspection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The members of the board shall
serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for any necessary
expenditures.  No employee shall suffer loss of salary or wages through serving
on the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The State Treasurer
shall designate a medical board after consultation with the Director of the
Division of Pensions and Benefits, subject to veto by the board for valid
reason.  It shall be composed of three physicians who are not eligible to
participate in the retirement system. The medical board shall pass upon all
medical examinations required under the provisions of this article, shall
investigate all essential statements and certificates by or on behalf of a
member in connection with an application for disability retirement, and shall report
in writing to the retirement system its conclusions and recommendations upon
all matters referred to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    There is established a
committee to be composed of eight members, four of whom shall be appointed by
the Governor as representatives of public employers whose employees are
enrolled in the retirement system, three of whom shall be appointed by the head
of the union representing the greatest number of members of the retirement
system having union membership, and one of whom shall be appointed by the head
of the union representing the second greatest number of members of the
retirement system having union membership.  The members of the committee shall
