<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) Sections 1
through 10 of
P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited
as the Fairness in Special Education Funding for Student Success Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The federal
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. s.1400 et seq.,
guarantees that a student with a disability will have access to a free
appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment possible
given the childs individual needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The federal government
provides funding to states and school districts to offset the additional costs
that school districts inevitably incur when providing special education and
related services to these students.  The IDEA gives the Secretary of the United
States Department of Education the authority to provide states and school
districts with grants in an amount up to 40 percent of these excess costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Historically, the
federal government has failed to appropriate sufficient resources to provide
states and school districts with the maximum amount of funding authorized under
the IDEA.  In recent years, federal appropriations have provided for less than
20 percent of the excess costs incurred in educating students with
disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Similarly, State support
for special education has consistently fallen short of promises made.  Despite
State law mandating that school districts be reimbursed for a portion of the
cost of educating particularly high-cost special education students, the
States appropriations acts have consistently failed to provide funding
sufficient to provide for the full reimbursement established under that statute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     While federal and State
government have failed to provide resources for the provision of special
education services in the manner that has been promised over the years, school
districts continue to be responsible for educating all students with disabilities
so that they may reach their full potential and live successful and fulfilling
lives.  In meeting this obligation, school districts are often forced to make
unconscionable choices between special education programs and the services
provided to other students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     It is time for the
State of New Jersey to finally meet its obligations to students with
disabilities and their families by providing greater resources to ensure that
they all have access to the free appropriate public education required under
federal law.  At the same time, the State must provide adequate oversight to
guarantee that these students are educated in the least restrictive environment
so that they may have the greatest opportunity to learn and grow with their
peers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The most effective means
to accomplish this goal is for the State to assume the responsibility for
entering into contracts with, and making payments to, providers of special
education and related services to students with disabilities who require the
most expensive services.  Such a system would provide a substantial increase in
State financial support for school districts to meet their obligations, provide
actionable information and transparency regarding both quality and cost
effectiveness of providers across the entire spectrum of placements and
maintain equity in the provision of these services throughout the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  As used
in sections 1 through 10 of
P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
(pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Final contract cost means an

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The Constitution of the
State of New Jersey states that the Legislature shall provide for the
maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public
schools for the instruction of all children in the State between the ages of
five and eighteen years.  (N.J. Const. art. VIII, sec. 4, par.1).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The State, in addition
to any constitutional mandates, has a moral obligation to ensure that New
Jersey's children, wherever they reside, are provided the skills and knowledge
necessary to succeed.  Any school funding formula should provide resources in a
manner that optimizes the likelihood that children will receive an education
that will make them productive members of society. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Although the Supreme
Court of New Jersey has held that prior school funding statutes did not
establish a system of public education that was thorough and efficient as to
certain districts, the Court has consistently held that the Legislature has the
responsibility to substantively define what constitutes a thorough and
efficient system of education responsive to that constitutional requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Every child in New
Jersey must have an opportunity for an education based on academic standards
that satisfy constitutional requirements regardless of where the child resides,
and public funds allocated to this purpose must be expended to support schools
that are thorough and efficient in delivering those educational standards.  In
turn, school districts must be assured the financial support necessary to
provide those constitutionally compelled educational standards.  Any school
funding formula should provide State aid for every school district based on the
characteristics of the student population and up-to-date measures of the
individual district's ability to pay. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     New Jersey's current
public school funding formula, established under the provisions of the
&quot;Comprehensive Educational Improvement and Financing Act of 1996,&quot;
(CEIFA) P.L.1996,&nbsp;c.138, has not been used to calculate State aid for
public schools since the 2001-02 school year.  Any new school funding formula
should account for changes in enrollment and other significant developments,
providing relief to those districts that have experienced substantial
enrollment increases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The decisions in the
Abbott cases have resulted in frequent litigation and a fragmented system of
funding under which limited resources cannot be distributed equitably to all
districts where at-risk children reside, instead dividing the districts sharply
into Abbott and non-Abbott categories for funding purposes without regard to a
district's particular pupil characteristics and leading to needlessly
adversarial relationships among school districts and between districts and the
State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    In the absence of a
clear, unitary, enforceable statutory formula to govern appropriations for
education, crucial funding decisions are made annually, in competition for
limited State resources with other needs and requirements as part of the annual
budget negotiation process, utilizing many different classes and categories of
aid, leading to an uncertain, unpredictable, and untenable funding situation
for the State and school districts alike.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    This act represents the
culmination of five years of diligent efforts by both the Executive and
Legislative branches of State government to develop an equitable and
predictable way to distribute State aid that addresses the deficiencies found
in past formulas as identified by the Supreme Court.  Working together toward
this common goal, the Department of Education and the Legislature engaged
nationally recognized experts in education funding and provided significant
opportunities for stakeholder involvement and public input to assist in
formulating and refining a comprehensive school funding model that has been
validated by experts.  The formula accounts for the individual characteristics
of school districts and the realities of their surroundings, including the need
for additional resources to address the increased disadvantages created by high
concentrations of children at-risk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The formula established
under this act is the product of a careful and deliberative process that first
involved determining the educational inputs necessary to provide a high-quality
education, including specifically addressing the supplemental needs of at-risk
students and those with limited English proficiency (LEP), and a determination
of the actual cost of providing those programs.  The formula provides adequate
funding that is realistically geared to the core curriculum content standards,
thus linking those standards to the actual funding needed to deliver that
content. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     In recognition of the
unique problems and cost disadvantages faced by districts with high
concentrations of at-risk students, it is appropriate to reflect in the formula
a greater weight as the district's proportion of at-risk students increases. 
In addition, the new formula recognizes the disadvantages of an expanded group
of students by including in the definition of at-risk those students who
qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.  Expanding the definition of at-risk
students in this manner will significantly increase the resources flowing to
districts with high concentrations of these low-income students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    In light of the
demonstrable, beneficial results and success of the current Abbott preschool
program, it is appropriate to build upon this success by incorporating in the
formula an expanded high-quality preschool program for all children who qualify
for free and reduced price meals in all districts.  It is appropriate for the
formula to acknowledge that at-risk children do not always receive the same
educational exposure at an early age as their peers and to provide the
additional resources necessary through high-quality preschool to prepare every
child to learn and succeed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>It is
appropriate to reflect in this formula the inherent value of educating a child
in the least restrictive environment and, whenever possible, in that child's
neighborhood school alongside his peers.  The new funding formula should
provide incentives for keeping classified students in district.<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> (<u>Deleted
by amendment, P.L.    , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.   It is also appropriate to
recognize in the formula the need for all schools to incorporate effective
security measures, which may vary from district to district depending upon the
at-risk student population and other factors, and to provide categorical funding
to address these important requirements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.    In recognition of the
potentially wide variability in special education costs, even for the same
category of disability, from district to district, it is appropriate for the
new funding formula to mitigate the impact of that variability by establishing
a census model based on the actual Statewide average excess cost of educating
special education students and by providing for an increase in State aid for
extraordinary costs incurred by districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     o.    It is imperative that
any new school funding formula work in conjunction with the key school
accountability measures that have been enacted in recent years to promote
greater oversight, transparency, and efficiency in the delivery of educational
services.  These accountability measures include the New Jersey Quality Single
Accountability Continuum, the &quot;School District Fiscal Accountability
Act,&quot; P.L.2006, c.15 (C.18A:7A-54 et seq.), P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A:65-1 et
al.) which established the duties and responsibilities of the executive county
superintendent of schools, and P.L.2007, c.53 (C.18A:55-3 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     p.    Together with a renewed
legislative focus on and commitment to providing sufficient means to maintain
and support a high-quality system of free public schools in the State, a new
funding formula supported by significantly increased State resources will
ensure compliance with all statutory and constitutional mandates.  Districts
that were formerly designated as Abbott districts will be provided sufficient
resources to continue those Court-identified programs, positions, and services
that have proven effective while being provided the flexibility to shift
resources and programmatic focus based on the needs of their students and
current research.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     q.    The time has come for
the State to resolve the question of the level of funding required to provide a
thorough and efficient system of education for all New Jersey school children. 
The development and implementation of an equitable and adequate school funding
formula will not only ensure that the State's students have access to a
constitutional education as defined by the core curriculum content standards,
but also may help to reduce property taxes and assist communities in planning
to meet their educational expenses.  The development of a predictable,
transparent school funding formula is essential for school districts to plan
effectively and deliver the quality education that our citizens expect and our
Constitution requires.</p>

categorical aid, and security categorical aid attributable to those students. 
The State aid payable to a district would also be reduced by the amount of
federal funding awarded under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 attributable to the
students.  In the event that the amount to be deducted exceeds the districts
total State aid payable, then the district would pay the difference to the
State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law,
extraordinary special education costs aid is awarded to school districts as a
reimbursement of costs incurred in the prior school year in educating
individual special education students whose costs exceed certain thresholds. 
This bill eliminates this category of State aid.  However, in the first year in
which the State would assume the costs of high needs placements, the State
would continue to provide the extraordinary special education costs aid
reimbursement for costs incurred in the prior school year.</p>
