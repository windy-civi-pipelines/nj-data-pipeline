(cf: P.L.2017, c.131, s.146) 4.    Section 3 of P.L.1947, c.263 (C.38:18A-3) is amended to read as follows: 3.    Evidence of the service and disability mentioned in this act shall be furnished to the Division of [Veterans'] Veterans Services of the Department of [Human Services] Military and Veterans' Affairs, which shall examine the same and upon being satisfied that the service was performed and the veteran has been rendered permanently paralyzed or has permanently lost the use of both legs, or has suffered amputation, as defined in section 2 of this act, shall so certify to the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury, who shall, upon receipt thereof, draw [his] a warrant on the State Treasurer in favor of the  applicant in the annual sum [of $750.00 annually] provided in section 2 of P.L.1947, c.263 (C.38:18A-2), which the State Treasurer shall pay out of the money appropriated therefor by the Legislature. (cf: P.L.1981, c.424, s.3) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately, and shall be applicable to payments payable on or after the first day of the second month following enactment. STATEMENT The State pays an annual allowance to soldiers and veterans with certain wartime service-connected disabilities. Currently, a blind veteran receives $750 annually under the Blind Veterans' Allowance Program; this amount has not been changed since 1971.  A veteran with certain other described disabilities also receives $750 annually under the Paraplegic and Hemiplegic Veterans' Allowance Program; this amount has not been changed since 1981.  This bill increases these annual payments to $1,500. The bill also provides for an annual adjustment in this allowance in direct proportion to the percent change in the Consumer Price Index over each 12-month period beginning November 1 and ending October 31.  The "Consumer Price Index" is defined as the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Area, All Items (1982-84=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor.  The bill requires an adjustment to be made only if the percent change in the Consumer Price Index results in an increase in the allowance; the allowance will not be reduced if the index experiences a decline. The purpose of this adjustment is to provide a mechanism for ensuring that, for the benefit of these disabled soldiers and veterans, the amount of this allowance keeps pace with cost-of-living increases.
