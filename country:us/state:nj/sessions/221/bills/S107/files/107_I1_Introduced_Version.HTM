<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a loan
program and provides tax credits to persons for the establishment of new
vineyards and wineries in eligible counties.  The bill defines an eligible
county as a county of the third class with a population greater than 150,000
according to the latest federal decennial census, a county of the fifth class,
or a county of the sixth class, and that contains at least three wineries.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the New
Jersey Economic Development Authority (authority), in consultation with the
Department of Agriculture (department), to develop a 10-year pilot program to
provide low interest loans to farmers for qualified costs associated with the
installation of new vineyards in eligible counties.  Qualified costs include
the cost of preparing land for plant installation, purchasing vines or trees,
and purchasing equipment and supplies for those purposes.  It does not include
the cost of tractors, pick-up-trucks, or wine-making equipment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A loan may cover up to 100
percent of the applicants qualified costs, would bear interest of not more
than five percent per year, and would be for a term of not more than 10 years. 
The loan would be made pursuant to a loan agreement with the authority, which
would contain terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the authority.  The
bill permits the authority to require a person that receives a loan to submit
an audited financial statement to the authority in order to ensure the
continued viability of the persons farming operation, and may, either by
regulation or through the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, establish
terms and conditions governing the incidence of default by a person that
receives a loan. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The authority would be
required to submit a report, annually, to the Governor and the Legislature
summarizing each loan made pursuant to the bill, and detailing the
effectiveness of the pilot program in increasing the acreage of commercial
vineyards in eligible counties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also allows eligible
taxpayers to apply for a tax credit against either their corporation business
tax or gross income tax liability in an amount equal to 25 percent of the
qualified capital expenses incurred by taxpayers in connection with: (1) the
establishment of a new vineyard or winery in an eligible county; or (2) capital
improvements made to an existing vineyard or winery in an eligible county.  A
qualified capital expense is any expenditure made by the taxpayer for the
purchase and installation of equipment or agricultural materials for use in the
production of agricultural products at a vineyard or in a winery, as specified
in regulations.  An eligible taxpayer may apply to the department for the approval
of a tax credit for a tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2023 but before
January 1, 2033.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To obtain a tax credit under
the bill, a taxpayer is required to apply for a certification from the
department that certifies:  (1) that the taxpayers expenses are qualified
capital expenses and (2) the amount of the tax credit. Upon certification, the
Secretary of Agriculture (secretary) would submit a copy of the application to
the taxpayer and the Director of the Division of Taxation.  When filing a tax
return that includes a claim for a credit under the bill, a taxpayer would
include a copy of the certification issued by the secretary.  Credits would be
valid in the privilege period or taxable year in which the certification is
approved, and any unused portions could be carried forward into the next 15
privilege periods or taxable years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The secretary would be
required to issue a report to the Governor, State Treasurer, and the
Legislature, annually, on the effectiveness of the tax credit in increasing the
acreage of commercial vineyards and the number of wineries in eligible
counties.</p>
