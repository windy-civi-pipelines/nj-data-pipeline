S2911 SENATE, No. 2911 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 7, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  ANTHONY M. BUCCO District 25 (Morris and Passaic) Senator  BRIAN P. STACK District 33 (Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Senator Space SYNOPSIS Authorizes special plate for holders of "Combat Action Ribbon." CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the "Combat Infantryman Badge" license plate and amending P.L.1993, c.72. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 1 of P.L.1993, c.72 (C.39:3-27.46) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  Upon application of any person who is the holder of a Combat Infantryman Badge or Combat Action Ribbon, as certified on the applicant's DD-214 form or on a Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, the [director] chief administrator shall issue, for the motor vehicle owned or leased by the person, distinctive plates bearing a design approved by the [director] chief administrator in addition to the registration number and other markings or identification prescribed by law. The plates shall bear the words "Combat Infantryman Badge" and depict the Combat Infantryman Badge emblem.  The fee for these plates shall be $15 in addition to the fees otherwise prescribed by law for the registration of motor vehicles. b.    The surviving spouse of a former holder of the Combat Infantryman Badge or Combat Action Ribbon who is eligible to operate a motor vehicle in this State under the provisions of R.S.39:3-10 may retain the special license plates obtained by the deceased spouse pursuant to this section for display on a motor vehicle registered to the surviving spouse under the provisions of R.S.39:3-4. c.     The [director] chief administrator shall promulgate rules and regulations governing the issuance and use of these registration plates. (cf: P.L.1993, c.72, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the law authorizing a "Combat Infantryman Badge" plate so individuals who have been awarded a Combat Action Ribbon are eligible to receive the plate.  Under current law, this plate is only available to the holder of a Combat Infantryman Badge.  This requirement prevents Marines from obtaining the special plate, as they are awarded a Combat Action Ribbon and not a Combat Infantryman Badge. This bill amends the law so Marines are eligible to possess the plates.
