AR37 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 37 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  SEAN T. KEAN District 30 (Monmouth and Ocean) Assemblyman  ALEX SAUICKIE District 12 (Burlington, Middlesex, Monmouth and Ocean) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblyman Scharfenberger and Assemblywoman Flynn SYNOPSIS Urges Governor and Attorney General to provide assistance to municipalities in response to unpermitted mass gatherings and pop-up parties in New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Assembly Resolution urging the Governor and the Attorney General to provide assistance to municipalities in response to unpermitted mass gatherings and pop-up parties in New Jersey. Whereas, Municipalities in New Jersey are the repositories of local police power through their authority to legislate for the general health, safety, and welfare of their residents; and Whereas, Special event permits for events such as block parties, parades, festivals, and carnivals are required by municipalities so local officials and law enforcement may accurately predict the resources and services needed to prepare for and manage crowds; and Whereas, Local communities across our State have experienced a major increase in the number of unpermitted mass gatherings, also known as pop-up parties, that take place on public streets, beaches, and parks; and Whereas, These unpermitted mass gatherings are organized and promoted prominently through the use of social media, where event information may suddenly appear and be quickly disseminated; and Whereas, Large crowds drawn to these unpermitted mass gatherings present an exponentially greater risk of injury and damage caused by crowd-driven destructive behavior, especially when paired with youthfulness, drugs and alcohol, and lack of individual accountability; and Whereas, The inherent danger of these unpermitted mass gatherings was no more evident than on September 24, 2022, when an unsanctioned automotive event known as a street take over terrorized the municipality of Wildwood, resulting in multiple accounts of pedestrian injuries, thousands of dollars in property damage, and the tragic deaths of two individuals; and Whereas, Local law enforcement and municipal officials have worked together in an attempt to prevent these unpermitted mass gatherings, and to quell the disorderly and dangerous conduct that occurs at these unpermitted mass gatherings, but municipalities and local law enforcement agencies are not routinely equipped to handle large, abrupt influxes of borderline riotous crowds; and Whereas, The New Jersey State League of Municipalities Conference passed Resolution No. 2022-13 calling upon the Governor, the Legislature, and the Attorney General to work together and take meaningful, legislative action that addresses the issues stemming from unpermitted mass gatherings; and Whereas, Legislation has been proposed that establishes curfews, upgrades criminal penalties at unpermitted mass gatherings, funds State Police assistance to local law enforcement, and establishes a temporary social media surveillance unit; and Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper to respectfully urge the Governor and the Attorney General to find permanent solutions that increase municipalities resources and enhance their responses to unpermitted mass gatherings; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This House respectfully urges the Governor and the Attorney General to provide assistance to municipalities to help maintain order, protect the general public, and restore peace to communities when individuals and groups spontaneously engage in disorderly and violent behavior. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Attorney General. STATEMENT This resolution urges the Governor and the Attorney General to take necessary measures to bolster municipalities responses to unpermitted mass gatherings and pop-up parties across the State.  Municipalities require special event permits for activities such as block parties, festivals, flea markets, carnivals, concerts, and non-spontaneous public demonstrations.  The permitting process may require up to several months notice to municipalities so they can effectively predict and adequately prepare the resources and personnel necessary to manage large crowds at particular events.  Additionally, the permitting process allows municipalities to deny the permit application if such an event does not seem practical. Local communities in New Jersey, primarily near beaches and other hubs of community activity, have experienced a major increase in spontaneous, unpermitted mass gatherings that bring along disorderly and dangerous conduct.  So called pop-up parties present a great risk of destructive, crowd-driven behavior and dangers that cannot be foreseen.  Local law enforcement and municipal officials have worked together to prevent these unpermitted mass gatherings from taking place with varying degrees of success. The New Jersey State League of Municipalities passed a resolution at its 2022 Conference calling for State assistance and solutions to the myriad issues posed by unpermitted mass gatherings.  State assistance may allow municipalities to better anticipate potential unpermitted mass gatherings, hold organizers and attendees who incite hazards accountable for their misdeeds, and dissuade future pop-up gatherings.
