cannabis was first obtained directly from a licensed cannabis retailer or
delivered by a licensed cannabis delivery service.  The lawful acts include
possessing, displaying, purchasing, or transporting: cannabis paraphernalia;
one ounce (28.35 grams) or less of useable cannabis; the equivalent of one
ounce (28.35 grams) or less of usable cannabis as a cannabis product in solid,

cannabis as a cannabis product in solid, liquid, or concentrate form, based
upon the equivalency calculation for different product forms set by the
commission pursuant to subsection a. of this section; or five grams (0.176

time is still considered a violation of the &quot;Comprehensive Drug Reform Act
of 1987,&quot; P.L.1987, c.106 (N.J.S.2C:35-1 et al.), and can subject the

manufacture, distribute or dispense, or to possess or have under his control
with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense, a controlled dangerous
substance or controlled substance analog. Subparagraph (12) of subsection b.
concerns violations involving marijuana.  A violation of subsection b. with
respect to marijuana in a quantity of one ounce or less is, for a first
offense, subject to a written warning, which also indicates that any subsequent
violation is a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment, a fine, or both, and
for a second or subsequent offense, is a crime of the fourth degree.  </p>

prosecution as a disorderly person.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent to
stress that while gifting is lawful between adults 21 and older under New Jerseys
adult-use cannabis law, entities attempting to preempt the regulatory process
are in violation of the law.</p>
