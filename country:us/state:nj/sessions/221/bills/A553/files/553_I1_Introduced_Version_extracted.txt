Upon receiving a release statement from an insurer, the salvage processor shall, within five business days, provide notice to the owner and any lienholder identified in the records of the commission, informing the owner and any lienholder that the vehicle may be released, upon payment of any outstanding charges, and that failure to claim the vehicle will result in the vehicle being deemed abandoned.  The notice shall include an invoice for any outstanding charges owed to the salvage processor and shall inform the owner or lienholder that the vehicle is required to be claimed within 60 days from the date of the notice.  The notice shall also inform the owner or lienholder of the location of the vehicle.  The notice required under this subsection shall be sent by certified mail or commercial courier whose regular business is delivery service and that provides proof of delivery to the last known address based upon the records of the commission. (2)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, in the event the owner or lienholder of the vehicle does not claim the vehicle within 60 days after the date of the notice, the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and the salvage processor may apply to the chief administrator for the issuance of a salvage certificate of title or a junk title certificate for the motor vehicle in the name of the salvage processor without providing a certificate of ownership.  The application shall include proof that notice was provided to the owner of the motor vehicle and any lienholder.

A power of attorney signed electronically is not required to be notarized but shall, at a minimum, meet security requirements prescribed by the chief administrator. The chief administrator shall adopt regulations to implement the provisions of this subsection, and may prescribe the form and format of an electronically signed power of attorney and any additional security requirements the chief administrator deems necessary, including any requirements to ensure that any power of attorney signed electronically complies with federal odometer disclosure requirements under 49 C.F.R. s.580.1 et seq. i.     (1) With respect to salvage certificates of title and certificates of ownership issued pursuant to this section, the chief administrator shall allow any salvage processor, whose primary business is the sale of total loss motor vehicles on behalf of insurers, to electronically submit applications for the issuance of salvage certificates of title and certificates of ownership, documentation supporting such applications, and any required fees.
