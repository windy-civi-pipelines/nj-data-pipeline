<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1983,
c.323 (C.39:10-32) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  If a motor vehicle
has either been reported as being stolen or suffered sufficient damage to
render it economically impractical to repair, the person in possession of the
certificate of ownership for the vehicle shall surrender the certificate of
ownership to the chief administrator along with a statement setting forth how
the person acquired the certificate of ownership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The chief administrator,
after determining ownership, shall issue a salvage certificate of title to a
person who surrenders a certificate of ownership pursuant to subsection a. of
this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1) Notwithstanding any
provision of law to the contrary, when an insurer licensed to do business in
New Jersey settles a total loss claim with the owner of a motor vehicle, and
the owner of the motor vehicle fails to assign and deliver the motor vehicle's
certificate of ownership to the insurer within 30 days of the payment of the
claim, the insurer or an agent of the insurer may apply to the chief
administrator for a certificate of ownership or a salvage certificate of title
for the motor vehicle in the name of the insurer without providing a
certificate of ownership; provided that the chief administrator determines that
the issuance of a certificate of ownership is appropriate, in accordance with
the provisions of P.L.1983, c.323 (C.39:10-31 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of this
subsection shall only apply when the most recent certificate of ownership for
the motor vehicle was issued by this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The insurer shall
provide notice to the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle identified
in the records of the commission at least 30 days prior to applying for a
certificate of ownership or a salvage certificate of title pursuant to this
subsection.  The notice shall be sent by certified mail or commercial courier
whose regular business is delivery service and that provides proof of delivery
to the owner and any lienholders at the last known address identified in the
records of the commission.  Failure to provide the notice required by this
paragraph shall be cause for the chief administrator to deny issuance of a
certificate of ownership or a salvage certificate of title.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The application for a
certificate of ownership or a salvage certificate of title shall be made on a form
prescribed by the chief administrator and shall include proof of payment of the
claim, proof that the insurer requested the certificate of ownership, and proof
that notice was provided, as required by paragraph (2) of this subsection, to
the owner and any lienholders of the motor vehicle.  Failure to provide the
proof required by this paragraph shall be cause for the chief administrator to
deny issuance of a certificate of ownership or a salvage certificate of title.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   If, based upon the
records of the commission, there was an outstanding lien or liens against the
motor vehicle immediately prior to the payment of the claim and the claim was
paid to a lienholder or lienholders, or to a lienholder or lienholders and the
owner jointly, the proof of payment required pursuant to paragraph (3) of this
subsection shall also include proof that the claim was paid to, or a letter
stating that the lienholder has no interest in the motor vehicle was received
from, each lienholder identified in the records of the commission.  Failure to
provide the proof required by this paragraph shall be cause for the chief
administrator to deny issuance of a certificate of ownership or a salvage
certificate of title.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Upon proper application,
the chief administrator shall issue a certificate of ownership or a salvage
certificate of title, as appropriate, in the name of the insurer.  In the event
the insurer sells the motor vehicle, the insurer shall assign the certificate
of ownership or salvage certificate of title to the buyer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d. (1) Notwithstanding any
provision of law to the contrary, when an insurer licensed to do business in
New Jersey settles a total loss claim with the owner of a motor vehicle, and
the owner of the motor vehicle fails to assign and deliver the motor vehicle's
certificate of ownership to the insurer within 30 days of the payment of the
claim, the insurer or an agent of the insurer may apply to the chief
administrator for a certificate of ownership or a salvage certificate of title

the issuance of a certificate of ownership is appropriate, in accordance with
the provisions of P.L.1983, c.323 (C.39:10-31 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of this
subsection shall only apply when the most recent certificate of ownership for a
motor vehicle was issued by another state; the motor vehicle records of the
jurisdiction that issued the certificate of ownership indicate that there are
no liens recorded against the motor vehicle; and the motor vehicle was damaged,
stolen, or recovered in this State, was owned by a resident of this State
immediately prior to a total loss settlement by an insurer, or as otherwise
permitted by the chief administrator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The insurer shall
provide notice by certified mail or commercial courier whose regular business
is delivery service and that provides proof of delivery to the owner at least

shall be sent by certified mail or commercial courier whose regular business is
delivery service and that provides proof of delivery to the owner and any
lienholder at the last known address based upon the records of the commission. 
Failure to provide the notice required by this paragraph shall be cause for the

motor vehicles on behalf of insurers, take possession of a motor vehicle that
is the subject of an insurance claim and subsequently, the insurer does not
take ownership of the vehicle, the insurer may authorize the salvage processor
to release the vehicle to the owner or lienholder.  The insurer shall provide

statement from an insurer, the salvage processor shall, within five business
days, provide notice to the owner and any lienholder identified in the records
of the commission, informing the owner and any lienholder that the vehicle may
be released, upon payment of any outstanding charges, and that failure to claim
the vehicle will result in the vehicle being deemed abandoned.  The notice
shall include an invoice for any outstanding charges owed to the salvage
processor and shall inform the owner or lienholder that the vehicle is required
to be claimed within 60 days from the date of the notice.  The notice shall
also inform the owner or lienholder of the location of the vehicle.  The notice
required under this subsection shall be sent by certified mail or commercial
courier whose regular business is delivery service and that provides proof of
delivery to the last known address based upon the records of the commission.</p>

provision of law to the contrary, in the event the owner or lienholder of the
vehicle does not claim the vehicle within 60 days after the date of the notice,
the vehicle shall be deemed abandoned and the salvage processor may apply to
the chief administrator for the issuance of a salvage certificate of title or a
junk title certificate for the motor vehicle in the name of the salvage
processor without providing a certificate of ownership.  The application shall
include proof that notice was provided to the owner of the motor vehicle and
any lienholder.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Upon proper application,
the chief administrator shall issue a salvage certificate of title or a junk
title certificate, as appropriate, in the name of the salvage processor, which

title certificate shall be assigned to the buyer and the vehicle shall be
transferred without any liens against it.</p>
