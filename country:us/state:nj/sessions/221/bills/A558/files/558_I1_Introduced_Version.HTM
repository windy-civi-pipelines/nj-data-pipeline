<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 10 of P.L.1991,
c.261 (C.2C:25-26) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  a.  When a defendant
charged with a crime or offense involving domestic violence is released from
custody before trial on bail or personal recognizance, the court authorizing
the release may as a condition of release issue an order prohibiting the defendant
from having any contact with the victim including, but not limited to,
restraining the defendant from entering the victim's residence, place of
employment or business, or school, and from harassing or stalking the victim or
the victim's friends, co-workers, or relatives in any way.  <u>If the victim is
pregnant, at the victims request the court may order that the victims child
shall, immediately upon birth, be included in the order.</u> The court may also
enter an order prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with any
animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child
residing in the household.  In addition, the court may enter an order directing
the possession of the animal and providing that the animal shall not be
disposed of prior to the disposition of the crime or offense.  The court may
enter an order prohibiting the defendant from possessing any firearm or other
weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and ordering the search for
and seizure of any such weapon at any location where the judge has reasonable
cause to believe the weapon is located.  The judge shall state with specificity
the reasons for and scope of the search and seizure authorized by the order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.   The written court order
releasing the defendant shall contain the court's directives specifically
restricting the defendant's ability to have contact with the victim, the
victim's friends, co-workers, or relatives, or any animal owned, possessed,
leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the
household.  The clerk of the court or other person designated by the court
shall provide a copy of this order to the victim forthwith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.   The victim's location shall
remain confidential and shall not appear on any documents or records to which
the defendant has access.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.   Before bail is set, the
defendant's prior record shall be considered by the court.  The court shall
also conduct a search of the domestic violence central registry.  Bail shall be
set as soon as is feasible, but in all cases within 24 hours of arrest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.   Once bail is set it shall
not be reduced without prior notice to the county prosecutor and the victim. 
Bail shall not be reduced by a judge other than the judge who originally
ordered bail, unless the reasons for the amount of the original bail are
available to the judge who reduces the bail and are set forth in the record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A victim shall not be
prohibited from applying for, and a court shall not be prohibited from issuing,
temporary restraints pursuant to this act because the victim has charged any
person with commission of a criminal act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2011, c.213, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 11 of P.L.1991,
c.261 (C.2C:25-27) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11.  a.  When a defendant is
found guilty of a crime or offense involving domestic violence and a condition
of sentence restricts the defendant's ability to have contact with the victim,
the victim's friends, co-workers, or relatives, or an animal owned, possessed,
leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the
household, that condition shall be recorded in an order of the court and a
written copy of that order shall be provided to the victim by the clerk of the
court or other person designated by the court.  <u>If the victim is pregnant,
at the victims request the court may order that the victims child shall,
immediately upon birth, be included in the order.</u>  In addition to
restricting a defendant's ability to have contact with the victim, the victim's
friends, co-workers, or relatives, or an animal owned, possessed, leased, kept,
or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household, the court
may require the defendant to receive professional counseling from either a
private source or a source appointed by the court, and if the court so orders,
the court shall require the defendant to provide documentation of attendance at
the professional counseling.  In any case where the court order contains a
requirement that the defendant receive professional counseling, no application
by the defendant to dissolve the restraining order shall be granted unless, in
addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions ordered by the
court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at such counseling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.   In addition the court may
enter an order directing the possession of an animal owned, possessed, leased,
kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the household. Where
a person has abused or threatened to abuse such animal, there shall be a
presumption that possession of the animal shall be awarded to the non-abusive

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.   (1)  When a defendant is
found guilty of a crime or offense involving domestic violence, the court shall
inform the defendant that the defendant is prohibited from purchasing, owning,
possessing, or controlling a firearm pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1979, c.179
(C.2C:39-7) and from receiving or retaining a firearms purchaser identification
card or permit to purchase a handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3.  The court
shall order the defendant to arrange for the immediate surrender to a law
enforcement officer of any firearm that has not already been seized or
surrendered and any firearms purchaser identification card or permit to
purchase a handgun possessed by the defendant.  No later than five business
days after the order is entered, however, the defendant may arrange to sell any
surrendered firearm to a licensed retail dealer of firearms who shall be
authorized to take possession of that purchased firearm from the law
enforcement agency to which it was surrendered no later than 10 business days
after the order is entered.  Any card or permit issued to the defendant shall
be deemed immediately revoked.  The court shall establish a process for
notifying the appropriate authorities of the conviction requiring the
revocation of the card or permit.  A law enforcement officer accepting a
surrendered firearm shall provide the defendant with a receipt listing the date
of surrender, the name of the defendant, and any item that has been
surrendered, including the serial number, manufacturer, and model of the
surrendered firearm.  The defendant shall provide a copy of this receipt to the
prosecutor within 48 hours of service of the order, and shall attest under
penalty that any firearms owned or possessed at the time of the order have been
transferred in accordance with this section and that the defendant currently
does not possess any firearms.  The defendant alternatively may attest under
penalty that he did not own or possess a firearm at the time of the order and
currently does not possess a firearm.  If the court, upon motion of the
prosecutor, finds probable cause that the defendant has failed to surrender any
firearm, card, or permit, the court may order a search for and removal of these
items at any location where the judge has reasonable cause to believe these
items are located.  The judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and
the scope of the search and seizure authorized by the order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A law enforcement
officer who receives a firearm that is surrendered, but not purchased and taken
possession of by a licensed retail dealer of firearms within 10 business days
of when the order is entered pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, may
dispose of the surrendered firearm in accordance with the provisions of
N.J.S.2C:64-6.  A firearm purchased by a licensed retail dealer from a
defendant shall become part of the inventory of the dealer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Section 13 of P.L.1991,
c.261 (C.2C:25-29) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     13.  a.  A hearing shall be
held in the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court within
10 days of the filing of a complaint pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-28)
in the county where the ex parte restraints were ordered, unless good cause is
shown for the hearing to be held elsewhere.  A copy of the complaint shall be
served on the defendant in conformity with the Rules of Court.  If a criminal
complaint arising out of the same incident which is the subject matter of a
complaint brought under P.L.1981, c.426 (C.2C:25-1 et seq.) or P.L.1991, c.261
(C.2C:25-17 et seq.) has been filed, testimony given by the plaintiff or
defendant in the domestic violence matter shall not be used in the simultaneous
or subsequent criminal proceeding against the defendant, other than domestic
violence contempt matters and where it would otherwise be admissible hearsay
under the rules of evidence that govern where a party is unavailable.  At the
hearing the standard for proving the allegations in the complaint shall be by a
preponderance of the evidence.  The court shall consider but not be limited to
the following factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The previous history of
domestic violence between the plaintiff and defendant, including threats,
harassment and physical abuse; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The existence of
immediate danger to person or property; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The financial
circumstances of the plaintiff and defendant; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The best interests of
the victim and any child; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   In determining custody
and parenting time the protection of the victim's safety; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The existence of a
verifiable order of protection from another jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An order issued under this act
shall only restrain or provide damages payable from a person against whom a
complaint has been filed under this act and only after a finding or an
admission is made that an act of domestic violence was committed by that
person.  The issue of whether or not a violation of this act occurred, including
an act of contempt under this act, shall not be subject to mediation or
negotiation in any form.  In addition, where a temporary or final order has
been issued pursuant to this act, no party shall be ordered to participate in
mediation on the issue of custody or parenting time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In proceedings in which
complaints for restraining orders have been filed, the court shall grant any
relief necessary to prevent further abuse.  In addition to any other
provisions, any restraining order issued by the court shall bar the defendant
from purchasing, owning, possessing or controlling a firearm and from receiving
or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a
handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3 during the period in which the restraining order
is in effect or two years, whichever is greater.  The order shall require the
immediate surrender of any firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant. 
The order shall include notice to the defendant of the penalties for a
violation of any provision of the order, including but not limited to the
penalties for contempt of court and unlawful possession of a firearm or other
weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A law enforcement officer
shall accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if
necessary, to any place where any firearm or other weapon belonging to the
defendant is located to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any
firearm or other weapon, and a law enforcement officer shall take custody of
any firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant.  If the order prohibits
the defendant from returning to the scene of domestic violence or other place
where firearms or other weapons belonging to the defendant are located, any
firearm or other weapon located there shall be seized by a law enforcement
officer.  The provisions of this subsection requiring the surrender or removal
of a firearm, card, or permit shall not apply to any law enforcement officer
while actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United
States or member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to
or from an authorized place of duty.  At the hearing the judge of the Family
Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court may issue an order granting
any or all of the following relief:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   An order restraining the
defendant from subjecting the victim to domestic violence, as defined in this
act.  </p>

exclusive possession to the plaintiff of the residence or household regardless
of whether the residence or household is jointly or solely owned by the parties
or jointly or solely leased by the parties.  This order shall not in any manner
affect title or interest to any real property held by either party or both
jointly.  If it is not possible for the victim to remain in the residence, the
court may order the defendant to pay the victim's rent at a residence other
than the one previously shared by the parties if the defendant is found to have
a duty to support the victim and the victim requires alternative housing.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   An order providing for
parenting time.  The order shall protect the safety and well-being of the
plaintiff and minor children and shall specify the place and frequency of
parenting time. Parenting time arrangements shall not compromise any other
remedy provided by the court by requiring or encouraging contact between the
plaintiff and defendant.  Orders for parenting time may include a designation
of a place of parenting time away from the plaintiff, the participation of a
third party, or supervised parenting time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The court shall consider
a request by a custodial parent who has been subjected to domestic violence by
a person with parenting time rights to a child in the parent's custody for an
investigation or evaluation by the appropriate agency to assess the risk of
harm to the child prior to the entry of a parenting time order.  Any denial of
such a request must be on the record and shall only be made if the judge finds
the request to be arbitrary or capricious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The court shall consider
suspension of the parenting time order and hold an emergency hearing upon an
application made by the plaintiff certifying under oath that the defendant's
access to the child pursuant to the parenting time order has threatened the safety
and well-being of the child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   An order requiring the
defendant to pay to the victim monetary compensation for losses suffered as a
direct result of the act of domestic violence.  The order may require the
defendant to pay the victim directly, to reimburse the Victims of Crime
Compensation Office for any and all compensation paid by the Victims of Crime
Compensation Office directly to or on behalf of the victim, and may require
that the defendant reimburse any parties that may have compensated the victim,
as the court may determine. Compensatory losses shall include, but not be
limited to, loss of earnings or other support, including child or spousal
support, out-of-pocket losses for injuries sustained, cost of repair or
replacement of real or personal property damaged or destroyed or taken by the
defendant, cost of counseling for the victim, moving or other travel expenses,
reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and compensation for pain and
suffering. Where appropriate, punitive damages may be awarded in addition to
compensatory damages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   An order requiring the
defendant to receive professional domestic violence counseling from either a
private source or a source appointed by the court and, in that event, requiring
the defendant to provide the court at specified intervals with documentation of
attendance at the professional counseling.  The court may order the defendant
to pay for the professional counseling.  No application by the defendant to
dissolve a final order which contains a requirement for attendance at
professional counseling pursuant to this paragraph shall be granted by the
court unless, in addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions
ordered by the court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at
such counseling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   An order restraining the
defendant from entering the residence, property, school, or place of employment
of the victim or of other family or household members of the victim and
requiring the defendant to stay away from any specified place that is named in
the order and is frequented regularly by the victim or other family or
household members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   An order restraining the
defendant from making contact with the plaintiff or others, including an order
forbidding the defendant from personally or through an agent initiating any
communication likely to cause annoyance or alarm including, but not limited to,
personal, written, or telephone contact with the victim or other family
members, or their employers, employees, or fellow workers, or others with whom
communication would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm to the victim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   An order requiring that
the defendant make or continue to make rent or mortgage payments on the
residence occupied by the victim if the defendant is found to have a duty to
support the victim or other dependent household members; provided that this
issue has not been resolved or is not being litigated between the parties in
another action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)    An order granting
either party temporary possession of specified personal property, such as an

document, a key, and other personal effects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  An order awarding
emergency monetary relief, including emergency support for minor children, to
the victim and other dependents, if any.  An ongoing obligation of support
shall be determined at a later date pursuant to applicable law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11)  An order awarding
temporary custody of a minor child.  The court shall presume that the best
interests of the child are served by an award of custody to the non-abusive
parent.</p>

a law enforcement officer accompany either party to the residence or any shared
business premises to supervise the removal of personal belongings in order to

P.L.1995, c.242).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (14)  An order granting any
other appropriate relief for the plaintiff and dependent children, provided
that the plaintiff consents to such relief, including relief requested by the
plaintiff at the final hearing, whether or not the plaintiff requested such
relief at the time of the granting of the initial emergency order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (15)  An order that requires
that the defendant report to the intake unit of the Family Part of the Chancery
Division of the Superior Court for monitoring of any other provision of the
order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (16)  In addition to the order
required by this subsection prohibiting the defendant from possessing any
firearm, the court may also issue an order prohibiting the defendant from
possessing any other weapon enumerated in subsection r. of N.J.S.2C:39-1 and
ordering the search for and seizure of any firearm or other weapon at any

defendant from stalking or following, or threatening to harm, to stalk or to
follow, the complainant or any other person named in the order in a manner
that, taken in the context of past actions of the defendant, would put the
complainant in reasonable fear that the defendant would cause the death or
injury of the complainant or any other person.  Behavior prohibited under this
act includes, but is not limited to, behavior prohibited under the provisions

that when a victim is pregnant, the court may provide that any protections ordered

(C.2C:25-17 et seq.) automatically apply to the victims child upon the birth
of the child.  The court, noting that the protections in a domestic violence
restraining order apply to the victims immediate family, stated there is
little sense in requiring the victim to have to return to court again
immediately after the birth of the child for an emergent hearing in order to
add the baby to her final restraining order.  <u>Id.</u> at 466.  The court
additionally noted that, for various reasons, a new parent may be either
unable or unwilling to immediately return to domestic violence court
immediately following childbirth.  <u>Id.</u> at 467. </p>
