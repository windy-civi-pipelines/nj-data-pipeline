Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Building service means work

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Building service contract
means a contract for the furnishing of building services, and includes any
subcontracts for those services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Building service employee
means any person employed to perform a building service who has been regularly
assigned to a building on a full or part-time basis for at least 90 days
immediately preceding any building service transfer or transition in employment
subject to this act, except for:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   persons who are
managerial, supervisory, or confidential employees, provided that this
exemption shall not apply to building superintendents or residential managers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   persons earning in
excess of $35 per hour from a covered employer, provided that this amount shall
be adjusted on January 1, 2017 and annually thereafter by the Department of
Labor and Workforce Development based upon the preceding 12-month percentage
increase, if any, in the consumer price index for all urban consumers for all
items, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States
Department of Labor; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   persons regularly
scheduled to work fewer than eight hours per week at a building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Building service transfer
means the termination of a building service contract, the transfer of the
controlling interest in any building in which building service employees are
employed, or the entering into a new building service contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Covered employer means any
person who hires or retains building service employees or a building service
contractor, including, but not limited to, a lessee of commercial space,
housing cooperative, condominium association, building managing agent, or any
other person who owns, leases, or manages real property, either on its own
behalf or for another person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Former building service
employer means any covered employer or any person who furnishes building
services pursuant to a building service contract prior to the termination of
that contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Person means any individual,
proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, corporation, limited liability
company, trust, association, or other entity that may employ persons or enter
into service contracts, but does not include any municipality or local
government, the State of New Jersey, the federal government or any other
governmental entity, or any individual or entity managing real property for a
governmental entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Successor building service
employer means any covered employer or building service contractor who
furnishes building services that are substantially similar to those that were
provided under a terminated building service contract or to those that were
provided by building service employees previously employed by a covered
employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  No less than 15
calendar days before any building service transfer, any former building service
employer shall provide to the successor building service employer a full and
accurate list containing the name, address, date of hire, and employment
classification of each building service employee employed at the buildings.  At
the same time that the former building service employer provides the list, the
former building service employer shall post the list in a notice to the
building service employees that sets forth the rights provided by this act, in
the same location and manner that other statutorily required notices to
employees are posted at the affected building.  The notice shall also be
provided to the employees collective bargaining representative, if applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Upon the transfer of any
building service, any successor building service employer shall retain those
building service employees employed at the building covered by the terminated
contract for a 90-day transition employment period. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If at any time the
successor building service employer determines that fewer building service
employees are required to perform building services at the affected building
than had been performing those services by the former building service
employer, the successor building service employer shall retain the building
service employees by seniority within job classification; provided, that during
the 90-day transition period, the successor building service employer shall
maintain a preferential hiring list of those building service employees not
retained at the building who shall be given a right of first refusal to any
jobs within their classifications that become available during that period. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Except as provided in
subsection c. of this section, during the 90-day transition period, the
successor building service employer shall not discharge without cause a
building service employee retained pursuant to this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     At the end of the
90-day transition period, the successor building service employer shall perform
a written performance evaluation for each employee retained pursuant to this
section.  If the employees performance during the 90-day transition period is
satisfactory, the successor building service employer shall offer the employee
continued employment under the terms and conditions established by the
successor building service employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Nothing in this act
shall be construed as prohibiting a successor building service employer from

letter-spacing:0pt'>      This bill </span>provides for a transition period of
90 days during which building service employees subject to certain building
service transfers must be retained, evaluated, and, if found satisfactory,
offered continued employment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines building
service as work performed in connection with the care or maintenance of an
existing building and includes, but is not limited to, work performed by a
watchman, guard, security officer, fire safety director, doorman, building
cleaner, porter, handyman, janitor, gardener, groundskeeper, stationary
fireman, elevator operator and starter, window cleaner, and superintendent. 
The bill applies to building service transfers, which include the termination
of a building service contract, the transfer of the controlling interest in any
building in which building service employees are employed, and the entering
into of a new building service contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that, no
less than 15 calendar days before any building service transfer, any former
building service employer shall provide to the successor building service
employer a full and accurate list containing the name, address, date of hire,
and employment classification of each building service employee employed at the
buildings.  At the same time that the former building service employer provides
the list, the former building service employer shall post the list in a notice
to the building service employees that sets forth the rights provided by this
bill, in the same location and manner that other statutorily required notices
to employees are posted at the affected building.  The notice shall also be
provided to the employees collective bargaining representative, if applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires any
successor building service employer, upon the transfer of any building service,
to retain those building service employees employed at the building covered by
the terminated contract for a 90-day transition employment period.  If at any
time the successor building service employer determines that fewer building
service employees are required to perform building services at the affected
building than had been performing those services by the former building service
employer, the successor building service employer shall retain the building
service employees by seniority within job classification; provided, that during
the 90-day transition period, the successor building service employer must
maintain a preferential hiring list of those building service employees not
retained at the building who are to be given a right of first refusal to any
jobs within their classifications that become available during that period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At the end of the 90-day
transition period, the bill requires the successor building service employer to
perform a written performance evaluation for each employee retained. If the
employees performance during the 90-day transition period is satisfactory, the
successor building service employer must offer the employee continued
employment under the terms and conditions established by the successor building
service employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A building service employee
who has been discharged or not retained in violation of the bill may bring an
action against a former or successor building service employer for violation of
any obligation imposed pursuant to the bill.  A court may order preliminary and
permanent equitable relief, including, but not limited to, reinstatement of any
employee who has been discharged or not retained in violation of the bill.  The
bill also provides for damages that may be imposed based on violations by
building service employers, including back pay, cost of benefits, and
reasonable attorneys fees and costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill does not apply to
any:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   building located in a
municipality with a population of less than 35,000;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   residential building
with less than 50 units;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   commercial office,
institutional, or retail building of less than 100,000 square feet; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   lessee of commercial
office space whose leasehold is less than 35,000 square feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill does not apply in
certain collective bargainingsituations, provided that the collective
bargaining agreement provides terms and conditions for the discharge or laying
off of employees.</p>
