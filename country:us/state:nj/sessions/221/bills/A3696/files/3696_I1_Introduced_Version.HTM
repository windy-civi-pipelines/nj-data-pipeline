(4)   The company shall disclose in the policy documentation and fulfillment materials whether the travel insurance is primary or secondary to other applicable coverage. (5)   Where travel insurance is marketed directly to a consumer through an insurers website or by others through an aggregator site, it shall not be an unfair trade practice or other violation of law where an accurate summary or short description of coverage is provided on the web page, so long as the consumer has access to the full provisions of the policy through electronic means. d.    No person offering, soliciting, or negotiating travel insurance or travel protection plans on an individual or group basis shall use a negative option or opt out, which would require a consumer to take an affirmative action to deselect coverage, such as unchecking a box on an electronic form, when the consumer purchases a trip. e.     It shall be an unfair trade practice, pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1947, c.379 (C.17:29B-3), to market blanket travel insurance coverage as free. f.     Where a consumers destination jurisdiction requires insurance coverage, it shall not be an unfair trade practice to require that a consumer choose between the following options as a condition of purchasing a trip or travel package: (1)   purchasing the coverage required by the destination jurisdiction through the travel retailer or limited lines travel insurance producer supplying the trip or travel package; or (2)   agreeing to obtain and provide proof of coverage that meets the destination jurisdictions requirements prior to departure. 8.    a.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of Title 17 of the Revised Statutes or Title 17B of the New Jersey Statutes, no person shall act or represent itself as a travel administrator for travel insurance in this State unless that person: (1) is a licensed property and casualty insurance producer in this state for activities permitted under that producer license; (2) holds a valid managing general agent license in this State; or (3) holds a valid third-party administrator license in this State. b.    An insurer is responsible for the acts of a travel administrator administering travel insurance underwritten by the insurer, and is responsible for ensuring that the travel administrator maintains all books and records relevant to the insurer to be made available by the travel administrator to the commissioner upon request. 9.    a.  Notwithstanding any other provision of Title 17 of the Revised Statutes or Title 17B of the New Jersey Statutes, travel insurance shall be classified and filed for purposes of rates and forms under an inland marine line of insurance, provided, however, that travel insurance that provides coverage for sickness, accident, disability or death occurring during travel, either exclusively, or in conjunction with related coverages of emergency evacuation or repatriation of remains, or incidental limited property and casualty benefits such as baggage or trip cancellation, may be filed under either an accident and health line of insurance or an inland marine line of insurance. b.    Travel Insurance may be in the form of an individual, group, or blanket policy. c.     Eligibility and underwriting standards for travel insurance may be developed and provided based on travel protection plans designed for individual or identified marketing or distribution channels, provided those standards also meet the States underwriting standards for inland marine. 10.  The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to effectuate the purposes of this act. 11.  This act shall take effect on the 90th day next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill, named the Travel Insurance Act, would replace and expand existing applicable regulatory standards by providing a comprehensive codification of the legal framework specific to travel insurance and travel-assistance services.  Specifically, the bill would: (1)   define operative terms relative to the licensing of travel insurance producers and the sale of travel insurance products and related services; (2)   establish a licensing and registration framework for limited lines travel insurance producers; (3)   impose the States existing requirements with respect to insurance premium tax on certain travel insurance premiums; and (4)   codify established practices with respect to how travel insurance and related products are sold, administered, and classified for purposes of rate and form regulation.

(4)   The company shall disclose in the policy documentation and fulfillment materials whether the travel insurance is primary or secondary to other applicable coverage. (5)   Where travel insurance is marketed directly to a consumer through an insurers website or by others through an aggregator site, it shall not be an unfair trade practice or other violation of law where an accurate summary or short description of coverage is provided on the web page, so long as the consumer has access to the full provisions of the policy through electronic means. d.    No person offering, soliciting, or negotiating travel insurance or travel protection plans on an individual or group basis shall use a negative option or opt out, which would require a consumer to take an affirmative action to deselect coverage, such as unchecking a box on an electronic form, when the consumer purchases a trip. e.     It shall be an unfair trade practice, pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1947, c.379 (C.17:29B-3), to market blanket travel insurance coverage as free. f.     Where a consumers destination jurisdiction requires insurance coverage, it shall not be an unfair trade practice to require that a consumer choose between the following options as a condition of purchasing a trip or travel package: (1)   purchasing the coverage required by the destination jurisdiction through the travel retailer or limited lines travel insurance producer supplying the trip or travel package; or (2)   agreeing to obtain and provide proof of coverage that meets the destination jurisdictions requirements prior to departure. 8.    a.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of Title 17 of the Revised Statutes or Title 17B of the New Jersey Statutes, no person shall act or represent itself as a travel administrator for travel insurance in this State unless that person: (1) is a licensed property and casualty insurance producer in this state for activities permitted under that producer license; (2) holds a valid managing general agent license in this State; or (3) holds a valid third-party administrator license in this State. b.    An insurer is responsible for the acts of a travel administrator administering travel insurance underwritten by the insurer, and is responsible for ensuring that the travel administrator maintains all books and records relevant to the insurer to be made available by the travel administrator to the commissioner upon request. 9.    a.  Notwithstanding any other provision of Title 17 of the Revised Statutes or Title 17B of the New Jersey Statutes, travel insurance shall be classified and filed for purposes of rates and forms under an inland marine line of insurance, provided, however, that travel insurance that provides coverage for sickness, accident, disability or death occurring during travel, either exclusively, or in conjunction with related coverages of emergency evacuation or repatriation of remains, or incidental limited property and casualty benefits such as baggage or trip cancellation, may be filed under either an accident and health line of insurance or an inland marine line of insurance. b.    Travel Insurance may be in the form of an individual, group, or blanket policy. c.     Eligibility and underwriting standards for travel insurance may be developed and provided based on travel protection plans designed for individual or identified marketing or distribution channels, provided those standards also meet the States underwriting standards for inland marine. 10.  The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to effectuate the purposes of this act. 11.  This act shall take effect on the 90th day next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill, named the Travel Insurance Act, would replace and expand existing applicable regulatory standards by providing a comprehensive codification of the legal framework specific to travel insurance and travel-assistance services.  Specifically, the bill would: (1)   define operative terms relative to the licensing of travel insurance producers and the sale of travel insurance products and related services; (2)   establish a licensing and registration framework for limited lines travel insurance producers; (3)   impose the States existing requirements with respect to insurance premium tax on certain travel insurance premiums; and (4)   codify established practices with respect to how travel insurance and related products are sold, administered, and classified for purposes of rate and form regulation.
