(4)  The company shall disclose in the policy documentation and fulfillment materials whether the travel insurance is primary or secondary to other applicable coverage. (5)  Where travel insurance is marketed directly to a consumer through an insurers website or by others through an aggregator site, it shall not be an unfair trade practice or other violation of law where an accurate summary or short description of coverage is provided on the web page 1that includes policy limits and exclusions or the ability to opt out of the coverage1, so long as the consumer has access to the full provisions of the policy through electronic means. d.   No person offering, soliciting, or negotiating travel insurance or travel protection plans on an individual or group basis shall use a negative option or opt out, which would require a consumer to take an affirmative action to deselect coverage, such as unchecking a box on an electronic form, when the consumer purchases a trip. e.   It shall be an unfair trade practice, pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1947, c.379 (C.17:29B-3), to market blanket travel insurance coverage as free. f.    Where a consumers destination jurisdiction requires insurance coverage, it shall not be an unfair trade practice to require that a consumer choose between the following options as a condition of purchasing a trip or travel package: (1)  purchasing the coverage required by the destination jurisdiction through the travel retailer or limited lines travel insurance producer supplying the trip or travel package; or (2)  agreeing to obtain and provide proof of coverage that meets the destination jurisdictions requirements prior to departure. 8.   a.
