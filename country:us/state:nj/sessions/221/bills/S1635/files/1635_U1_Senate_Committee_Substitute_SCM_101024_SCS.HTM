embalming, and supplementing P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.) and amending
various parts of the statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The statutory framework
for the licensure in funeral services dates back to the Mortuary Science Act,
P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.), in an era when New Jersey was very
different from the culturally and religiously diverse State that exists today,
when consumers had far less choice in all aspects of daily life, including
funerals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    While prior to the
enactment of the Mortuary Science Act, individuals had options to be licensed
as funeral directors, embalmers, or both, the law enacted in 1952 established a
unified licensing system, under which licensed funeral service professionals,
defined as practitioners of mortuary science, were to be proficient in both
funeral arts and funeral science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     While the current
licensing system serves the States traditional but declining demographic well,
for religious, cultural, environmental, and philosophical reasons, an
increasing number of funerals center around disposition without embalming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.     The existing licensing
system, requiring proficiency in embalming for licensure as a practitioner of
mortuary science, may be one of several reasons that discourage entry into funeral
service by<sup> </sup>persons who are reluctant to practice embalming but would
be eager to serve their communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The current multiple
tests and examinations required for licensure are also discouraging entry into
the field, by requiring an applicant to successfully complete studies and test
out of an approved program, then to be reassessed on a standardized nationally
recognized exam in funeral arts and sciences, then to successfully pass another
examination specific to New Jersey jurisprudence, and finally to demonstrate
embalming proficiency on human remains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     During the last several
years, particularly since the COVID 19 pandemic, there has been a shortage of mortuary
practitioners in New Jersey, a problem which, in part, could be remedied by
removing outmoded barriers to entering the profession.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Therefore, it is in the
public interest to revise the existing system of licensure to accommodate
religious, cultural, environmental, and philosophical beliefs more readily<sup>
</sup>as well as to promote consumer choice, by providing for, a delineation of
the all-encompassing licensure of practitioners of mortuary science into
Practitioner of Mortuary and Embalming Science and Practitioner of Mortuary
Science.<sup> </sup></p>
