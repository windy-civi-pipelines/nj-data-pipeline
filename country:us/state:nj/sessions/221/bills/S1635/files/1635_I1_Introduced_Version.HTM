<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning </span>the practice of funeral arranging and
supplementing P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.) and amending various parts of
the statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The statutory framework
for the licensure of funeral service professionals dates back almost 70 years
ago to the Mortuary Science Act, P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.), in an
era when New Jersey was very different from the culturally and religiously
diverse State that exists today, and when consumers had far less choice in all
aspects of daily life, including funeral arrangements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    While prior to the
enactment of the Mortuary Science Act, funeral service professionals had
options to be licensed as funeral directors, embalmers, or both, the law
enacted in 1952 established a unified licensing system, under which licensed
funeral service professionals, defined as practitioners of mortuary science,
must be proficient in both funeral directing, otherwise known as funeral arts,
and embalming, known as funeral science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     While the current
funeral professional licensing system serves the traditional but rapidly
disappearing New Jersey well, it has become abundantly clear that for
religious, cultural, environmental, and personal philosophy reasons, a steadily
increasing number of funerals center around cremation or burial without
embalming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The current funeral
professional licensing system does not recognize that some religions forbid
embalming prior to burial or cremation, an oversight that New Jerseys
flourishing diversity makes even more pronounced. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     A developing interest
in green burials incorporating environmentally-friendly measures into
end-of-life rituals may also reduce the prevalence of embalming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The existing funeral
professional licensing system, by requiring proficiency in embalming for
licensure as a funeral professional, discourages entry into the funeral services
profession of persons who are reluctant to practice embalming but would be
eager to serve their communities by arranging funerals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    During the last several
years, and particularly during the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, it has become
clear that there is a shortage of licensed funeral service professionals in New
Jersey, a problem which, in part, could be remedied by removing outmoded
barriers to entering the funeral services profession.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Therefore, it is in the
public interest to revise the existing system of funeral professional licensure
to more readily accommodate religious and cultural beliefs as well as to
promote consumer choice, by providing for, in addition to the current licensure
of practitioners of mortuary science, the licensure of funeral arrangers.       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 3 of P.L.1952,
c.340 (C.45:7-34) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>this act<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>P.L.1952,
c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.)</u>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   &quot;Board&quot; means
the State Board of Mortuary Science of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   &quot;Embalming&quot;
means the disinfecting or preservation of a dead human body, entirely or in
part by the use of chemical substances, fluids or gases in the body, or by
introduction of the same into the body by vascular or hypodermic injection, or
by direct application into the organs or cavities.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   &quot;Funeral
directing&quot; means (1) the engaging in or conducting or holding one's self
out as being engaged in or conducting the preparation (other than embalming)
for burial or disposal and the direction or supervision of burial or disposal
of dead human bodies; or (2) maintaining, using or operating a mortuary; or (3)
in connection with one's name or mortuary using the words &quot;mortician&quot;
or &quot;funeral director&quot; or &quot;undertaker&quot; or any other words or
title of like import or signification.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Funeral directing&quot;
also means the engaging in or making, or holding one's self out as being
engaged in or making, funeral arrangements, including at need funeral
arrangements or preneed funeral arrangements; or the offering or holding one's
self out as offering the opportunity to purchase or enroll in a prepaid funeral
agreement.  As used in this definition, &quot;funeral arrangements,&quot;
&quot;at need funeral arrangements,&quot; &quot;preneed funeral
arrangements&quot; and &quot;prepaid funeral agreement&quot; shall have the
same meaning as they are defined in section 1 of P.L.1993, c.147 (C.45:7-82).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   &quot;Mortuary
science&quot; means embalming and funeral directing, as the same are herein
defined.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends current law by
authorizing the State Board of Mortuary Science of New Jersey to license
funeral arrangers.  Unlike practitioners of mortuary science, who conduct both
funeral directing and embalming, funeral arrangers will not be allowed to
embalm but will be proficient in all aspects of funeral directing.  The
education, including continuing education, and examination requirements of the
law are modified to allow for this new category of licensure.  The bill does
not change the current requirements for a person to be licensed as a practitioner
of mortuary science.  That class of licensure is still required to be
proficient in both funeral directing and embalming. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The funeral directing industry
is regulated, in large part, by the nearly-70 year old Mortuary Science Act,
(P.L.1952, c.340).  Prior to the enactment of the 1952 law, the industry was
regulated pursuant to P.L.1927, c.156 (repealed effectively in 1952).  Under
the 1927 law, the licensing board was directed to issue three separate licenses:
one for embalming, one for funeral directing, and a third for both embalming
and funeral directing.  The 1952 law consolidated the three licenses into one,
issuing thereafter a license for a practitioner of mortuary science, who must
be proficient in both embalming and funeral directing.       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For religious, cultural,
environmental, and other personal and philosophical reasons, individuals often
choose cremation or burial without embalming as an alternative to burial with
embalming.  Over the last several decades, the percentage of funeral services
not requiring embalming has increased.  This bill, by allowing funeral services
not involving embalming to be provided by persons licensed by the board who are
not embalmers, would facilitate the response by the funeral services industry
to New Jerseys diverse population and to societal changes.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As defined in the bill,
funeral arranging means funeral directing, which includes (1) holding one's
self out as being engaged in or conducting the preparation (other than
embalming) for burial or disposal and the direction or supervision of burial or
disposal of dead human bodies;  (2) maintaining, using or operating a mortuary;
(3) in connection with one's name or mortuary using the words
&quot;mortician&quot; or &quot;funeral director&quot; or &quot;undertaker&quot;
