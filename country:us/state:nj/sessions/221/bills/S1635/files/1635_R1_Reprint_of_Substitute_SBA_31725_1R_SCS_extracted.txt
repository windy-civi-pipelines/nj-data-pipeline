S1635 1R SCS [First Reprint] SENATE COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE FOR SENATE, No. 1635 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE ADOPTED OCTOBER 10, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator ANDREW ZWICKER District 16 (Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset) Senator NELLIE POU District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) Co-Sponsored by: Senators Singer and Wimberly SYNOPSIS Modifies regulation of mortuary science and establishes oversight of mortuary and embalming science. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on March 17, 2025, with amendments. An Act concerning the practice of funeral directing and embalming, and supplementing P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.) and amending various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The statutory framework for the licensure in funeral services dates back to the Mortuary Science Act, P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.), in an era when New Jersey was very different from the culturally and religiously diverse State that exists today, when consumers had far less choice in all aspects of daily life, including funerals. b.    While prior to the enactment of the Mortuary Science Act, individuals had options to be licensed as funeral directors, embalmers, or both, the law enacted in 1952 established a unified licensing system, under which licensed funeral service professionals, defined as practitioners of mortuary science, were to be proficient in both funeral arts and funeral science. c.     While the current licensing system serves the States traditional but declining demographic well, for religious, cultural, environmental, and philosophical reasons, an increasing number of funerals center around disposition without embalming. d. The existing licensing system, requiring proficiency in embalming for licensure as a practitioner of mortuary science, may be one of several reasons that discourage entry into funeral service by persons who are reluctant to practice embalming but would be eager to serve their communities. e.     The current multiple tests and examinations required for licensure are also discouraging entry into the field, by requiring an applicant to successfully complete studies and test out of an approved program, then to be reassessed on a standardized nationally recognized exam in funeral arts and sciences, then to successfully pass another examination specific to New Jersey jurisprudence, and finally to demonstrate embalming proficiency on human remains. f.     During the last several years, particularly since the COVID 19 pandemic, there has been a shortage of mortuary practitioners in New Jersey, a problem which, in part, could be remedied by removing outmoded barriers to entering the profession. g.    Therefore, it is in the public interest to revise the existing system of licensure to accommodate religious, cultural, environmental, and philosophical beliefs more readily as well as to promote consumer choice, by providing for, a delineation of the all-encompassing licensure of practitioners of mortuary science into Practitioner of Mortuary and Embalming Science and Practitioner of Mortuary Science. 2.    Section 3 of P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-34) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in [this act] P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.): (a)   "Board" means the State Board of Mortuary Science of New Jersey. (b)   "Embalming" means the disinfecting or preservation of a dead human body, entirely or in part by the use of chemical substances, fluids or gases in the body, or by introduction of the same into the body by vascular or hypodermic injection, or by direct application into the organs or cavities. (c)   "Funeral directing" means (1) the engaging in or conducting or holding one's self out as being engaged in or conducting the preparation (other than embalming) for burial or disposal and the direction or supervision of burial or disposal of dead human bodies; or (2) maintaining, using or operating a mortuary; or (3) in connection with one's name or mortuary using the words "mortician" or "funeral director" or "undertaker" or any other words or title of like import or signification. "Funeral directing" also means the engaging in or making, or holding one's self out as being engaged in or making, funeral arrangements, including at need funeral arrangements or preneed funeral arrangements; or the offering or holding one's self out as offering the opportunity to purchase or enroll in a prepaid funeral agreement.  As used in this definition, "funeral arrangements," "at need funeral arrangements," "preneed funeral arrangements" and "prepaid funeral agreement" shall have the same meaning as they are defined in section 1 of P.L.1993, c.147 (C.45:7-82). (d)   "Mortuary and embalming science" means embalming and funeral directing, as the same are herein defined. (e)   ["Embalmer" means a qualified person who practices or engages in embalming, as the same is herein defined] Mortuary science means funeral directing as the same is herein defined. (f)   ["Funeral director" includes "undertaker" and "mortician" and means a qualified person who practices or engages in funeral directing, as the same is herein defined. (g)]  "Practitioner of mortuary and embalming science" means a qualified person who practices or engages in mortuary and embalming science, as the same is herein defined and who (1) shall be licensed under the provisions of [this act] P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.) as a practitioner of mortuary and embalming science, or (2) holds a license as both an embalmer and a funeral director under the provisions of any prior law or laws of this State, or (3) holds a license as an embalmer under the provisions of any prior law or laws of this State and shall have been licensed under the provisions of section 21 of P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-52) as a funeral director, or (4) holds a license as a funeral director under the provisions of any prior law or laws of this State and shall have been licensed under the provisions of section 21 of P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-52) as an embalmer. (g)   Practitioner of mortuary science means a person who practices or engages in funeral directing and is licensed pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.). (h)   "Mortuary" means any place or premises devoted to or used in the care and preparation for burial, disposition, or transportation of dead human bodies, or any specifically designated location or address where any person or persons shall hold forth that he, she, or they are engaged in the practice of mortuary science, embalming or funeral directing, and shall mean and include any premises of any kind whatsoever in which mortuary science in any of its branches is practiced or in which more than five funerals may be conducted in any calendar year, except publicly owned buildings, places of worship and meeting places of fraternal organizations. (i)    "Registered [trainee] intern" means a person who is duly registered with the board and who is engaged in the State of New Jersey in learning to practice as a practitioner of mortuary and embalming science or as a practitioner of mortuary science under the personal instruction and supervision of a person duly licensed as a practitioner of mortuary and embalming science or as a practitioner of mortuary science, as appropriate, and who has an annual case volume as hereinafter provided in section 18 of [this act] P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-49).  A person seeking licensure as a practitioner of mortuary science may learn to practice as a registered intern in mortuary science from a licensed practitioner in mortuary and embalming science, provided that such training solely focuses on funeral directing.

S1635 1R SCS [First Reprint] SENATE COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE FOR SENATE, No. 1635 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE ADOPTED OCTOBER 10, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator ANDREW ZWICKER District 16 (Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset) Senator NELLIE POU District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) Co-Sponsored by: Senators Singer and Wimberly SYNOPSIS Modifies regulation of mortuary science and establishes oversight of mortuary and embalming science. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on March 17, 2025, with amendments. An Act concerning the practice of funeral directing and embalming, and supplementing P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.) and amending various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The statutory framework for the licensure in funeral services dates back to the Mortuary Science Act, P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.), in an era when New Jersey was very different from the culturally and religiously diverse State that exists today, when consumers had far less choice in all aspects of daily life, including funerals. b.    While prior to the enactment of the Mortuary Science Act, individuals had options to be licensed as funeral directors, embalmers, or both, the law enacted in 1952 established a unified licensing system, under which licensed funeral service professionals, defined as practitioners of mortuary science, were to be proficient in both funeral arts and funeral science. c.     While the current licensing system serves the States traditional but declining demographic well, for religious, cultural, environmental, and philosophical reasons, an increasing number of funerals center around disposition without embalming. d. The existing licensing system, requiring proficiency in embalming for licensure as a practitioner of mortuary science, may be one of several reasons that discourage entry into funeral service by persons who are reluctant to practice embalming but would be eager to serve their communities. e.     The current multiple tests and examinations required for licensure are also discouraging entry into the field, by requiring an applicant to successfully complete studies and test out of an approved program, then to be reassessed on a standardized nationally recognized exam in funeral arts and sciences, then to successfully pass another examination specific to New Jersey jurisprudence, and finally to demonstrate embalming proficiency on human remains. f.     During the last several years, particularly since the COVID 19 pandemic, there has been a shortage of mortuary practitioners in New Jersey, a problem which, in part, could be remedied by removing outmoded barriers to entering the profession. g.    Therefore, it is in the public interest to revise the existing system of licensure to accommodate religious, cultural, environmental, and philosophical beliefs more readily as well as to promote consumer choice, by providing for, a delineation of the all-encompassing licensure of practitioners of mortuary science into Practitioner of Mortuary and Embalming Science and Practitioner of Mortuary Science. 2.    Section 3 of P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-34) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in [this act] P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.): (a)   "Board" means the State Board of Mortuary Science of New Jersey. (b)   "Embalming" means the disinfecting or preservation of a dead human body, entirely or in part by the use of chemical substances, fluids or gases in the body, or by introduction of the same into the body by vascular or hypodermic injection, or by direct application into the organs or cavities. (c)   "Funeral directing" means (1) the engaging in or conducting or holding one's self out as being engaged in or conducting the preparation (other than embalming) for burial or disposal and the direction or supervision of burial or disposal of dead human bodies; or (2) maintaining, using or operating a mortuary; or (3) in connection with one's name or mortuary using the words "mortician" or "funeral director" or "undertaker" or any other words or title of like import or signification. "Funeral directing" also means the engaging in or making, or holding one's self out as being engaged in or making, funeral arrangements, including at need funeral arrangements or preneed funeral arrangements; or the offering or holding one's self out as offering the opportunity to purchase or enroll in a prepaid funeral agreement.  As used in this definition, "funeral arrangements," "at need funeral arrangements," "preneed funeral arrangements" and "prepaid funeral agreement" shall have the same meaning as they are defined in section 1 of P.L.1993, c.147 (C.45:7-82). (d)   "Mortuary and embalming science" means embalming and funeral directing, as the same are herein defined. (e)   ["Embalmer" means a qualified person who practices or engages in embalming, as the same is herein defined] Mortuary science means funeral directing as the same is herein defined. (f)   ["Funeral director" includes "undertaker" and "mortician" and means a qualified person who practices or engages in funeral directing, as the same is herein defined. (g)]  "Practitioner of mortuary and embalming science" means a qualified person who practices or engages in mortuary and embalming science, as the same is herein defined and who (1) shall be licensed under the provisions of [this act] P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.) as a practitioner of mortuary and embalming science, or (2) holds a license as both an embalmer and a funeral director under the provisions of any prior law or laws of this State, or (3) holds a license as an embalmer under the provisions of any prior law or laws of this State and shall have been licensed under the provisions of section 21 of P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-52) as a funeral director, or (4) holds a license as a funeral director under the provisions of any prior law or laws of this State and shall have been licensed under the provisions of section 21 of P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-52) as an embalmer. (g)   Practitioner of mortuary science means a person who practices or engages in funeral directing and is licensed pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-32 et seq.). (h)   "Mortuary" means any place or premises devoted to or used in the care and preparation for burial, disposition, or transportation of dead human bodies, or any specifically designated location or address where any person or persons shall hold forth that he, she, or they are engaged in the practice of mortuary science, embalming or funeral directing, and shall mean and include any premises of any kind whatsoever in which mortuary science in any of its branches is practiced or in which more than five funerals may be conducted in any calendar year, except publicly owned buildings, places of worship and meeting places of fraternal organizations. (i)    "Registered [trainee] intern" means a person who is duly registered with the board and who is engaged in the State of New Jersey in learning to practice as a practitioner of mortuary and embalming science or as a practitioner of mortuary science under the personal instruction and supervision of a person duly licensed as a practitioner of mortuary and embalming science or as a practitioner of mortuary science, as appropriate, and who has an annual case volume as hereinafter provided in section 18 of [this act] P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-49).  A person seeking licensure as a practitioner of mortuary science may learn to practice as a registered intern in mortuary science from a licensed practitioner in mortuary and embalming science, provided that such training solely focuses on funeral directing. (cf: P.L.1993, c.147, s.14) 3.    Section 4 of P.L.1952, c.340 (C.45:7-35) is amended to read as follows: 4.    There is hereby created in the Division of Consumer Affairs  in the Department of Law and Public Safety a State Board of Mortuary Science of New Jersey, which board shall consist of 13 members as follows: two shall be public members and one shall be a State executive department member appointed pursuant to the provisions of [P.L.1971, c.60 (C.45:2.1 et seq.)] section 2 of P.L.1971, c.60 (C.45:1-2.2); eight members, each of whom shall be a citizen  of the United States and a resident of the State of New Jersey, duly licensed as a practitioner of mortuary and embalming science or as a practitioner of mortuary science, as appropriate, and shall have had a minimum of five consecutive years of experience and practice as a practitioner of mortuary science in this State immediately preceding his appointment; and two additional public members, one of whom shall be 62 years of age or older.
