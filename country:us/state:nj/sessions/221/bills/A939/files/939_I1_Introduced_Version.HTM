of the total distributive income or gain of the partnership for its taxable
year ending within or with the taxpayers taxable year except as otherwise
provided by law. A qualified small business that is a New Jersey S Corporation

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides credits
against the New Jersey gross income tax to support the development of certain
New Jersey-based small business start-ups.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, taxpayers that
meet the definition of a qualified small business are allowed gross income tax
credits that can be taken to reduce the taxpayers liability for tax during the
first, second, and third taxable years in which the business is conducted or
operated for a profit by the taxpayer. The bill provides that the amount of
credit permitted to be taken is determined based upon a fixed percentage of the
taxpayers New Jersey gross income tax liability incurred and required to be
paid in connection with the conduct or operation of the qualified small
business. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
fixed percentage of the credit is weighted in favor of tax liabilities incurred
during the first few years of profitability. The bill specifies that in the
first taxable year the business is conducted or operated for a profit, the
taxpayer is allowed a credit equal to 75 percent of the New Jersey gross income
tax liability that is incurred and required to be paid in connection with the
conduct or operation of the qualified small business. In the second year of
profitability, the credit is equal to 50 percent of the tax liability incurred
and required to be paid in connection with the conduct or operation of the
business. In the third year, the credit is 25 percent of the tax liability
incurred and required to be paid in connection with the business.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill limits the
application of the allowable credits to the tax otherwise due and required to
be paid for the taxable year to which the credit applies. This means, for
example, that a credit allowed for tax liabilities incurred in connection with
the conduct or operation of a qualified small business during the second
taxable year in which the business is conducted or operated for a profit can
only be taken to reduce the tax liabilities required to be paid by the taxpayer
during the second taxable year the business is profitable; the credit cannot be
carried back or carried forward to reduce a past or future tax liability.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes a
mandatory pre-approval process in connection with the credits. The bill
provides that taxpayers seeking a credit to offset a tax liability incurred and
required to be paid in connection with the conduct or operation of a qualified
small business must make and file an application with the Director of the
Division of Taxation to obtain the directors written authorization prior to
taking the allowable credit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes the
director to establish an application process and prescribe the form and manner
through which a taxpayer may make and file an application to obtain the
directors authorization for the credit, but stipulates that the taxpayer must
demonstrate that the qualified small business (for which the taxpayer is
seeking a credit) is unrelated to the conduct or operation of any other
business that was, or is currently, conducted or operated by the taxpayer or,
if the qualified small business and any other business that was, or is
currently, conducted or operated by the taxpayer are related, that the
qualified small business was not established or acquired for the purpose of
enjoying the benefit of the credit. The bill provides that taxpayer
applications are deemed approved and written authorizations are deemed issued
if the director fails to make a determination regarding the approval of an
application within 90 calendar days of the date a complete application is
received or if the director fails to issue a written authorization within five
calendar days of the date the determination is made.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes the
director to adopt rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the purposes of
the bill, and allows for the immediate filing of those rules and regulations
with the Office of Administrative Law, effective for a period not exceeding 360
calendar days following the bills effective date. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill takes effect
immediately and applies to tax liabilities incurred and required to be paid in
connection with qualified small businesses first conducted or operated for a
profit in taxable years beginning on or after January 1 next following the date
of enactment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For purposes of the bill, a
qualified small business is a business that:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     -- is registered to do
business in this State, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     -- maintains a business
location or otherwise derives a majority of its income from business activities
or operations conducted within this State, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     -- has no more than 50
employees in any calendar month during the first taxable year in which the
business is conducted or operated for a profit by the taxpayer, and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     -- has net income of not more
than $100,000 from all business activities or operations conducted within and
without this State during the first taxable year in which the business is
conducted or operated for a profit by the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of this bill is to
support the development of start-up small businesses that are based in New
  Jersey. The credit provided by the bill will significantly reduce the tax
liabilities associated with the conduct or operation of small businesses during
the first few years of profitability, and provide small business owners with
the opportunity to reinvest additional resources back into their businesses
during the most critical period in the life of any small business. </p>
