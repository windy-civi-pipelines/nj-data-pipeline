<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     1. The Legislature finds and declares that it is
the public policy of the State to promote and encourage the continuing economic
development of minority and women-owned businesses, that minority and
women-owned businesses participate in the State procurement process, and that
the State procurement process operate and award contracts in a manner that is
free from bias against minority and women-owned businesses that are ready, willing,
and able to engage in business with the State. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     a.     In January 2024, a New Jersey Disparity
Study was conducted on the availability and utilization of small, minority,
women, and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses and their experience in
the State procurement process.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     The disparity study found the following:</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     (1)   For formal construction prime contracts,
minority and women-owned businesses received 4 percent of prime contract
dollars.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     (2)   For formal professional services prime
contracts, minority and women-owned businesses received 15 percent of prime
contract dollars. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     (3)   For formal goods and services prime
contracts, minority and women-owned businesses received 10 percent of prime
contract dollars. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     (4)   Across all types of informal prime
contracts, meaning a contract where the value fell below the dollar threshold
where a public bid is required, minority and women-owned businesses received 10
percent of prime contract dollars. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     (5)   For construction subcontracts, minority

style='font-style:normal'>     (6)   For professional services subcontracts,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     b.    The disparity study determined that
minority and women-owned businesses are capable of fulfilling large State
contracts if and when they are awarded the contracts and there are measurable
differences for minority and women-owned businesses across all types of
contracts.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     c.     The Legislature further finds that, in
order to redress the disparities found by the New Jersey Disparity Study, it is
necessary for the State to implement a program that requires a good faith
effort towards goals to use certified minority and women-owned businesses as
prime contractors and subcontractors.  The Legislature further finds that it is
in the best interest of the economic development of the State to promote and
encourage the continuing economic development of minority and women-owned
businesses.</span></span></p>

receiving notification of such deficiencies from the contracting agency.  When
failure to remedy any notified deficiency in the utilization plan is a ground

requirements setting forth the reasons for such contractors inability to meet
any or all of the participation requirements together with an explanation of
the efforts undertaken by the contractor to obtain the required minority and

be performed and the project size and term.  If, based on such considerations,
the contracting agency determines there is not a reasonable availability of
contractors on the list of certified business to furnish services for the
project, it shall issue a waiver of compliance to the contractor.  In making
such determination, the contracting agency shall first consider the

have been included to comply with the provisions of this act or of a contractor
that a contracting agency has violated such provisions or has failed or refused
to issue a waiver where one has been applied for pursuant to subdivision h. of
section 4 of this act, <span class=BillLanguage><span style='font-style:normal'>P.L. 
, c.  (C.  ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill</span></span>), or
has denied such application, the Chief Diversity Officer shall attempt to
resolve the matter giving rise to such complaint.  If efforts to resolve such
matter to the satisfaction of all parties are unsuccessful, the Chief Diversity
Officer shall refer the matter, within 30 days of the receipt of the complaint,
to the Department of the Treasurys hearing officers.  Upon conclusion of the
administrative hearing, the hearing officer shall submit to the Chief Diversity
Officer their decision regarding the alleged violation of the contract and
recommendations regarding the imposition of sanctions, fines or penalties.  The
Chief Diversity Officer, within 10 days of receipt of the decision, shall file
a determination of such matter and shall cause a copy of such determination
along with a copy of this act to be served upon the contractor by personal
service or by certified mail return receipt requested.  The decision of the
hearing officer shall be reviewable by a court of competent jurisdiction in
this State.  The penalties imposed for any violation which is premised upon
either a fraudulent or intentional misrepresentation by the contractor or the
contractors willful and intentional disregard of the minority and women-owned
participation requirement included in the contract may include a determination
that the contractor shall be ineligible to submit a bid to any contracting agency
or be awarded any such contract for a period not to exceed one year following
the final determination; provided however, if a contractor has previously been
determined to be ineligible to submit a bid pursuant to this section, the
penalties imposed for any subsequent violation, if such violation occurs within
five years of the first violation, may include a determination that the contractor
shall be ineligible to submit a bid to any contracting agency or be awarded any
such contract for a period not to exceed five years following the final
determination.  The Chief Diversity Officer shall maintain a website listing
all contractors that have been deemed ineligible to submit a bid pursuant to
this section and the date after which each contractor shall once again become
eligible to submit bids.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7. This act shall take effect
on the 120th day following the date of enactment, except that the Department of
the Treasury may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as

on December 31, 2029, unless extended by the Legislature upon sufficient
findings of cause in the report completed pursuant to section 3 of this act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires State
agencies to make a good faith effort towards goals to use certified minority
and women-owned businesses as prime contractors and subcontractors in the State
procurement process. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In January 2024, a New Jersey
Disparity Study was conducted on the <span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>availability and utilization of small, minority,
women, and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses and their experience in
the State procurement process.  Across all types of contracts, minority and
women-owned businesses received about 10 percent of prime contract dollars and
about 36 percent of subcontract dollars.  The study determined that minority
and women-owned businesses are capable of fulfilling large State contracts if
they were to be awarded the contracts and there are measurable differences for
minority and women-owned businesses across all types of contracts.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     Under this bill, the Chief Diversity Officer is
required to recommission the statewide disparity study regarding the
participation of minority and women-owned businesses in State contracts.  The
study and its findings must be completed by August 15, 2029.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     Each State agency is required to structure
procurement procedures for contracts made directly or indirectly to minority
and women-owned businesses </span></span><span style='line-height:150%'>to
attempt good faith effort towards increased utilization of minority and
women-owned businesses with regard to total annual statewide procurement across
all types of contracts.  Each agency is also required to develop and adopt
agency specific goals based on the findings of the most recent disparity study
and must be consistent with the findings of the disparity study. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%'>     The
bill requires each contractor to develop a utilization plan on the use of
minority and women-owned businesses as subcontractors during the bidding process. 
The bill also establishes a waiver procedure for contractors who have made a
good faith effort to comply with the minority and women-owned business
participation requirements.  The bill establishes a complaint procedure for
State agencies who have reason to believe that a good faith effort was not made
by the contractor. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%'>     The
bill contains a sunset provision and will expire on December 31, 2029 if the
required recommissioned disparity study does not indicate a measurable
disparity for minority and women-owned businesses in the State contract
procurement process. </span></p>
