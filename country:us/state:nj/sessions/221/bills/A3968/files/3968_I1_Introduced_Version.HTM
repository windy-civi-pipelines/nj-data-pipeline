<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of the
State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  On May 25, 2023, the
United States Supreme Court issued a decision in a case before it, <u>Tyler v.
Hennepin County, Minnesota, et al.</u>, 143 S. Ct. 1369 (2023), that has very
important implications for the rights of all property owners, and specifically,
New Jersey law governing property taxes on real property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Ms. Geraldine Tyler owned a
condominium in Hennepin County, Minnesota on which accumulated approximately
$15,000 in unpaid real estate taxes, interest, and penalties.  The county
seized the condominium and sold it for $40,000.  Instead of returning the
excess $25,000 from the sale to Ms. Tyler, the county kept the money for itself
as permitted by that states law.  Ms. Tyler filed suit, alleging that the
county unconstitutionally retained the excess value of her condominium beyond
the $15,000 tax debt in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment
to the United States Constitution, as well as the Excessive Fines Clause of the
Eighth Amendment.  In an opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts for a
unanimous Court, the Court found that Ms. Tyler had plausibly alleged a taking
under the Fifth Amendment.  Since Ms. Tyler agreed that relief under the
Takings Clause would fully remedy her harm, the Court did not decide whether
she also alleged an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment.  However, the
acknowledgement that Ms. Tyler had plausibly alleged a taking under the Fifth
Amendment has the effect of limiting what a lienholder can collect when a court
forecloses the right of redemption of a lien on the lienholders behalf to only
the property taxes paid by the lienholder, plus interest.  In the words of
Chief Justice Roberts, (t)he taxpayer must render unto Caesar what is
Caesars, but no more.  In this case, the party that kept the excess funds was
a public entity, not a private lienholder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     On December 4, 2023, the New
Jersey Appellate Division court issued its decision in <u>257-261 20<sup>th</sup>
Avenue Realty, LLC v. Alessandro Roberto, et al.</u>, finding that New Jerseys
tax sale law, which established the confiscation of a property owners equity
when a tax lien on a property is foreclosed, violates the Takings Clause of the
Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as determined in the <u>Tyler</u>
case, and also approved the retroactive application of the decision to any
foreclosure case pending final judgment to account for the new principle of law
established in <u>Tyler</u> (The Appellate Division court referred to this as
pipeline retroactivity).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  New Jerseys tax sale
law, R.S.54:5-1 et seq., allows the holder of a tax sale certificate, whether
it is a municipality or a private lienholder, the ability to foreclose the
right of the property owner to redeem the lien by paying to the tax sale
certificate holder all of the property taxes, plus interest, that the holder of
the tax sale certificate paid to the municipality.  Under R.S.54:5-86, an
action to foreclose the right of redemption of a tax lien is filed with the
Superior Court.  Under R.S.54:5-87, as part of the action to foreclose the
right of redemption, the court has the authority to adjudge an absolute and
indefeasible estate of inheritance in fee simple, to be vested in the
purchaser.  In other words, the Superior Court is authorized to grant title of
the property to the lienholder, without requiring the lienholder to return the
excess equity in the property to the prior owner.  This authority applies to
both municipalities, as lienholders, as well as to private lienholders.  The
language of R.S.54:5-85 reinforces this authority of the Superior Court: 
[t]he provisions of this article shall be liberally construed as remedial
legislation to encourage the barring of the right of redemption by actions in
the Superior Court to the end that marketable titles may thereby be secured. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The New Jersey
Constitution expressly extends property rights protections to actions taken by
private parties.  Article I, paragraph 20 of the constitution provides that private
property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.  That
paragraph goes on to provide that (i)ndividuals or private corporations shall
not be authorized to take private property for public use without just compensation
first made to the owners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  Case law reinforces the
provisions of Article I, paragraph 20.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  In <u>Hyde v. Somerset
Air Service, Inc.</u>, 1 N.J. Super.<span style='color:#1F497D'> </span><span
style='color:black'>346, 349-350 (Ch. Div. 1948), the court stated that . . .
in such cases it is a question of whats what rather than whos who.  Indeed,
the Legislature or governmental agencies cannot constitutionally confer upon
individuals or private corporations, acting primarily for their own profit,
although for public benefit as well, any right to deprive persons of the lawful
enjoyment of their property.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     (2) 
In <u>Oechsle v. Ruhl</u>, 140 N.J. Eq. 355, 360 (Ch. 1947), the court stated
that [a]n act of the legislature cannot confer any right upon an individual to
deprive persons of the ordinary enjoyment of their property without just
compensation.  This principle rests upon the express terms of the constitution
which created such a prohibition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     (3) 
In<u> Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. Angel</u>, 41 N.J. Eq. 316 (1886), the court
stated that [a]n act of the legislature cannot confer upon individuals or
private corporations, acting primarily for their own profit, although for
public benefit as well, any right to deprive persons of the ordinary enjoyment
of their property, except upon condition that just compensation be first made
to the owners.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     (4) 
In <u>Tide-Water Company v. Coster</u>, 18 N.J. Eq. 518 (1866), the court
stated that [t]he legislative power is not competent to take the property of A
and transfer it to B, simply for the benefit or convenience of B, because such
an act has no public aspect; it concerns and affects, exclusively, the two
individuals.  In such case, it would be within the authority of the judiciary
to pronounce such transfer unconstitutional and void.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     In
each of these cases, the court reinforced the principle espoused in Article I,
paragraph 20 of the New Jersey Constitution that </span>(i)ndividuals or
private corporations shall not be authorized to take private property for
public use without just compensation first made to the owners.  The taking of
the entirety of a property owners equity in a parcel of real estate because
that property owner was delinquent in the payment of property taxes
attributable to the parcel of real property would appear to violate Article I,
paragraph 20 of New Jerseys Constitution as well as the Fifth Amendment of the
United States Constitution based on the reasoning set forth in <u>Tyler v.
Hennepin County, Minnesota, et. al.</u>.  Therefore, the Legislature has the
authority, and a legal obligation to end this practice, which has become
colloquially known and referred to as equity theft, and to require that any
excess equity in a parcel of real property that has been the subject of an
action in court to foreclose the right of redemption of a tax lien be returned
to the former property owner after the lienholder has been reimbursed for
property taxes paid, and interest due and owing, on the property during the period
in which the lienholder held the tax lien.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  Therefore, in order to
protect the equity of every property owner who may fall behind on their
property taxes, whether the tax lien is held by a municipality or by a private
lienholder, the Legislature has determined that, in light of the Supreme
Courts decision in <u>Tyler v. Hennepin County, Minnesota, et al.</u>, the tax
sale law shall be amended and supplemented in order to require that all equity
remaining after a lienholder, who has foreclosed the right of redemption of a
tax lien, has been reimbursed for property taxes paid, plus interest, shall be
returned to the delinquent property owner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises New Jerseys
tax lien foreclosure laws to comply with the United States Supreme Courts
decision in <u>Tyler v. Hennepin County, Minnesota, et al.</u>, 143 S. Ct. 1369
(2023), and the New Jersey Appellate Division court decision in <u>257-261 20<sup>th</sup>
Avenue Realty, LLC v. Alessandro Roberto, et al.,</u> A-3315-21 (December 4,
2023).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      In the Tyler decision, the
Supreme Court concluded that the taking of the entirety of a property owners
equity in a parcel of real estate because that property owner was delinquent in
the payment of property taxes attributable to the parcel of real property
violates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution.  In the <u>Roberto</u> decision, the Appellate Division found
that New Jerseys tax sale law, which established the confiscation of a
property owners equity when a tax lien on a property is foreclosed, violates
the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as
determined in the <u>Tyler</u> case, and also approved the retroactive
application of the decision to any foreclosure case pending final judgment to
account for the new principle of law established in <u>Tyler</u> (The Appellate
Division court referred to this as pipeline retroactivity).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to address the <u>Tyler</u>
and <u>Roberto</u> decisions, the bill provides that notwithstanding any
provision of the tax sale law, R.S.54:5-1 et seq., or the In Rem Tax
Foreclosure Act, 1948, P.L.1948, c.96 (C.54:5-104.29 et seq.), or any other
law to the contrary, in the case of a parcel of real property that is the
subject of a foreclosure action filed in Superior Court pursuant to the
provisions of either law, upon the approval of the action to foreclose the
right of redemption by the court, the court may not award a property ownership to
the tax lien purchaser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Instead, the court would be
required to order:  (1) a judicial sale of the property to be conducted by the
sheriff of the county in which the property is located, pursuant to any
direction or guidance promulgated by the Administrative Office of the Courts or
the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community
Affairs; (2)that the sum of all property taxes paid by the tax lien purchaser,
and interest due thereon, together with all costs related to the filing and
adjudication of the action to foreclose the right of redemption that were paid
by the tax lien purchaser, would be the first priority lien on the property,
paramount to any other lien, including any outstanding municipal lien; and (3)
that all costs of the judicial sale incurred by the sheriffs office would be
reimbursed from the proceeds of the sale.  The bill also provides that the amount
received at the judicial sale would be conclusively deemed to be the fair
market value of the property, and in the event that there are no bidders at the
judicial sale and the purchaser obtains fee title from the sheriff, the
property would be deemed to have no equity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With regard to the
disbursement of funds from a judicial sale of a foreclosed property, the bill
would require the sheriff to make the following reimbursements from these
moneys in the following order not later than 14 days following receipt by the
sheriff of the moneys paid by the winning bidder:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  to the purchaser, the sum
of all property taxes paid, and interest due thereon, together with all costs
related to the filing and adjudication of the action to foreclose the right of
redemption, notwithstanding any other provision of law. These costs may include,
but shall not be limited to, the costs associated with prejudgment noticing,
any service and filing fees, and all reasonable attorneys fees;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  to the municipality in
which the real property is located, the amount of any other municipal liens on
the property together with interest due and owing thereon;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)  to the sheriffs office,
the amounts needed to reimburse the costs of the judicial sale, and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  to the defendant, all
remaining moneys from the judicial sale, except that if the sheriff is unable
to locate and forward any remaining moneys to the defendant, those funds would
escheat to the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also prohibit
the payment by a bidder at a tax lien sale of a premium payment to the
municipality in order to obtain a tax sale certificate, once the interest rate
has been bid down to zero.  Instead, the bill would require a tax collector to
accept interest rate bids in even increments and in fractional interest rates of
0.25percent only.  If multiple bidders offer the same lowest rate of interest,
the collector would then be required to use a random-number generator to select
the successful bidder.  If a tax sale certificate is not purchased, the
certificate would be struck off to the municipality at the maximum rate of
interest allowed by law.  The bill would entitle the collector to a fee of five
percent of the amount of the delinquent taxes and interest when a tax sale
certificate is sold, except that the fee would be included in the face value of
the certificate, and the collector would not be entitled to the fee until that
certificate is redeemed or purchased. </p>
