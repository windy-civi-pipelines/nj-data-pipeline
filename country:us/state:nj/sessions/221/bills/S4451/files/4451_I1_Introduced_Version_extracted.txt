STATEMENT This bill modifies certain requirements for the preparation and adoption of a municipal master plan pursuant to section 19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28). Specifically, the bill requires a municipal master plan to include a housing plan element, and specifies that the housing plan element is to evaluate the need for, and establish a plan for, the provision of housing in the municipality, which is to include affordable housing.  The bill amends section 19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28) to require the housing plan element to include certain factors, currently provided in section 10 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-310), which the bill removes from section 10 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-310), and retains and reallocates to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28), in order to clarify a municipalitys obligations with respect to a housing plan element. The bill requires a municipalitys land use plan element to: (1) describe the land use plan elements relationship to, and how it is designed to effectuate, the housing plan element; and (2) show adopted redevelopment plans for areas designated in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation pursuant to the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law", P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.), and the status of redevelopment projects in those areas.
