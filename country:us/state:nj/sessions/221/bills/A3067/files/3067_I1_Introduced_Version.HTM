(cf: P.L.2015, c.215, s.6) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill revises the provisions of the Epinephrine Access and Emergency Treatment Act to allow any person who is in possession of an epinephrine auto-injector device pursuant to a valid prescription that was issued to the person, or to a minor child of the person, to administer the auto-injector device to any individual who appears to be suffering from anaphylaxis or any other serious condition that is treatable with epinephrine.  The person would not be subject to civil liability for administering the device in good faith and without fee. Currently, the Epinephrine Access and Emergency Treatment Act permits any person to obtain, administer, maintain, and dispose of epinephrine auto-injector devices upon completing an educational program approved by the Commissioner of Health.  However, current law does not explicitly allow individuals in possession of a device pursuant to a prescription issued to that person or a minor child of the person to administer the device to another individual in an emergency.  It is the sponsors belief that extending the scope of the Epinephrine Access and Emergency Treatment Act in this way will help promote access to this life-saving medication and encourage individuals in possession of the devices to administer them in emergency situations.
