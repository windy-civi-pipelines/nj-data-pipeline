The chief administrator is not required to design, produce, issue, or publicize the availability of the license plates, until: (1) the WITH Grace Initiative or the individual or entity designated by the WITH Grace Initiative has provided the commission with the money necessary to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission in establishing the license plate program; and (2) the WITH Grace Initiative liaison has provided the commission with a minimum of 500 completed applications for the license plates. The provisions of the bill will remain inoperative until the first day of the 13th month following the date on which the conditions established in the bill are met.  The bill expires on the last day of the 15th month if sufficient applications and fees to offset the initial costs are not received by that date. The WITH Grace Initiative, founded by pediatric cancer survivor Grace Eline and her parents, was created to make an impact by supporting pediatric cancer research initiatives and families when they need it most.  The WITH Grace Initiative collects supplies and gifts to give to less fortunate cancer families so they can focus on the cancer fight, gathers funds to support pediatric cancer research initiatives and cancer family support organizations, and actively participates in advocacy for pediatric cancer funding so no one else has to feel the pain of pediatric cancers.
