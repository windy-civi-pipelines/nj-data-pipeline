To facilitate the notification requirement, the bill directs the officer to accept and retain a submission from a property owner of the owners preferred mailing address or e-mail address, or both.  A "county recording officer" is also known as the "register of deeds and mortgages" in some counties, and the "county clerk" in the others.  A "quitclaim deed" is a form of a deed through which a grantor makes no promises concerning the extent of the present ownership of the property at issue, and no future promises concerning the property at issue, but conveys whatever estate or interest the grantor purports to have in the real property at issue. The bill allows the officer to collect a fee from property owners submitting notification requests to offset the cost of the notification requirement. The bill takes effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment in order to allow recording offices to adjust fees.
