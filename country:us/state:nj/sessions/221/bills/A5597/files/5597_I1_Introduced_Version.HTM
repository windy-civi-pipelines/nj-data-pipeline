A5597 ASSEMBLY, No. 5597 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 5, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  MARGIE DONLON, M.D. District 11 (Monmouth) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Haider SYNOPSIS Requires hospitals to adopt and develop environmental sustainability plan. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning hospitals and sustainability and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  There is a need to address sustainability in our States health care infrastructure as climate change is a significant driver of health and the social determinants of health. b.  Health Care Without Harm, an international organization working to make health care ecologically sustainable, has identified that the United States is the worlds highest emitter of healthcare greenhouse gases, accounting for 27 percent of the global healthcare footprint. c.  Sustainability initiatives can add value, reduce negative health and environmental impacts, and save critical healthcare dollars. d.  Health care institutions have launched environmental initiatives from emergency conservation to green lab programs.  For example, the Kaiser Permanente health system is the first in the country to reach carbon neutrality by taking sequential steps on the road to sustainability. They improved energy use efficiency by 8 percent since 2013, saving $19.6 million annually, and decreased water use intensity by 15.3 percent, saving $2.8 million annually. e.  Therefore, New Jerseys health care facilities must not be left behind and must begin a change to sustainability and healthcare resiliency for the benefit of our patients and our health systems. 2.  a.  As used in this section, hospital means an acute care general hospital licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). b.  Every four years, each hospital shall adopt, develop, and submit to the Department of Health an environmental sustainability plan, which plan shall set goals to transition the hospital to high performance and sustainable operations, procurement, and buildings, provide for the efficient use of natural resources, and consider the impact of the hospital on the local and regional environment.  A hospital newly licensed by the Department of Health shall be required to submit an environmental sustainability plan within six months of the date of licensure.  The environmental sustainability plan required pursuant to this subsection may include, but not be limited to, the following areas of focus: (1)   development of Green Teams and a Sustainability Officer within the executive suite of the hospital to ensure successful integration of sustainability into decision-making and day-to day-operations; (2)   identifying the financial implications, including potential savings, of implementing the environmental sustainability plan and potential funding sources for any expenditure increases; (3)   development of a sustainable purchasing strategy that prioritizes community and environmental health and safety through the acquisition of sustainable supplies, electronics, and other materials, and the prioritization of contracts with vendors focused on environmental sustainability; (4)   evaluation of hospital procurement with consideration of end-of-life disposition in order to reduce the volume and toxicity of materials and wastes; (5)   water use reduction and conservation; (6)   revising the design of operating rooms, from lighting, anesthesia, and reusables, to create less waste; (7)   identifying methods to utilize electricity produced from renewable energy sources, like wind and solar; (8)   provision of educational materials and programs for employees and the community to model and change the culture of sustainability at the hospital; (9)   identifying opportunities to purchase food through local and regional sources and purchase products with third-party certifications for quality and sustainability practices; (10)  promotion of less toxic chemical usage from substances used to deliver health care, cleaning supplies, and effective management of disposal; (11)  implementation of a policy or commitment to design and construct all new buildings and major renovations to LEED, or another green building design standard; (12)  identifying methods to lower the level of carbon emissions and reduce the carbon footprint of the hospital, including a plan to transition to electric or hybrid vehicles and other alternatives, such as planting trees and purchasing carbon credits to offset emissions; and (13)  fostering health system resilience and recognizing interdependencies and linkages of supply and demand and their contextual factors. b.  Each hospital shall issue an annual progress report on the implementation of the environmental sustainability plan required pursuant to subsection a. of this section to the Commissioner of Health on January 15 of each year, which plan shall be published on the Departments Internet website. c.  The Commissioner of Health may establish a Sustainability in Health Care Facilities Advisory Committee within the Department of Health to support the department in the review of environmental sustainability plans submitted pursuant to subsection a. of this section. 3.  The Commissioner of Health may adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as necessary to implement the provisions of this act. 4.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires each hospital to adopt, develop, and submit to the Department of Health an environmental sustainability plan every four years.  The environmental sustainability plan will set goals for the hospital to transition to high performance and sustainable operations, procurement, and buildings, provide for the efficient use of natural resources, and consider the impact of the hospital on the local and regional environment. Any hospital newly licensed by the Department of Health will be required to submit an environmental sustainability plan within six months of the date of licensure. The environmental sustainability plan required pursuant to the bill may include, but not be limited to, the following areas of focus: (1)   development of Green Teams and a Sustainability Officer within the executive suite of the hospital to ensure successful integration of sustainability into decision-making and day-to day-operations; (2)   identifying the financial implications, including potential savings, of implementing the environmental sustainability plan and potential funding sources for any expenditure increases; (3)   development of a sustainable purchasing strategy that prioritizes community and environmental health and safety through the acquisition of sustainable supplies, electronics, and other materials, and the prioritization of contracts with vendors focused on environmental sustainability; (4)   evaluation of hospital procurement with consideration of end-of-life disposition in order to reduce the volume and toxicity of materials and wastes; (5)   water use reduction and conservation; (6)   revising the design of operating rooms, from lighting, anesthesia, and reusables, to create less waste; (7)   identifying methods to utilize electricity produced from renewable energy sources, like wind and solar; (8)   provision of educational materials and programs for employees and the community to model and change the culture of sustainability at the hospital; (9)   identifying opportunities to purchase food through local and regional sources and purchase products with third-party certifications for quality and sustainability practices; (10)  promotion of less toxic chemical usage from substances used to deliver health care, cleaning supplies, and effective management of disposal; (11)  implementation of a policy or commitment to design and construct all new buildings and major renovations to LEED, or another green building design standard; (12)  identifying methods to lower the level of carbon emissions and reduce the carbon footprint of the hospital, including a plan to transition to electric or hybrid vehicles and other alternatives, such as planting trees and purchasing carbon credits to offset emissions; and (13)  fostering health system resilience and recognizing interdependencies and linkages of supply and demand and their contextual factors.
