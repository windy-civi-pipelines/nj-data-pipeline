(b)   [The owner, lessor, unit owners' association, agent or other person who manages or controls the common areas of a multiple dwelling shall cause to be delivered to each dwelling unit, twice annually, a notice, in form and manner prescribed by the commissioner, advising occupants of the obligation of the said owner, lessor, unit owners' association, agent or other person to install child-protection window guards pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1995, c.120 (C.55:13A-7.13).  A lease provision notifying a tenant of the availability of window guards may satisfy one of the notice requirements of this subparagraph.]  If by March 1 an owner, lessor, agent, or other person who manages or controls a unit of dwelling space in a multiple dwelling who has fully complied with this section has been unable to ascertain the need or desire for window guards in a dwelling unit or units, then the person shall notify, in writing, the Bureau of Housing Inspection in the Department of Community Affairs for the purpose of requesting assistance in regard to further compliance.  The written notice shall provide the name and telephone number of the person, inform the bureau of the person's inability to ascertain the need or desire for window guards in the dwelling unit or units, and describe the efforts undertaken by the person to comply with this section. (3)   The owner, lessor, unit owners' association, agent or other person who manages or controls the common areas of a multiple dwelling shall cause to be conspicuously posted and prominently displayed in the common areas of that multiple dwelling a notice advising the occupants of the obligation of the owner, lessor, unit owners' association, agent or other person to install child-protection window guards pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1995, c.120 (C.55:13A-7.13) and advising tenants to check [their] window guards on a regular basis and to report any problems or concerns to the owner, lessor, unit owners' association, agent or other person who manages or controls the dwelling unit or the common areas of the multiple dwelling, as may be applicable. c.     Notwithstanding any municipal ordinance to the contrary, expenditures not exceeding $20 per window guard installed in a dwelling unit that are made pursuant to P.L.1995, c.120 (C.55:13A-7.12 et seq.) may be passed on to the tenant [who requested installation of the window guard]. The commissioner shall adjust the amount per window guard that may be passed on to a tenant pursuant to this subsection no more frequently than once every 36 months, as the commissioner deems appropriate, to reflect the cumulative increases or decreases in the components of the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the Northeast Region, and the adjusted amount shall apply to window guards installed at least 90 days after the effective date of the adjustment. (cf: P.L.2006, c.55, s.3) 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following the date of enactment, except the commissioner may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill would amend the law governing the requirements to install and maintain child-protection window guards.  This bill was, unfortunately, motivated by reports of a four-year-old boy who fell to his death through an apartment window that did not have window guards installed.  Although current law requires landlords to install window guards upon the request of a tenant of an apartment unit where a child 10 years of age or younger resides, greater protections for small children are necessary. The bill would replace the current opt-in system with a system requiring landlords to install window guards in apartments of tenants with children unless the tenant opts-out of the window guard requirement. New Jersey law currently provides that leases must contain a notice advising tenants that, upon written request by the tenant, the owner is required to provide, install, and maintain window guards in dwelling units with children 10 years of age or younger.  This bill would require landlords to install window guards in any apartment in which a child 10 years of age or younger resides, and in apartments where the tenant requests window guards, even if a child 10 years of age or younger does not reside in the apartment.  However, the bill allows tenants with children to waive the right to have their landlords install window guards in their apartments. The bill requires landlords to provide each tenant with a form at the time of signing a lease, and annually thereafter, informing the tenant of the landlords obligation to install and maintain window guards, and of the ability of the tenant to waive the right to have the landlord install window guards in the tenants apartment.  The bill requires the Department of Community Affairs to prepare forms for this purpose in English and Spanish, and to make the forms available on the departments Internet website.  Under the bill, if a tenant waives the right to have the landlord install window guards, the tenant can later change his or her mind by providing the landlord a written notice requesting window guards. Current law requires landlords to inspect window guards at least twice a year to ensure that each window guard remains sound and conforms with legal requirements.  The bill specifies that landlords must inspect window guards once between February 1 and May 1 and once between September 1 and December 1. Current law excepts first floor windows from window guard requirements.  The bill would require the installation of window guards in first floor apartment windows unless the window is a required means of egress from the apartment. The New Jersey window guard law does not currently apply to seasonal rental units.  The bill will end that exception.  Current law allows a landlord to charge a tenant no more than $20 for each window guard installed in a tenants apartment.  The bill retains the reimbursement provision, however, requires the commissioner to adjust the amount per window guard that may be passed on to a tenant no more frequently than once every 36 months to account for inflation.

The commissioner shall adjust the amount per window guard that may be passed on to a tenant pursuant to this subsection no more frequently than once every 36 months, as the commissioner deems appropriate, to reflect the cumulative increases or decreases in the components of the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the Northeast Region, and the adjusted amount shall apply to window guards installed at least 90 days after the effective date of the adjustment.

STATEMENT This bill would amend the law governing the requirements to install and maintain child-protection window guards.  This bill was, unfortunately, motivated by reports of a four-year-old boy who fell to his death through an apartment window that did not have window guards installed.  Although current law requires landlords to install window guards upon the request of a tenant of an apartment unit where a child 10 years of age or younger resides, greater protections for small children are necessary. The bill would replace the current opt-in system with a system requiring landlords to install window guards in apartments of tenants with children unless the tenant opts-out of the window guard requirement. New Jersey law currently provides that leases must contain a notice advising tenants that, upon written request by the tenant, the owner is required to provide, install, and maintain window guards in dwelling units with children 10 years of age or younger.  This bill would require landlords to install window guards in any apartment in which a child 10 years of age or younger resides, and in apartments where the tenant requests window guards, even if a child 10 years of age or younger does not reside in the apartment.  However, the bill allows tenants with children to waive the right to have their landlords install window guards in their apartments. The bill requires landlords to provide each tenant with a form at the time of signing a lease, and annually thereafter, informing the tenant of the landlords obligation to install and maintain window guards, and of the ability of the tenant to waive the right to have the landlord install window guards in the tenants apartment.  The bill requires the Department of Community Affairs to prepare forms for this purpose in English and Spanish, and to make the forms available on the departments Internet website.  Under the bill, if a tenant waives the right to have the landlord install window guards, the tenant can later change his or her mind by providing the landlord a written notice requesting window guards. Current law requires landlords to inspect window guards at least twice a year to ensure that each window guard remains sound and conforms with legal requirements.  The bill specifies that landlords must inspect window guards once between February 1 and May 1 and once between September 1 and December 1. Current law excepts first floor windows from window guard requirements.  The bill would require the installation of window guards in first floor apartment windows unless the window is a required means of egress from the apartment. The New Jersey window guard law does not currently apply to seasonal rental units.  The bill will end that exception.  Current law allows a landlord to charge a tenant no more than $20 for each window guard installed in a tenants apartment.  The bill retains the reimbursement provision, however, requires the commissioner to adjust the amount per window guard that may be passed on to a tenant no more frequently than once every 36 months to account for inflation.
