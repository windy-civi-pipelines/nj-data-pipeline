Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 26 of P.L.1999,
c.152 (C.13:8C-26) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     26.  a. Moneys appropriated
from the Garden State Green Acres Preservation Trust Fund to the Department of
Environmental Protection shall be used by the department to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Pay the cost of
acquisition and development of lands by the State for recreation and
conservation purposes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Provide grants and loans
to assist local government units to pay the cost of acquisition and development
of lands for recreation and conservation purposes; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Provide grants to assist
qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organizations to pay the cost of acquisition
and development of lands for recreation and conservation purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The expenditure and
allocation of constitutionally dedicated moneys for recreation and conservation
purposes shall reflect the geographic diversity of the State to the maximum
extent practicable and feasible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1) Notwithstanding the
provisions of section 5 of P.L.1985, c.310 (C.13:18A-34) or this act, or any
rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, to the contrary, the value of a
pinelands development credit, allocated to a parcel pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111
(C.13:18A-1 et seq.) and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted
pursuant thereto, shall be made utilizing a value to be determined by either
appraisal, regional averaging based upon appraisal data, or a formula supported
by appraisal data.  The appraisal and appraisal data shall consider as
appropriate:  land values in the pinelands regional growth areas; land values
in counties, municipalities, and other areas reasonably contiguous to, but
outside of, the pinelands area; and other relevant factors as may be necessary
to maintain the environmental, ecological, and agricultural qualities of the
pinelands area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   No pinelands development
credit allocated to a parcel of land pursuant to P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et
seq.) and the pinelands comprehensive management plan adopted pursuant thereto
that is acquired or obtained in connection with the acquisition of the parcel
for recreation and conservation purposes by the State, a local government unit,
or a qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization using constitutionally
dedicated moneys in whole or in part may be conveyed in any manner.  All such
pinelands development credits shall be retired permanently.</p>

P.L.2010, c.70)</p>

from the fund may be used to match grants, contributions, donations, or
reimbursements from federal aid programs or from other public or private
sources established for the same or similar purposes as the fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Moneys appropriated
from the fund shall not be used by local government units or qualifying tax
exempt nonprofit organizations to acquire lands that are already permanently
preserved for recreation and conservation purposes, as determined by the
department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Whenever lands are
donated to the State by a public utility, as defined pursuant to Title 48 of
the Revised Statutes, for recreation and conservation purposes, the
commissioner may make and keep the lands accessible to the public, unless the
commissioner determines that public accessibility would be detrimental to the
lands or any natural resources associated therewith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Whenever the State
acquires land for recreation and conservation purposes, the agency in the
Department of Environmental Protection responsible for administering the land
shall, within six months after the date of acquisition, inspect the land for
the presence of any buildings or structures thereon which are or may be
historic properties and, within 60 days after completion of the inspection,
provide to the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office in the department (1) a
written notice of its findings, and (2) for any buildings or structures which
are or may be historic properties discovered on the land, a request for
determination of potential eligibility for inclusion of the historic building
or structure in the New Jersey Register of Historic Places.  Whenever such a
building or structure is discovered, a copy of the written notice provided to
the New Jersey Historic Preservation Office shall also be sent to the New
Jersey Historic Trust and to the county historical commission or advisory
committee, the county historical society, the local historic preservation
commission or advisory committee, and the local historical society if any of
those entities exist in the county or municipality wherein the land is located.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would direct the
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in consultation with the State
Agriculture Development Committee (SADC), to adopt model wildlife management
plans for use by local public entities that seek to acquire or develop land for
recreational and conservation (open space) purposes, and it would further direct
the SADC, in consultation with the DEP, to adopt model wildlife management
plans for use by local public entities that are seeking funds to acquire and
preserve farmland.  The bill would further provide that, whenever the State or
a local government unit seeks to acquire or develop lands for recreational or
conservation purposes, or for farmland preservation purposes, using
constitutionally dedicated moneys or Green Acres bond act moneys in whole or in
part, it will be required to adopt and implement, at the subject property, one
of the model wildlife management plans that have been cooperatively developed
by the DEP and SADC under the bills provisions.  A local government unit would
also be required to be implement the plan selected thereby at other parcels of
land which have been acquired thereby, for recreational and conservation
purposes, using constitutionally dedicated moneys or Green Acres bond act
moneys in whole or in part.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would authorize a
local government unit, in lieu of adopting one of the new model wildlife
management plans developed under the bill, to submit to the DEP or SADC, as the
case may be, a wildlife management plan that has been prepared by the local
government unit prior to the bills effective date, and to adopt and implement
such pre-existing wildlife management plan, both at the subject property and at
other relevant parcels of land owned thereby, upon the DEPs or SADCs approval
thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would amend the
Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), in order to
clarify that wildlife management activities or tasks, which are undertaken on preserved
open space or farmland in accordance with a wildlife management plan adopted
pursuant to the bills provisions, are to be understood to constitute a type of
stewardship activity for which Corporation Business Tax (CBT) revenues, which
have been constitutionally dedicated for the stewardship of preserved open
space and farmland, may be appropriated, allocated, and expended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Existing law does not currently
require the owners or operators of publicly owned open space or preserved farmland
to adopt or implement wildlife management plans for or on such properties; nor
does it authorize the use of constitutionally dedicated CBT funds for wildlife
management planning undertaken for the benefit of such parcels.</p>
