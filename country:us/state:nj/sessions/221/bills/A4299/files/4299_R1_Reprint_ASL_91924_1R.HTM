Nonresidential Treatment Program; Presumption of Revocation; Brief

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Any person who is
ineligible for probation due to a conviction for a crime which is subject to a
presumption of incarceration or a mandatory minimum period of parole
ineligibility may be sentenced to a term of special probation in accordance
with this section, and may not apply for treatment for substance use disorder
pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prohibit a person who is eligible for probation in accordance with
N.J.S.2C:45-1 due to a conviction for an offense which is not subject to a
presumption of incarceration or a mandatory minimum period of parole
ineligibility from applying for treatment for substance use disorder as a
condition of probation pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1; provided, however, that a
person in need of treatment as defined in subsection f. of section 2 of
P.L.2012, c.23 (C.2C:35-14.2) shall be sentenced in accordance with that
section.  Notwithstanding the presumption of incarceration pursuant to the
provisions of subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:44-1, whenever a person with a
substance use disorder who is subject to sentencing under this section is
convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for an offense, other than one described
in subsection b. of this section, the court, upon notice to the prosecutor,
may, on motion of the person, or on the courts own motion, place the person on
special probation, which shall be for a term of five years, provided that the
court finds on the record that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the person has undergone
a professional diagnostic assessment to determine whether and to what extent
the person has a substance use disorder and would benefit from treatment; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the person has a
substance use disorder within the meaning of N.J.S.2C:35-2 and was with a
substance use disorder at the time of the commission of the present offense;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the present offense was
committed while the person was under the influence of a controlled dangerous
substance, controlled substance analog or alcohol or was committed to acquire
property or monies in order to support the persons substance use disorder; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   substance use  disorder
treatment and monitoring will serve to benefit the person by addressing the
person's substance use disorder and will thereby reduce the likelihood that the
person will thereafter commit another offense; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   the person did not
possess a firearm at the time of the present offense and did not possess a
firearm at the time of any pending criminal charge; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   the person has not been
previously convicted on two or more separate occasions of crimes of the first
or second degree, other than those listed in paragraph (7); or the person has
not been previously convicted on two or more separate occasions, where one of
the offenses is a crime of the third degree, other than crimes defined in
N.J.S.2C:35-10, and one of the offenses is a crime of the first or second
degree; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   the person has not been
previously convicted or adjudicated delinquent for, and does not have a pending
charge of murder, aggravated manslaughter, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated
assault, aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault, or a similar crime under
the laws of any other state or the United States; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   a suitable treatment
facility licensed and approved by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction
Services in the Department of Human Services is able and has agreed to provide
appropriate treatment services in accordance with the requirements of this
section; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   no danger to the
community will result from the person being placed on special probation
pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In determining whether to
sentence the person pursuant to this section, the court shall consider all
relevant circumstances, and shall take judicial notice of any evidence,
testimony or information adduced at the trial, plea hearing or other court
proceedings, and shall also consider the presentence report and the results of
the professional diagnostic assessment to determine whether and to what extent
the person has a substance use disorder and would benefit from treatment.  The
court shall give priority to a person who has moved to be sentenced to special
probation over a person who is being considered for a sentence to special
probation on the courts own motion or in accordance with the provisions of
section 2 of P.L.2012, c.23 (C.2C:35-14.2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As a condition of special
probation, the court shall order the person to enter a residential treatment
program at a facility licensed and approved by the Division of Mental Health
and Addiction Services in the Department of Human Services or a program of
nonresidential treatment by a licensed and approved treatment provider, which
program may include the use of medication-assisted treatment as defined in
paragraph (7) of subsection f. of this section, to comply with program rules
and the requirements of the course of treatment, to cooperate fully with the
treatment provider, and to comply with such other reasonable terms and
conditions as may be required by the court or by law, pursuant to
N.J.S.2C:45-1, and which shall include periodic urine testing for drug or
alcohol usage throughout the period of special probation.  In determining
whether to order the person to participate in a nonresidential rather than a
residential treatment program, the court shall follow the procedure set forth
in subsection j. of this section.  Subject to the requirements of subsection d.
of this section, the conditions of special probation may include different
methods and levels of community-based or residential supervision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A person shall not be
eligible for special probation pursuant to this section if the person is
convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a crime of the first
degree;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   a crime of the first or
second degree enumerated in subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117

defined in section 1 of P.L.1987, c.101 (C.2C:35-7), for which a mandatory
minimum period of incarceration is prescribed under chapter 35 of this Title or
any other law; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   an offense that involved
the distribution or the conspiracy or attempt to distribute a controlled

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.2012, c.23)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Except as otherwise
provided in subsection j. of this section, a person convicted of or adjudicated
delinquent for a crime of the second degree or of a violation of section 1 of
P.L.1987, c.101 (C.2C:35-7), or who previously has been convicted of or
adjudicated delinquent for an offense under subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-5 or a
similar offense under any other law of this State, any other state or the
United States, who is placed on special probation under this section shall be
committed to the custody of a residential substance use  disorder treatment
facility licensed and approved by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction
Services in the Department of Human Services.  Subject to the authority of the
court to temporarily suspend imposition of all or any portion of the term of
commitment to a residential treatment facility pursuant to subsection j. of
this section, the person shall be committed to the residential treatment
facility immediately, unless the facility cannot accommodate the person, in
which case the person shall be incarcerated to await commitment to the residential
treatment facility.  The term of such commitment shall be for a minimum of six
months, or until the court, upon recommendation of the treatment provider,
determines that the person has successfully completed the residential treatment
program, whichever is later, except that no person shall remain in the custody
of a residential treatment facility pursuant to this section for a period in
excess of five years.  Upon successful completion of the required residential
treatment program, the person shall complete the period of special probation,
as authorized by subsection a. of this section, with credit for time served for
any imprisonment served as a condition of probation and credit for each day
during which the person satisfactorily complied with the terms and conditions
of special probation while committed pursuant to this section to a residential
treatment facility.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection l. of this
section, the person shall not be eligible for early discharge of special
probation pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-2, or any other provision of the law.  The
court, in determining the number of credits for time spent in residential
treatment, shall consider the recommendations of the treatment provider.  A
person placed into a residential treatment facility pursuant to this section
shall be deemed to be subject to official detention for the purposes of
N.J.S.2C:29-5 (escape).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The probation
department or other appropriate agency designated by the court to monitor or
supervise the persons special probation shall report periodically to the court
as to the persons progress in treatment and compliance with court-imposed
terms and conditions.  The treatment provider shall promptly report to the
probation department or other appropriate agency all significant failures by
the person to comply with any court-imposed term or condition of special
probation or any requirements of the course of treatment, including but not
limited to a positive drug or alcohol test, which shall only constitute a
violation for a person using medication-assisted treatment as defined in
paragraph (7) of subsection f. of this section if the positive test is
unrelated to the persons medication-assisted treatment, or the unexcused
failure to attend any session or activity, and shall immediately report any act
that would constitute an escape.  The probation department or other appropriate
agency shall immediately notify the court and the prosecutor in the event that
the person refuses to submit to a periodic drug or alcohol test or for any
reason terminates the person's participation in the course of treatment, or
commits any act that would constitute an escape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  (1) Upon a first violation
of any term or condition of the special probation authorized by this section or
of any requirements of the course of treatment, the court in its discretion may
permanently revoke the persons special probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Upon a second or
subsequent violation of any term or condition of the special probation
authorized by this section or of any requirements of the course of treatment,
the court shall, subject only to the provisions of subsection g. of this
section, permanently revoke the persons special probation unless the court
finds on the record that there is a substantial likelihood that the person will
successfully complete the treatment program if permitted to continue on special
probation, and the court is clearly convinced, considering the nature and
seriousness of the violations, that no danger to the community will result from
permitting the person to continue on special probation pursuant to this
section.  The courts determination to permit the person to continue on special
probation following a second or subsequent violation pursuant to this paragraph
may be appealed by the prosecution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   In making its
determination whether to revoke special probation, and whether to overcome the
presumption of revocation established in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the
court shall consider the nature and seriousness of the present infraction and
any past infractions in relation to the persons overall progress in the course
of treatment, and shall also consider the recommendations of the treatment
provider.  The court shall give added weight to the treatment providers
recommendation that the persons special probation be permanently revoked, or
to the treatment providers opinion that the person is not amenable to
treatment or is not likely to complete the treatment program successfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   If the court permanently
revokes the persons special probation pursuant to this subsection, the court
shall impose any sentence that might have been imposed, or that would have been
required to be imposed, originally for the offense for which the person was
convicted or adjudicated delinquent.  The court shall conduct a de novo review
of any aggravating and mitigating factors present at the time of both original
sentencing and resentencing.  If the court determines or is required pursuant
to any other provision of this chapter or any other law to impose a term of imprisonment,
the person shall receive credit for any time served in custody pursuant to
N.J.S.2C:45-1 or while awaiting placement in a treatment facility pursuant to
this section, and for each day during which the person satisfactorily complied
with the terms and conditions of special probation while committed pursuant to
this section to a residential treatment facility.  The court, in determining
the number of credits for time spent in a residential treatment facility, shall
consider the recommendations of the treatment provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Following a violation,
if the court permits the person to continue on special probation pursuant to
this section, the court shall order the person to comply with such additional
terms and conditions, including but not limited to more frequent drug or
alcohol testing, as are necessary to deter and promptly detect any further
violation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Notwithstanding any
other provision of this subsection, if the person at any time refuses to
undergo urine testing for drug or alcohol usage as provided in subsection a. of
this section, the court shall, subject only to the provisions of subsection g.
of this section, permanently revoke the persons special probation. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the person at any time
while committed to the custody of a residential treatment facility pursuant to
this section commits an act that would constitute an escape, the court shall
forthwith permanently revoke the persons special probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   An action for a
violation under this section may be brought by a probation officer or
prosecutor or on the courts own motion.  Failure to complete successfully the
required treatment program shall constitute a violation of the person's special
probation.  In the case of the temporary or continued management of a persons
substance use disorder by means of medication-assisted treatment as defined
herein, whenever supported by a report from the treatment provider of existing
satisfactory progress and reasonably predictable long-term success with or
without further medication-assisted treatment, the persons use of the
medication-assisted treatment, even if continuing, shall not be the basis to
constitute a failure to complete successfully the treatment program.  A person
who fails to comply with the terms of the persons special probation pursuant
to this section and is thereafter sentenced to imprisonment in accordance with
this subsection shall thereafter be ineligible for entry into the Intensive
Supervision Program, provided however that this provision shall not affect the
persons eligibility for entry into the Intensive Supervision Program for a
subsequent conviction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this section, the
term medication-assisted treatment means the use of any medications approved
by the federal Food and Drug Administration to treat substance use disorders,
including extended-release naltrexone, methadone, and buprenorphine, in
combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide a
whole-patient approach to the treatment of substance use disorders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    When a person on special
probation is subject to a presumption of revocation on a second or subsequent
violation pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection f. of this section, or when
the person refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing pursuant to paragraph (6)
of subsection f. of this section, the court may, in lieu of permanently
revoking the persons special probation, impose a term of incarceration for a
period of not less than 30 days nor more than six months, after which the persons
term of special probation pursuant to this section may be reinstated.  In
determining whether to order a period of incarceration in lieu of permanent
revocation pursuant to this subsection, the court shall consider the
recommendations of the treatment provider with respect to the likelihood that
such confinement would serve to motivate the person to make satisfactory
progress in treatment once special probation is reinstated.  This disposition
may occur only once with respect to any person unless the court is clearly
convinced that there are compelling and extraordinary reasons to justify
reimposing this disposition with respect to the person.  Any such determination
by the court to reimpose this disposition may be appealed by the prosecution. 
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the
court at any time during the period of special probation to order a person on
special probation who is not subject to a presumption of revocation pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subsection f. of this section to be incarcerated over the
course of a weekend, or for any other reasonable period of time, when the court
in its discretion determines that such incarceration would help to motivate the
person to make satisfactory progress in treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The court, as a
condition of its order, and after considering the persons financial resources,
shall require the person to pay that portion of the costs associated with the
persons participation in any residential or nonresidential treatment program
imposed pursuant to this section which, in the opinion of the court, is
consistent with the persons ability to pay, taking into account the courts
authority to order payment or reimbursement to be made over time and in
installments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The court shall impose,
as a condition of the special probation, any fine, penalty, fee or restitution
applicable to the offense for which the person was convicted or adjudicated
delinquent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     Where the court finds
that a person has satisfied all of the eligibility criteria for special
probation and would otherwise be required to be committed to the custody of a
residential substance use disorders treatment facility pursuant to the
provisions of subsection d. of this section, the court may temporarily suspend
imposition of all or any portion of the term of commitment to a residential
treatment facility and may instead order the person to enter a nonresidential
treatment program, provided that the court finds on the record that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the person conducting
the diagnostic assessment required pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a.
of this section has recommended in writing that the proposed course of
nonresidential treatment services is clinically appropriate and adequate to
address the persons treatment needs; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   no danger to the

the courts decision to suspend the commitment of the person to a residential
treatment facility pursuant to this subsection, the sentence of special
probation imposed pursuant to this section shall not become final for 10 days

that there is a substantial likelihood that the person will successfully
complete the nonresidential treatment program and period of special probation,
the court, on notice to the prosecutor, may permanently suspend the commitment
of the person to the custody of a residential treatment program, in which event
the special monitoring provisions set forth in subsection k. of this section

order the person to undergo urine testing for drug or alcohol use not less than
once per week unless otherwise ordered by the court.  The court-ordered testing
shall be conducted by the probation department or the treatment provider.  The
results of all tests shall be reported promptly to the court and to the
prosecutor.  If the person is involved with a program that is providing the
person medication-assisted treatment as defined in paragraph (7) of subsection
f. of this section, only a positive urine test for drug or alcohol use
unrelated to the medication-assisted treatment shall constitute a violation of
the terms and conditions of special probation.  In addition, the court shall
impose appropriate curfews or other restrictions on the persons movements, and

any act that would constitute absconding from parole.  If the person at any
time while entered in a nonresidential treatment program pursuant to subsection
j. of this section knowingly defrauds the administration of a drug or alcohol
test, goes into hiding, or leaves the State with a purpose of avoiding
supervision, the court shall permanently revoke the persons special probation.</p>

discharge from a term of special probation provided that the person: (1) has
satisfactorily completed the treatment program ordered by the court; (2) has
served at least two years of special probation; (3) within the preceding 12
months, did not commit a substantial violation of any term or condition of
special probation, including but not limited to a positive urine test, which
shall only constitute a violation for a person using medication-assisted
treatment as defined in paragraph (7) of subsection f. of this section if the
positive test is unrelated to the persons medication-assisted treatment; and

N.J.S.2C:52-2 through section 1 of P.L.1980, c.163 (C.2C:52-4.1) shall not
apply.  A person who was convicted of any offense barred from expungement
pursuant to subsection b. or c. of N.J.S.2C:52-2, or who has been convicted of
any crime or offense since the date of discharge from special probation shall

under this paragraph.  The Superior Court shall consider the persons verified
petition and may order the expungement of all records and information relating

existed at the time of discharge from special probation as appropriate.  The
court shall grant the relief requested unless it finds that the need for the

of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:24-4, involving endangering the welfare of a child,
which is barred from expungement pursuant to subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:52-2 and

been successfully discharged from a term of special probation as provided in
this section, regardless of whether the person was sentenced to special
probation under this section, section 2 of P.L.2012, c.23 (C.2C:35-14.2), or

of the criminal act, or if that person has been convicted of any crime or
offense since the date of discharge from special probation.  In addition, no

any disqualifying convictions, any conviction for endangering the welfare of a
child reviewed by the prosecutor and found to be violent, or any other factors
related to public safety that should be considered by the court when deciding
