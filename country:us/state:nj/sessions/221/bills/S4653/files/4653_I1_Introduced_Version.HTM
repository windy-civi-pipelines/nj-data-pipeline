finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Vacant and abandoned properties
significantly burden a municipality and its taxpayers by causing municipal
taxpayers to pay the share of tax revenue that it is not collected by these
properties, while the proliferation of foreclosures burdens both the States
courts and local economies; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    This loss in tax revenue
causes an increase in the municipalitys statutorily required reserve for
uncollected taxes, thereby causing taxpayers to pay higher property taxes,
which gets passed on to residential tenants through increased costs in rental
housing; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     c.     Over
300,000 housing units in New Jersey are currently vacant, many of which are
tax-delinquent, abandoned, or underutilized, contributing to and compounding
the States severe shortage of more than 200,000 affordable housing units for
low- and moderate-income residents;</span></p>

the acquisition, rehabilitation, and conversion of vacant, abandoned, and
foreclosed properties into affordable housing is critical to support equitable
economic development and resolve the States housing emergency;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.<span style='background:
white'>     The New Jersey Supreme Court, in Township of Montville v. Block 69,
Lot 10, 74 N.J. 1 (1977), held that a property owner is entitled to either
personal service or mailed notice of foreclosure as a requirement of constitutional
due process, that notice by publication alone is insufficient, and that,
without prior notice to an owner at the owners last known address,
jurisdiction is lacking to enter a judgment to foreclose the right of
redemption against the owner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    It is necessary,
however, to modify the statutory process to foreclose the right of redemption
for foreclosed properties in a manner that remains consistent with the United
States Supreme Courts decision in Tyler v. Hennepin County, 598 U.S. 631
(2023), and yet enables foreclosed properties to be expeditiously repurposed in
a manner that reduces the municipal tax burden, reduces pass through rental
costs for low- and moderate-income renters, and enhances a municipalitys
ability to provide affordable housing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Although the issue in
Tyler v. Hennepin County, 598 U.S. 631 (2023) was not service of process, nor
was service contested, after the decision, the New Jersey Supreme Court issued
temporary court rules that required personal service of all in rem complaints
and personal service of the motion for final judgment, as part of an effort to
facilitate the ability of a property owner to protect any surplus equity in the
property;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Personal service
substantially slows down the ability of a municipality or other tax lien holder
to foreclose the right of redemption and repurpose the property by several
months, causing municipalities, and ultimately taxpayers and renters, to be
subject to significant expenses for litigation and the lack of tax revenue for numerous
months on these foreclosed properties, compared to service by certified mail;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     On July 10, 2024, the
Governor signed P.L.2024, c.39 (C.54:5-98.1 et al.) into law, which amended the
&quot;tax sale law,&quot; R.S.54:5-1 et seq., and the In Rem Tax Foreclosure
Act (1948), P.L.1948, c.96 (C.54:5-104.29 et seq.), to comply with Tyler v.
Hennepin County, 598 U.S. 631 (2023), and provide to an owner the right to
request a sheriffs sale to protect any surplus equity, unless the property
meets the definition of an abandoned property;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    Despite the enactment of
P.L.2024, c.39 (C.54:5-98.1 et al.), the New Jersey Supreme Court has not
vacated the temporary court rules that still require personal service; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     While, as recognized by
the New Jersey Supreme Court in Winberry v. Salsbury, 5 N.J. 240, cert. denied,
340 U.S. 877 (1950), the Supreme Court has exclusive power to enact rules of
practice and procedure, which power is subject to and exclusive of substantive
law within the domain of the Legislature, the substantive-procedural dichotomy has
been analyzed in subsequent cases with mixed results for legislative enactments
having both substantive and procedural characteristics;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.   The Supreme Court
observed, in State v. Otis Elevator Co., 12 N.J. 1 (1953), that the court, as
part of its constitutional obligations, is tasked with providing rules that are
efficient, equitable, and procedurally practicable;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.    In State v.
Vega-Larregui, 246 N.J. 94 (2021), the Supreme Court reemphasized that the
Supreme Court may permit or accommodate the lawful and reasonable exercise of
the powers of the other branches of government, even as that might impinge upon
the Courts constitutional concerns in the judicial area, as the purpose of the
separation of powers is not to create three &quot;watertight&quot; governmental
compartments, stifling cooperative action among the three branches of government;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     o.    Supreme Court
jurisprudence since Winberry v. Salsbury, 5 N.J. 240 (1950), has demonstrated
that the procedural characteristics of a legislative enactment do not
necessarily determine the enactments fate, and that judicial power need not in
every context or application be preclusive; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     p.    Analysis of legislative
enactments pivots on a two-pronged analysis of first, whether the judiciary has
fully exercised judicial power with respect to the matter at issue, and whether
the statute serves a legitimate legislative goal and does not interfere with
judicial prerogatives or only indirectly touches upon the judicial domain;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     q.    The Supreme Court has
cautioned that courts are to act with restraint when legislation, touching on the
judicial sphere, advances a &quot;significant governmental purpose&quot; and
does not interfere with the Supreme Courts administration of the judicial
system;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     r.     Accordingly, the
Supreme Court has upheld legislative enactments concerning the Tort Claims Act,
Busik v. Levine, 63 N.J. 351 (1973); pre-trial intervention, State v.
Leonardis, 73 N.J. 360 (1977); the Conflict of Interest Law, Knight v. City of
Margate, 86 N.J. 374 (1981); preclusion of judicial suspension of sentences and
enactment of mandatory sentencing laws, State v. Des Marets, 92 N.J. 62 (1983);
statutory post-employment restrictions for State employees, In re Advisory
Comm. On Pro. Ethics Op. 705, 192 N.J. 46 (2007); and plea bargaining, In re
New Jersey Rules of Ct., Part VII, Guideline 4, ____ N.J. ____ (2024);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     s.     Despite Passaic Cty.
Prob. Officers Assn. v. County of Passaic, 73 N.J. 247 (1977), in which the
Supreme Court observed that legislative enactments are only upheld if the
enactments have not in any way interfered with the proper administration of the
court system, as recently as 2024, in In re New Jersey Rules of Ct., Part VII,
Guideline 4, ____ N.J. ____ (2024), the Supreme Court upheld P.L.2023, c.191
(C.39:4-50.21a et al.), which <i>directly</i> conflicted with judicial authority
that, according to the Supreme Court, was well within the Courts rule-making
authority and for which the &quot;judiciary [had] fully exercised its power
with respect to the matter at issue;&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     t.     Accordingly, even if
the New Jersey Supreme Court determines that a legislative enactment touches on
an area within the judicial sphere, the Supreme Court has upheld numerous statutes
despite even a direct conflict with matters for which the judiciary had already
exercised its power;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     u.    In conducting an
evaluation, as the Supreme Court observed in State v. Loftin, 157 N.J. 253
(1999), the Supreme Court remains mindful of the obligation to uphold a
legislative enactment absent constitutional repugnance;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     v.    Amidst the affordable
housing emergency facing the State, it is necessary for the Legislature to enhance
the ability of a tax lien holder to foreclose the right of redemption by, in
addition to service by publication, requiring service by certified mail instead
of personal service;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     w.   Requiring service by
certified mail instead of personal service enables tax lien holders to repurpose
over 300,000 abandoned, vacant, or foreclosed properties that may be used for
the production of affordable housing; provide a solution to the States severe affordable
housing shortage; and reduce the municipal, taxpayer, and renter burden for
unpaid property taxes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     x.    Such legislation represents
a significant government interest, which squarely comports with Tyler v.
Hennepin County, 598 U.S. 631 (2023);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     y.    That significant government
interest is best served, in the spirit of comity and the public interest, by
collaboration among the coordinate branches of government; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     z.     Therefore, it is
necessary, in the public interest, and proper for the Legislature to establish
a ta<span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>rgeted State investment and legal
framework to accelerate the acquisition, rehabilitation, and conversion of
vacant, abandoned, and foreclosed properties into affordable housing, which can
improve neighborhood stability, expand homeownership, and support equitable
economic development, while reducing costs for taxpayers and residential
tenants.</span></p>

support the acquisition, rehabilitation, and conversion of vacant, abandoned,

equitable economic development and resolve the States housing emergency;</span></p>

white'>     The New Jersey Supreme Court, in Township of Montville v. Block 69,
Lot 10, 74 N.J. 1 (1977), held that a property owner is entitled to either
personal service or mailed notice of foreclosure as a requirement of
constitutional due process, that notice by publication alone is insufficient,
and that, without prior notice to an owner at the owners last known address,
jurisdiction is lacking to enter a judgment to foreclose the right of
redemption against the owner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    It is necessary,
however, to modify the statutory process to foreclose the right of redemption
for foreclosed properties in a manner that remains consistent with the United
States Supreme Courts decision in Tyler v. Hennepin County, 598 U.S. 631
(2023), and yet enables foreclosed properties to be expeditiously repurposed in
a manner that reduces the municipal tax burden, reduces pass through rental
costs for low- and moderate-income renters, and enhances a municipalitys
ability to provide affordable housing;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Although the issue in
Tyler v. Hennepin County, 598 U.S. 631 (2023) was not service of process, nor
was service contested, after the decision, the New Jersey Supreme Court issued
temporary court rules that required personal service of all in rem complaints
and personal service of the motion for final judgment, as part of an effort to
facilitate the ability of a property owner to protect any surplus equity in the
property;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Personal service
substantially slows down the ability of a municipality or other tax lien holder
to foreclose the right of redemption and repurpose the property by several
months, causing municipalities, and ultimately taxpayers and renters, to be
subject to significant expenses for litigation and the lack of tax revenue for
numerous months on these foreclosed properties, compared to service by
certified mail;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     On July 10, 2024, the
Governor signed P.L.2024, c.39 (C.54:5-98.1 et al.) into law, which amended the
&quot;tax sale law,&quot; R.S.54:5-1 et seq., and the In Rem Tax Foreclosure
Act (1948), P.L.1948, c.96 (C.54:5-104.29 et seq.), to comply with Tyler v.
Hennepin County, 598 U.S. 631 (2023), and provide to an owner the right to
request a sheriffs sale to protect any surplus equity, unless the property meets
the definition of an abandoned property;</p>

P.L.2024, c.39 (C.54:5-98.1 et al.), the New Jersey Supreme Court has not
vacated the temporary court rules that still require personal service; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     While, as recognized by
the New Jersey Supreme Court in Winberry v. Salsbury, 5 N.J. 240, cert. denied,
340 U.S. 877 (1950), the Supreme Court has exclusive power to enact rules of
practice and procedure, which power is subject to and exclusive of substantive
law within the domain of the Legislature, the substantive-procedural dichotomy
has been analyzed in subsequent cases with mixed results for legislative
enactments having both substantive and procedural characteristics;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.   The Supreme Court
observed, in State v. Otis Elevator Co., 12 N.J. 1 (1953), that the court, as
part of its constitutional obligations, is tasked with providing rules that are
efficient, equitable, and procedurally practicable;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.    In State v.
Vega-Larregui, 246 N.J. 94 (2021), the Supreme Court reemphasized that the
Supreme Court may permit or accommodate the lawful and reasonable exercise of
the powers of the other branches of government, even as that might impinge upon
the Courts constitutional concerns in the judicial area, as the purpose of the
separation of powers is not to create three &quot;watertight&quot; governmental
compartments, stifling cooperative action among the three branches of
government;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     o.    Supreme Court
jurisprudence since Winberry v. Salsbury, 5 N.J. 240 (1950), has demonstrated
that the procedural characteristics of a legislative enactment do not
necessarily determine the enactments fate, and that judicial power need not in
every context or application be preclusive; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     p.    Analysis of legislative
enactments pivots on a two-pronged analysis of first, whether the judiciary has
fully exercised judicial power with respect to the matter at issue, and whether
the statute serves a legitimate legislative goal and does not interfere with
judicial prerogatives or only indirectly touches upon the judicial domain;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     q.    The Supreme Court has
cautioned that courts are to act with restraint when legislation, touching on
the judicial sphere, advances a &quot;significant governmental purpose&quot;
and does not interfere with the Supreme Courts administration of the judicial
system;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     r.     Accordingly, the
Supreme Court has upheld legislative enactments concerning the Tort Claims Act,
Busik v. Levine, 63 N.J. 351 (1973); pre-trial intervention, State v.
Leonardis, 73 N.J. 360 (1977); the Conflict of Interest Law, Knight v. City of
Margate, 86 N.J. 374 (1981); preclusion of judicial suspension of sentences and
enactment of mandatory sentencing laws, State v. Des Marets, 92 N.J. 62 (1983);
statutory post-employment restrictions for State employees, In re Advisory
Comm. On Pro. Ethics Op. 705, 192 N.J. 46 (2007); and plea bargaining, In re
New Jersey Rules of Ct., Part VII, Guideline 4, ____ N.J. ____ (2024);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     s.     Despite Passaic Cty.
Prob. Officers Assn. v. County of Passaic, 73 N.J. 247 (1977), in which the
Supreme Court observed that legislative enactments are only upheld if the
enactments have not in any way interfered with the proper administration of the
court system, as recently as 2024, in In re New Jersey Rules of Ct., Part VII,
Guideline 4, ____ N.J. ____ (2024), the Supreme Court upheld P.L.2023, c.191
(C.39:4-50.21a et al.), which <i>directly</i> conflicted with judicial authority
that, according to the Supreme Court, was well within the Courts rule-making
authority and for which the &quot;judiciary [had] fully exercised its power
with respect to the matter at issue;&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     t.     Accordingly, even if
the New Jersey Supreme Court determines that a legislative enactment touches on
an area within the judicial sphere, the Supreme Court has upheld numerous
statutes despite even a direct conflict with matters for which the judiciary
had already exercised its power;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     u.    In conducting an evaluation,
as the Supreme Court observed in State v. Loftin, 157 N.J. 253 (1999), the
Supreme Court remains mindful of the obligation to uphold a legislative
enactment absent constitutional repugnance;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     v.    Amidst the affordable
housing emergency facing the State, it is necessary for the Legislature to
enhance the ability of a tax lien holder to foreclose the right of redemption
by, in addition to service by publication, requiring service by certified mail
instead of personal service;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     w.   Requiring service by certified
mail instead of personal service enables tax lien holders to repurpose over
300,000 abandoned, vacant, or foreclosed properties that may be used for the
production of affordable housing; provide a solution to the States severe
affordable housing shortage; and reduce the municipal, taxpayer, and renter
burden for unpaid property taxes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     x.    Such legislation
represents a significant government interest, which squarely comports with
Tyler v. Hennepin County, 598 U.S. 631 (2023);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     y.    That significant government
interest is best served, in the spirit of comity and the public interest, by
collaboration among the coordinate branches of government; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     z.     Therefore, it is
necessary, in the public interest, and proper for the Legislature to establish
a ta<span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>rgeted State investment and legal
framework to accelerate the acquisition, rehabilitation, and conversion of
vacant, abandoned, and foreclosed properties into affordable housing, which can
improve neighborhood stability, expand homeownership, and support equitable

manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage of the property through the office of
the county sheriff or, in the alternative, through an Internet auction of the
property through the office of the county sheriff.  The final judgment shall
provide for a writ of execution to the sheriff of the county in which the
property is located and the holding of either a judicial sale or an Internet

Internet auction, and the owner and the owner's heirs shall have no claim
against the holder of the tax sale certificate for any equity in the property. 
The amount received through the judicial sale or the Internet auction, as
appropriate, shall be conclusively presumed to be the fair market value of the
property.  In the event that no one bids on the property through the judicial
sale or the Internet auction, and the owner of the tax sale certificate obtains
fee title from the sheriff, it shall be conclusively presumed that there is no
equity in the property.  In the event that the sheriff has not established an

court in the final judgment of foreclosure.  The sheriff shall deduct the costs
to the office of the county sheriff of holding the judicial sale or the
Internet auction, as appropriate, which shall have been withheld by the sheriff

Attorney General, a land bank entity or a qualified housing nonprofit that
violates the bill is to be subject to a complaint at the discretion of any
person or entity, including a developer, residential tenant, or another land
bank entity or qualified housing nonprofit, directly and adversely affected by
a violation of the bill, if the affected person or entity files a complaint
with the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division within 12 months of the

a civil penalty equal to not less than 50 percent of the grant or loan provided
by the agency, reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, expenses for expert
witnesses, and other related fees and expenses incurred in proving a violation

deter violations of the bill.  </span></p>

law), and the In Rem Tax Foreclosure Act (1948), P.L.1948, c.96 (C.54:5-104.29
et seq.) (In Rem Tax Act), to reduce the time period, after which, a
municipality, or its assignee or transferee, or other person that acquires a
tax sale certificate, may institute an action to foreclose the right of
redemption.  The bill reduces the time period to from six months to three
months for a municipality, or its assignee or transferee, which is the
purchaser of a tax lien, and from two years to one year for all other persons.</p>

publication and by regular and certified mail, unless the notice by certified
mail is returned as undeliverable or the service recipients address is
disputed by that recipient.  The bill requires that notice of the action is to
be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality where
the affected lands are located.  If there is no newspaper of general
circulation in the municipality, the bill requires that the plaintiff publish
the notice on the Internet website of a newspaper that is targeted to reach
readers residing in the municipality where the affected lands are located. 
Within seven days of the date of publication of the notice of foreclosure, the bill
requires that the plaintiff serve a copy of the notice by regular and certified
mail to any person, or business or government entity, entitled to notice of the
foreclosure under the tax sale law or the In Rem Tax Act, respectively.  The bill
requires the notice to state that an answer is to be filed within 35 days of
the date of publication, or the date of the mailing of the notice, whichever is
later. </span></p>
