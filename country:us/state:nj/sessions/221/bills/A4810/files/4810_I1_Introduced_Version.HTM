(4)  If the court finds that a detained or embargoed drug or device is adulterated, outdated or misbranded, that drug or device, after entry of the decree, shall be destroyed at the expense of the owner under the supervision of a board representative and all court costs and fees, storage and other proper expenses shall be borne by the owner of that drug or device.  When the outdating, adulteration or misbranding can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the drug or device, the court, after entry of the decree and after the costs, fees and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond has been posted, may direct that the drug or device be delivered to the owner thereof for labeling or processing under the supervision of a board representative.  Expense of that supervision shall be paid by the owner.  The bond shall be returned to the owner of the drug or device on representation to the court by the board that the drug or device is no longer in violation of the embargo and the expense of supervision has been paid. d.    Except as otherwise provided to the contrary, the board shall exercise all of its duties, powers and authority in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2003, c.280, s.9) 3.    Section 25 of P.L.2003, c.280 (C.45:14-64) is amended to read as follows: 25.  The provisions of this act regulating collaborative drug therapy management shall not apply to : a.    any pharmacist practicing in a hospital, provided that prescribing within these institutions takes place under the guidance of a pharmacy and therapeutics committee in accordance with procedures as determined by regulations jointly promulgated by the board and the State Board of Medical Examiners ; and b.    a clinical pharmacist authorized to provide comprehensive medication management to a medically complex pediatric patient, pursuant to the provisions of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2003, c.280, s.25) 4.    (New section)  The Commissioner of Human Services shall apply for such State plan amendments or waivers as may be necessary to implement the provisions of section 1 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and to secure federal reimbursement for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program. 5.    (New section)  The Commissioner of Human Services and the New Jersey State Board of Pharmacy shall, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt rules and regulations as necessary to implement this act. 6.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the six month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires the NJ FamilyCare program to provide reimbursement for comprehensive medication management (CMM) services when provided by a licensed clinical pharmacist for a medically complex pediatric patient.  CMM services is defined as a standard of care by which a clinical pharmacist assesses each of a patients medications, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements, to determine that each is appropriate, effective, and safe, given the patients medical conditions, comorbidities, and other medications.  Comprehensive medication management services are provided by a clinical pharmacist as part of a patients health care team. The bill defines a clinical pharmacist as a licensed pharmacist who has completed a clinical residency to acquire expertise in the therapeutic use of medications to ensure optimal patient health outcomes.  Clinical pharmacists work as part of a patients team of healthcare professionals to provide medication therapy evaluations and recommendations to patients and healthcare providers. CMM services for which a clinical pharmacist would receive NJ FamilyCare reimbursement will include: 1.     comprehensive reviews of a pediatric patients prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements; 2.     development and implementation of patient-specific medication action plans; 3.     ongoing monitoring of patient adherence to the patient-specific medication action plan; 4.     follow-up consultations and services necessary to ensure the efficacy and safety of the patient-specific medication action plan; and 5.     any other CMM services deemed necessary by the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (the division) in the Department of Human Services and the Board of Pharmacy for the appropriate care of a medically complex pediatric patient. The bill directs the division to enter into value-based contracts with licensed clinical pharmacists in order to reimburse for CMM services provided for medically complex pediatric patients.  The division also will establish a quality assurance program in order to monitor and evaluate the outcomes and efficacy of the CMM services provided, and ensure that these services align with the divisions value-based payment strategies. The division and the New Jersey State Board of Pharmacy in the Division of Consumer Affairs will designate the educational, training, and credentialing requirements for licensed clinical pharmacists to provide CMM services. The bill also amends The New Jersey Pharmacy Practice Act, P.L.2003, c.280 (C.45:14-40 et seq.), to specify that a licensed clinical pharmacist who satisfies the credentialing requirements for the provision of CMM services will not be required to enter into a written agreement with a licensed physician in order to provide CMM services.  The bill further amends section 25 of P.L.2003, c.280 to provide that the statutory provisions regulating collaborative drug therapy management will not apply to the provision of CMM services, as provided by a licensed clinical pharmacist.

STATEMENT This bill requires the NJ FamilyCare program to provide reimbursement for comprehensive medication management (CMM) services when provided by a licensed clinical pharmacist for a medically complex pediatric patient.  CMM services is defined as a standard of care by which a clinical pharmacist assesses each of a patients medications, including prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements, to determine that each is appropriate, effective, and safe, given the patients medical conditions, comorbidities, and other medications.  Comprehensive medication management services are provided by a clinical pharmacist as part of a patients health care team. The bill defines a clinical pharmacist as a licensed pharmacist who has completed a clinical residency to acquire expertise in the therapeutic use of medications to ensure optimal patient health outcomes.  Clinical pharmacists work as part of a patients team of healthcare professionals to provide medication therapy evaluations and recommendations to patients and healthcare providers. CMM services for which a clinical pharmacist would receive NJ FamilyCare reimbursement will include: 1.     comprehensive reviews of a pediatric patients prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements; 2.     development and implementation of patient-specific medication action plans; 3.     ongoing monitoring of patient adherence to the patient-specific medication action plan; 4.     follow-up consultations and services necessary to ensure the efficacy and safety of the patient-specific medication action plan; and 5.     any other CMM services deemed necessary by the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (the division) in the Department of Human Services and the Board of Pharmacy for the appropriate care of a medically complex pediatric patient. The bill directs the division to enter into value-based contracts with licensed clinical pharmacists in order to reimburse for CMM services provided for medically complex pediatric patients.  The division also will establish a quality assurance program in order to monitor and evaluate the outcomes and efficacy of the CMM services provided, and ensure that these services align with the divisions value-based payment strategies. The division and the New Jersey State Board of Pharmacy in the Division of Consumer Affairs will designate the educational, training, and credentialing requirements for licensed clinical pharmacists to provide CMM services. The bill also amends The New Jersey Pharmacy Practice Act, P.L.2003, c.280 (C.45:14-40 et seq.), to specify that a licensed clinical pharmacist who satisfies the credentialing requirements for the provision of CMM services will not be required to enter into a written agreement with a licensed physician in order to provide CMM services.  The bill further amends section 25 of P.L.2003, c.280 to provide that the statutory provisions regulating collaborative drug therapy management will not apply to the provision of CMM services, as provided by a licensed clinical pharmacist.
