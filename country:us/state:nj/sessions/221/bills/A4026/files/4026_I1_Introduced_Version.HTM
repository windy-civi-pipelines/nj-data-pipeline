The fund is intended to operate consistent with federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.115).  The fund shall be a trust, trust account, or custodial account, the assets of which shall be deemed an arrangement equivalent to a trust for all legal purposes, and shall be established by means of appropriate documentation so as to comply with and be exempt from taxation under applicable provisions of federal and State law. The purpose of the fund shall include, but may not be limited to, lessening the burdens of government by providing a fund through which a public entity may contribute, transfer, or sell its revenue-producing assets to a segregated or commingled account and share the risks and benefits of the performance of those assets, to maximize the performance and long-term value of those assets, which value shall be known as the special asset value of the conveyed assets and shall act to increase the pension funded ratio of the benefitting public entity.  Collectively, the special asset value of all assets held by the fund shall be known as the funds special asset value. The fund shall be administered by an administrator retained, appointed, or procured by the Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund.  The assets of the fund shall be maintained as a separate account segregated from all other funds of the State, the administrator and the non-State public employers participating in State-administered retirement systems.  The fund shall be legally independent and separate, regardless of its treatment for tax, accounting, reporting, securities law, or other purposes.

The fund shall be established to receive, acquire, and improve assets and to issue certificates of trust conveying beneficial ownership of those assets to the State-administered retirement system or systems in which the public entities participate.  Assets in the fund shall be maintained in one or more segregated subaccounts in a manner determined by the administrator.  The comingling of any assets or holdings in a subaccount shall not alter any underlying beneficial interest assigned in certificates of trust issued pursuant to this act. The transfer agreement may permit the optimization of the asset for conveyance, in part or in whole.  Only that portion of the conveyed asset that is net of financing costs, amounts deposited into the investment account, and other distributions made to, or on behalf of the public entity shall be evidenced by certificates of trust and credited to the holding account of the Common Pension Fund as provided in section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Whereas the funds asset distributions, net of financing costs and any distributions to, or on behalf of the public entity, shall be deposited into the investment account of the Common Pension Fund as provided in section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill).

(C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill), which review shall be transmitted to the board and the public entity and available for public review; (2)   the public entity shall, within 180 days of receipt of the report produced pursuant to the 360 review, undertake remedial action as necessary to address the emergent conditions, including, but not limited to: (a)  funding necessary capital and operational improvements through (i) necessary legislative or executive action to effectuate an increase in the charges, rates, or fees that will be paid for services generated by the public asset by users in the applicable jurisdiction or service area, (ii) entering into financing agreements, (iii) applying for and receiving grants, donations or other financial assistance from available public or private sources, (iv) procuring qualified vendors to make necessary improvements, or (v) any other action necessary to secure such funding.  Any action proposed to be undertaken by a public entity pursuant to this subparagraph shall be reviewed and approved as sufficient to correct the emergent condition by the Department of Environmental Protection; (b)  entering into a sale or long-term lease of the asset pursuant to applicable State law and any local ordinances or regulations, including under the Water Infrastructure Protection Act, P.L.2015, c.18 (C.58:30-1 et seq.) or under any other law governing applicable public-private partnership agreements, as appropriate; or (c)  propose the asset for conveyance to the New Jersey Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund pursuant to subsections a. and b. of this section; and (3)   the public entity shall provide notice to the public of the remedial action chosen to be undertaken pursuant to this section on its official Internet website no later than 180 days of receipt of the report produced pursuant to the 360 review.  If an applicable official website does not exist, the public entity shall contact the Department of Community Affairs, and the notice shall be published on the official Internet website of the Department of Community Affairs. d.  Beneficial interests of 25 percent or more in a public asset held by the New Jersey Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund may not be granted by the fund to a private entity until after the first day of the fifth year following conveyance of the asset to the fund. 8.  (New section)  a.  (1)   An asset proposed for conveyance to, or acquisition by, the fund shall be valued by an independent valuation agent pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, and shall be revalued periodically if requested by the administrator, which revaluation shall occur at least once but not more than quarterly in any State fiscal year, whether discretionary or otherwise, or more frequently, as deemed necessary by the board. (2)   Upon receipt of a written notice by an entity of its intention to make an asset conveyance, sale, or exchange, which notice shall identify the asset, the administrator shall contract for the services of a qualified independent valuation agent to evaluate and conduct a valuation of the proposed asset. The qualified independent valuation agent shall issue a report representing its opinion as to the valuation of the asset in accordance with an asset conveyance, sale, or exchange. The asset value shall exclude proceeds counted in any prior actuarial valuation as a receivable and may be in an amount less any costs associated with consummating the asset conveyance. An asset conveyance shall not be effectuated until after the report has been issued and both the administrator, upon approval from the board, and the public entity accept the proposed value.  If either rejects the proposed value, the conveyance, sale, or exchange shall not be effectuated, and any written agreement for the conveyance of an asset shall be void. b.  The valuation as set forth in the transfer agreement shall serve as the basis for the beneficial interest assigned in corresponding certificates of trust to the State administered retirement accounts, accounting for the fair market value of the asset, less any costs associated with consummating the asset conveyance and any distributions to, or on behalf of the public entity including deposits to the investment account. Upon execution of an asset transfer agreement, and pursuant thereto, the administrator shall provide for the transfer into the fund of the asset.  Ownership in the trust fund shall be delineated by units which shall be evidenced by certificates issued by the trust fund to the State-administered retirement systems. During such time as an asset remains in the fund, all new assets acquired by or for the asset shall be owned by the fund, the beneficial interests in which assets shall be in such amounts as are dictated by the certificates of trust, except those assets which may only be held, licensed, acquired, or procured by a public entity making the conveyance, in which case such assets shall be held, licensed, acquired, or procured thereby on behalf of and for the benefit of the fund. 9.    (New section)  a.  In order to receive the asset contribution on behalf of the retirement systems, a Common Pension Fund is hereby established within the Division of Investment in the Department of the Treasury.  The Common Pension Fund shall constitute part of each retirement system and the participating trust through which each retirement system is funded.  Only the retirement systems and the trusts through which they are funded shall have an interest in the Common Pension Fund.  The Common Pension Fund shall satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(24) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.401(a)(24)), as amended, in accordance with Revenue Ruling 81-100, as amended by Revenue Ruling 2004-67 and Revenue Ruling 2011-1, and the requirements for exemption under section 501(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.501(a)), as amended. Consistent with section 401(a)(24) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.401(a)(24)), as amended, regulations of the United States Department of the Treasury, and other guidance of the federal Internal Revenue Service, each retirement system shall participate in the Common Pension Fund.  No part of the corpus or income of the Common Pension Fund that equitably belongs to a retirement system or a trust of the retirement system may be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members or beneficiaries entitled to benefits under such retirement system or trust of the retirement system. b.  Upon the establishment of the Common Pension Fund, there shall be established two subaccounts therein as the asset holdings account and investment account for the following purposes: (1)   the certificates of trust shall be deposited into an asset holdings account. As provided in section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill), the ICARE funds board solely shall manage the asset holdings account and shall make deposits therein, invest amounts therein, make requisition and payment for costs incurred in the operation and administration of the funds assets, and otherwise manage the asset holdings account.  All interest in the assets deposited in the asset holdings account shall be qualified plan assets subject to the requirements of sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ss.401(a) and 501(a)), as amended, but shall not be assets managed by the Division of Investment for the benefit of the retirement systems under N.J.S.18A:66-61, section 14 of P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-14), or section 32 of P.L.1954, c.84 (C.43:15A-32) until any such assets have been transferred from the asset holdings account to the investment account; (2)   proceeds in amounts determined by the fund shall be transferred from the asset holdings account to the investment account on a periodic basis and such proceeds shall constitute the distributions of the funds asset.  Such proceeds transferred together with all investments thereof and investment earnings thereon shall be available solely to and for the benefit of the retirement systems.  The investment account shall be managed and invested by the Director of the Division of Investment pursuant to the authority, responsibilities, and duties set forth in P.L.1950, c.270 (C.52:18A-79 et seq.), subject to the oversight of the State Investment Council, pursuant to the authority of P.L.1950, c.270 (C.52:18A-79 et seq.).  The Director of the Division of Investment shall have full discretion to distribute proceeds and all investments thereof and investment earnings thereon from the investment account into investment vehicles managed by the Division of Investment on behalf of the retirement systems.  The investment account may be further subdivided into subaccounts in the discretion of the Director of the Division of Investment for purposes of investing in different types of investments; and (3)   notwithstanding any provision of this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill), or any other provision of law to the contrary, the Director of the Division of Investment and the State Investment Council shall not have any responsibility for the asset holdings account of the Common Pension Fund and shall not be liable for any claims, demands, suits, actions, damages, judgments, costs, charges, or expenses, including court costs or attorneys' fees in any way related to such account.  Notwithstanding the establishment of the Common Pension Fund in the Division of Investment, the Director of the Division of Investment, the Division of Investment, and the State Investment Council shall not have any authority to manage the funds assets or the asset holdings account. c.  Upon receipt of the certificates of trust to be contributed to the holding account and any assets to be contributed to the investment account, the Director of the Division of Investment shall: (1) invest and manage all assets in the investment account; (2) make distributions of proceeds and investment earnings thereon from the investment account into investment vehicles managed by the Division of Investment for the sole benefit of the retirement systems; and (3) make distributions of proceeds and investment earnings thereon from the investment account to the retirement systems from the Common Pension Fund  to be used by each retirement system for any legitimate purpose of such retirement system; provided that any distribution under this part shall be made on a simultaneous and pro rata basis to the retirement systems, which pro rata basis shall be based on each retirement system's relative equitable interest in the asset contribution. d.  The portion of the asset contribution allocated to each retirement system shall increase the funded ratio with respect to eligible members of such retirement system, provided, however, all amounts in the investment account, to the extent of the interest of each retirement system therein, may be distributed by the Director of the Division of Investment to the retirement systems from the Common Pension Fund and used by each retirement system for any legitimate purpose of such retirement system, provided that any such distribution shall be made on a simultaneous and pro rata basis to the retirement systems, which pro rata basis shall be based on each retirement system's relative equitable interest in the asset contribution. For the purpose of this subsection, the funded ratio shall be the ratio of the actuarial value of assets plus the value of the special asset, determined in accordance with section 38 of P.L.2010, c.1 (C.43:3C-14), to the actuarially determined accrued liabilities expressed as a percentage. 10.  (New section)  a.  The beneficial interests in enterprise assets of the fund shall be accounted for in certificates of trust, which shall outline the terms by which that beneficial interest shall be realized and exercised. Certificates of trust shall be held in a Common Pension Fund on behalf of the State-administered retirement system. For the avoidance of doubt, the transfer agreement may permit the optimization of the asset for conveyance, in part or in whole.  Only that portion of the conveyed asset, excluding costs associated with conveyance, financing costs, amounts distributed to, or on behalf of the public entity, including deposits into the investment account, shall be evidenced by certificates of trust and credited to the holding account of the Common Pension Fund as provided in section 9 of P.L.    , c. (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Whereas the funds asset distributions, net of financing costs and any distributions to, or on behalf of the public entity, shall be deposited to the investment account of the Common Pension Fund as provided in section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C. )(pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  Upon acceptance of an asset into the fund, the administrator shall assign the entire beneficial interest in that asset to the State-administered retirement system, as designated in a transfer agreement.  A holder of a certificate of trust may sell or convey those beneficial interests to other entities, in consultation with the administrator and the board, so long as such sale does not impair the tax status of the trust or assets held by the trust, and for the purpose of ensuring the long-term viability of a retirement system or improving the financial returns and liquidity thereof. c.  The administrator shall ensure that the terms and conditions of the certificates of trust allow the underlying assets to be comingled or divided amongst accounts and subaccounts of the fund, or to be distributed to outside entities by the administrator, as necessary, to provide for the most efficient management of the assets practicable, including the sale of certificates to other pension systems, so long as such sale does not impair the tax status of the fund or the assets. The terms of the certificates of trust shall provide for a continuous accurate reflection of the proportional beneficial interest in each asset pursuant to the certificates of trust for the various fund subaccounts. d.  Beneficial interests assigned by certificates of trust shall be in the same amount as the accepted fair market value of the assets, which shall exclude any fees, charges, or expense reimbursements provided in section 6 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill) and exclude amounts deposited to the investment account from, or associated with, the conveyed asset.  The certificates of trust shall be issued to, or for the benefit of, the State-administered retirement system pursuant to written agreement.  If the agreement designates more than one State-administered retirement system as the intended beneficiary of the transfer, the agreement shall also apportion the fund interest among them, and the fund interest shall be issued to, or for the benefit of, them in such proportion. 11.  Section 3 of P.L.2015, c.18 (C.58:30-3) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in this act, Administrator means a person or an entity, including the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank, as permitted under section 503 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.503), that the board shall retain, appoint or procure, to administer the affairs of the fund as a fiduciary and subject to and under the supervision of the board. 360 review means a comprehensive analysis that includes an assessment of a public entitys fiscal condition, an inventory of asset optimization opportunities as established in section 6 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill), and an initial due diligence review of any public asset proposed for conveyance to the New Jersey Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund, established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill).

STATEMENT This bill, known as the New Jersey Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund Act, establishes a trust fund for the conveyance of certain assets for the benefit of the State-administered retirement systems. The fund, known as the Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise (ICARE) Fund, is established as an instrumentality of the State to exercise public and essential governmental functions. The purpose of the fund is to lessen the burdens of government by providing a fund through which a public entity may contribute, transfer or sell its revenue-producing assets, to a segregated or commingled account and share the risks and benefits of the performance of those assets, to maximize the performance and long-term value of those assets and to benefit the public entity. The fund will be administered by an Administrator retained, appointed, or procured by the Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund.  The assets of the fund will be maintained as a separate account segregated from all other funds of the State, the administrator and the non-State public employers participating in State-administered retirement systems.  The fund will be legally independent and separate, regardless of its treatment for tax, accounting, reporting, securities law, or other purposes. No person will use or authorize the use of the assets in the fund, or the investment earnings, for any purpose other than for the maximization of the value of the assets in the fund, including meeting or exceeding the level of service required to operate the asset pursuant to State and federal law and regulations for the safety of the public and the environment, and for the benefit of members and retirees in the State-administered retirement systems, and for the reasonable costs of administering the fund. The ICARE Fund will have a board of five members as follows: a member of the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank, a member of the Division of Investments or their designee, who will serve ex officio, and three members of the public appointed by the Governor.  Members appointed by the Governor should have experience and expertise in ERISA law and laws governing public pension plans, experience and expertise in pension finance or experience and expertise in the construction trades. Each public member will be appointed for a term of three years, with staggered terms.  Members will remain active until their successor is qualified.  The chairperson will be determined by the Governor and the director of the Division of Investment will serve as treasurer of the board and as vice chairperson of the board.  The position of secretary will be elected from among the three public members of the board. The term for secretary will be three years. The board will be constituted as an instrumentality of the State exercising public and essential governmental functions, and the exercise by the board of the powers conferred by this bill will be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the State. The members of the ICARE Fund will serve without compensation, but the fund will reimburse the members for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties The bill establishes an advisory committee to the board comprised of each municipality or county which is a benefitting public entity.  The advisory committee members will serve for two years.  Members of the advisory committee will be appointed by the secretary of the board upon the recommendation from the executive of the public entity.  All public information that is distributed to board members relative to board meetings will also be provided simultaneously to the advisory committee members.  The purpose of the advisory committee is to provide the board with advice and information relevant to local systems.  The advisory committee will not have any voting or veto authority over the board.  The advisory committee members will receive no compensation. The fund administrator will have a fiduciary duty to maximize the value of an asset over the long-term, to the holders of certificates of trust issued pursuant to this bill.  The administrator will ensure that each asset meets or exceeds the level of service required to operate the asset pursuant to State and federal law and regulations for the safety of the public and the environment. The bill provides that a public entity may convey to the fund an asset held by the public entity.  The conveyance will be governed by a transfer agreement, which will be proposed by the administrator, in consultation with the board, and approved by the public entity.  Only that portion of the conveyed asset that is net of financing costs and amounts deposited into the investment account or other distributions made to, or on behalf of the public entity will be evidenced by certificates of trust and credited to the holding account of the Common Pension Fund as provided by this bill.  Asset contributions on behalf of the public entity and the funds asset distributions will be deposited in the investment account of the Common Pension Fund. The State-administered retirement systems will not be required or permitted to pay any expenses incurred in connection with the conveyance of an asset pursuant to this act. An asset proposed for conveyance to the fund will be valued by an independent valuation agent and be revalued periodically.  The valuation agent will issue a report representing its opinion as to the valuation of the asset in accordance with an asset conveyance.  An asset conveyance will not be effectuated until after the report has been issued and both the fund manager, upon approval from the board, and the public entity or non-public entity accept the proposed value.  If either rejects the proposed value, the conveyance will not be effectuated, and any written agreement for the conveyance of an asset will be void. The bill amends the Water Infrastructure Protection Act, to allow a municipality with a water or wastewater asset under emergent conditions to include conveyance of the asset to the fund as an option under that law. The bill appropriates $20,000,000 to the ICARE fund for the operating and administrative expenses of the fund and for the performance by the administrator and the board of their responsibilities.

The asset value shall exclude proceeds counted in any prior actuarial valuation as a receivable and may be in an amount less any costs associated with consummating the asset conveyance. An asset conveyance shall not be effectuated until after the report has been issued and both the administrator, upon approval from the board, and the public entity accept the proposed value.  If either rejects the proposed value, the conveyance, sale, or exchange shall not be effectuated, and any written agreement for the conveyance of an asset shall be void. b.  The valuation as set forth in the transfer agreement shall serve as the basis for the beneficial interest assigned in corresponding certificates of trust to the State administered retirement accounts, accounting for the fair market value of the asset, less any costs associated with consummating the asset conveyance and any distributions to, or on behalf of the public entity including deposits to the investment account. Upon execution of an asset transfer agreement, and pursuant thereto, the administrator shall provide for the transfer into the fund of the asset.  Ownership in the trust fund shall be delineated by units which shall be evidenced by certificates issued by the trust fund to the State-administered retirement systems. During such time as an asset remains in the fund, all new assets acquired by or for the asset shall be owned by the fund, the beneficial interests in which assets shall be in such amounts as are dictated by the certificates of trust, except those assets which may only be held, licensed, acquired, or procured by a public entity making the conveyance, in which case such assets shall be held, licensed, acquired, or procured thereby on behalf of and for the benefit of the fund. 9.    (New section)  a.  In order to receive the asset contribution on behalf of the retirement systems, a Common Pension Fund is hereby established within the Division of Investment in the Department of the Treasury.  The Common Pension Fund shall constitute part of each retirement system and the participating trust through which each retirement system is funded.  Only the retirement systems and the trusts through which they are funded shall have an interest in the Common Pension Fund.  The Common Pension Fund shall satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(24) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.401(a)(24)), as amended, in accordance with Revenue Ruling 81-100, as amended by Revenue Ruling 2004-67 and Revenue Ruling 2011-1, and the requirements for exemption under section 501(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.501(a)), as amended. Consistent with section 401(a)(24) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.401(a)(24)), as amended, regulations of the United States Department of the Treasury, and other guidance of the federal Internal Revenue Service, each retirement system shall participate in the Common Pension Fund.  No part of the corpus or income of the Common Pension Fund that equitably belongs to a retirement system or a trust of the retirement system may be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members or beneficiaries entitled to benefits under such retirement system or trust of the retirement system. b.  Upon the establishment of the Common Pension Fund, there shall be established two subaccounts therein as the asset holdings account and investment account for the following purposes: (1)   the certificates of trust shall be deposited into an asset holdings account. As provided in section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill), the ICARE funds board solely shall manage the asset holdings account and shall make deposits therein, invest amounts therein, make requisition and payment for costs incurred in the operation and administration of the funds assets, and otherwise manage the asset holdings account.  All interest in the assets deposited in the asset holdings account shall be qualified plan assets subject to the requirements of sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. ss.401(a) and 501(a)), as amended, but shall not be assets managed by the Division of Investment for the benefit of the retirement systems under N.J.S.18A:66-61, section 14 of P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-14), or section 32 of P.L.1954, c.84 (C.43:15A-32) until any such assets have been transferred from the asset holdings account to the investment account; (2)   proceeds in amounts determined by the fund shall be transferred from the asset holdings account to the investment account on a periodic basis and such proceeds shall constitute the distributions of the funds asset.  Such proceeds transferred together with all investments thereof and investment earnings thereon shall be available solely to and for the benefit of the retirement systems.  The investment account shall be managed and invested by the Director of the Division of Investment pursuant to the authority, responsibilities, and duties set forth in P.L.1950, c.270 (C.52:18A-79 et seq.), subject to the oversight of the State Investment Council, pursuant to the authority of P.L.1950, c.270 (C.52:18A-79 et seq.).  The Director of the Division of Investment shall have full discretion to distribute proceeds and all investments thereof and investment earnings thereon from the investment account into investment vehicles managed by the Division of Investment on behalf of the retirement systems.  The investment account may be further subdivided into subaccounts in the discretion of the Director of the Division of Investment for purposes of investing in different types of investments; and (3)   notwithstanding any provision of this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill), or any other provision of law to the contrary, the Director of the Division of Investment and the State Investment Council shall not have any responsibility for the asset holdings account of the Common Pension Fund and shall not be liable for any claims, demands, suits, actions, damages, judgments, costs, charges, or expenses, including court costs or attorneys' fees in any way related to such account.  Notwithstanding the establishment of the Common Pension Fund in the Division of Investment, the Director of the Division of Investment, the Division of Investment, and the State Investment Council shall not have any authority to manage the funds assets or the asset holdings account. c.  Upon receipt of the certificates of trust to be contributed to the holding account and any assets to be contributed to the investment account, the Director of the Division of Investment shall: (1) invest and manage all assets in the investment account; (2) make distributions of proceeds and investment earnings thereon from the investment account into investment vehicles managed by the Division of Investment for the sole benefit of the retirement systems; and (3) make distributions of proceeds and investment earnings thereon from the investment account to the retirement systems from the Common Pension Fund  to be used by each retirement system for any legitimate purpose of such retirement system; provided that any distribution under this part shall be made on a simultaneous and pro rata basis to the retirement systems, which pro rata basis shall be based on each retirement system's relative equitable interest in the asset contribution. d.  The portion of the asset contribution allocated to each retirement system shall increase the funded ratio with respect to eligible members of such retirement system, provided, however, all amounts in the investment account, to the extent of the interest of each retirement system therein, may be distributed by the Director of the Division of Investment to the retirement systems from the Common Pension Fund and used by each retirement system for any legitimate purpose of such retirement system, provided that any such distribution shall be made on a simultaneous and pro rata basis to the retirement systems, which pro rata basis shall be based on each retirement system's relative equitable interest in the asset contribution. For the purpose of this subsection, the funded ratio shall be the ratio of the actuarial value of assets plus the value of the special asset, determined in accordance with section 38 of P.L.2010, c.1 (C.43:3C-14), to the actuarially determined accrued liabilities expressed as a percentage. 10.  (New section)  a.  The beneficial interests in enterprise assets of the fund shall be accounted for in certificates of trust, which shall outline the terms by which that beneficial interest shall be realized and exercised. Certificates of trust shall be held in a Common Pension Fund on behalf of the State-administered retirement system. For the avoidance of doubt, the transfer agreement may permit the optimization of the asset for conveyance, in part or in whole.  Only that portion of the conveyed asset, excluding costs associated with conveyance, financing costs, amounts distributed to, or on behalf of the public entity, including deposits into the investment account, shall be evidenced by certificates of trust and credited to the holding account of the Common Pension Fund as provided in section 9 of P.L.    , c. (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Whereas the funds asset distributions, net of financing costs and any distributions to, or on behalf of the public entity, shall be deposited to the investment account of the Common Pension Fund as provided in section 9 of P.L.    , c.    (C. )(pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  Upon acceptance of an asset into the fund, the administrator shall assign the entire beneficial interest in that asset to the State-administered retirement system, as designated in a transfer agreement.  A holder of a certificate of trust may sell or convey those beneficial interests to other entities, in consultation with the administrator and the board, so long as such sale does not impair the tax status of the trust or assets held by the trust, and for the purpose of ensuring the long-term viability of a retirement system or improving the financial returns and liquidity thereof. c.  The administrator shall ensure that the terms and conditions of the certificates of trust allow the underlying assets to be comingled or divided amongst accounts and subaccounts of the fund, or to be distributed to outside entities by the administrator, as necessary, to provide for the most efficient management of the assets practicable, including the sale of certificates to other pension systems, so long as such sale does not impair the tax status of the fund or the assets. The terms of the certificates of trust shall provide for a continuous accurate reflection of the proportional beneficial interest in each asset pursuant to the certificates of trust for the various fund subaccounts. d.  Beneficial interests assigned by certificates of trust shall be in the same amount as the accepted fair market value of the assets, which shall exclude any fees, charges, or expense reimbursements provided in section 6 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill) and exclude amounts deposited to the investment account from, or associated with, the conveyed asset.  The certificates of trust shall be issued to, or for the benefit of, the State-administered retirement system pursuant to written agreement.  If the agreement designates more than one State-administered retirement system as the intended beneficiary of the transfer, the agreement shall also apportion the fund interest among them, and the fund interest shall be issued to, or for the benefit of, them in such proportion. 11.  Section 3 of P.L.2015, c.18 (C.58:30-3) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in this act, Administrator means a person or an entity, including the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank, as permitted under section 503 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.503), that the board shall retain, appoint or procure, to administer the affairs of the fund as a fiduciary and subject to and under the supervision of the board. 360 review means a comprehensive analysis that includes an assessment of a public entitys fiscal condition, an inventory of asset optimization opportunities as established in section 6 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill), and an initial due diligence review of any public asset proposed for conveyance to the New Jersey Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund, established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )(pending before the Legislature as this bill).

STATEMENT This bill, known as the New Jersey Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund Act, establishes a trust fund for the conveyance of certain assets for the benefit of the State-administered retirement systems. The fund, known as the Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise (ICARE) Fund, is established as an instrumentality of the State to exercise public and essential governmental functions. The purpose of the fund is to lessen the burdens of government by providing a fund through which a public entity may contribute, transfer or sell its revenue-producing assets, to a segregated or commingled account and share the risks and benefits of the performance of those assets, to maximize the performance and long-term value of those assets and to benefit the public entity. The fund will be administered by an Administrator retained, appointed, or procured by the Infrastructure Capital Asset Reassignment Enterprise Fund.  The assets of the fund will be maintained as a separate account segregated from all other funds of the State, the administrator and the non-State public employers participating in State-administered retirement systems.  The fund will be legally independent and separate, regardless of its treatment for tax, accounting, reporting, securities law, or other purposes. No person will use or authorize the use of the assets in the fund, or the investment earnings, for any purpose other than for the maximization of the value of the assets in the fund, including meeting or exceeding the level of service required to operate the asset pursuant to State and federal law and regulations for the safety of the public and the environment, and for the benefit of members and retirees in the State-administered retirement systems, and for the reasonable costs of administering the fund. The ICARE Fund will have a board of five members as follows: a member of the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank, a member of the Division of Investments or their designee, who will serve ex officio, and three members of the public appointed by the Governor.  Members appointed by the Governor should have experience and expertise in ERISA law and laws governing public pension plans, experience and expertise in pension finance or experience and expertise in the construction trades. Each public member will be appointed for a term of three years, with staggered terms.  Members will remain active until their successor is qualified.  The chairperson will be determined by the Governor and the director of the Division of Investment will serve as treasurer of the board and as vice chairperson of the board.  The position of secretary will be elected from among the three public members of the board. The term for secretary will be three years. The board will be constituted as an instrumentality of the State exercising public and essential governmental functions, and the exercise by the board of the powers conferred by this bill will be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the State. The members of the ICARE Fund will serve without compensation, but the fund will reimburse the members for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties The bill establishes an advisory committee to the board comprised of each municipality or county which is a benefitting public entity.  The advisory committee members will serve for two years.  Members of the advisory committee will be appointed by the secretary of the board upon the recommendation from the executive of the public entity.  All public information that is distributed to board members relative to board meetings will also be provided simultaneously to the advisory committee members.  The purpose of the advisory committee is to provide the board with advice and information relevant to local systems.  The advisory committee will not have any voting or veto authority over the board.  The advisory committee members will receive no compensation. The fund administrator will have a fiduciary duty to maximize the value of an asset over the long-term, to the holders of certificates of trust issued pursuant to this bill.  The administrator will ensure that each asset meets or exceeds the level of service required to operate the asset pursuant to State and federal law and regulations for the safety of the public and the environment. The bill provides that a public entity may convey to the fund an asset held by the public entity.  The conveyance will be governed by a transfer agreement, which will be proposed by the administrator, in consultation with the board, and approved by the public entity.  Only that portion of the conveyed asset that is net of financing costs and amounts deposited into the investment account or other distributions made to, or on behalf of the public entity will be evidenced by certificates of trust and credited to the holding account of the Common Pension Fund as provided by this bill.  Asset contributions on behalf of the public entity and the funds asset distributions will be deposited in the investment account of the Common Pension Fund. The State-administered retirement systems will not be required or permitted to pay any expenses incurred in connection with the conveyance of an asset pursuant to this act. An asset proposed for conveyance to the fund will be valued by an independent valuation agent and be revalued periodically.  The valuation agent will issue a report representing its opinion as to the valuation of the asset in accordance with an asset conveyance.  An asset conveyance will not be effectuated until after the report has been issued and both the fund manager, upon approval from the board, and the public entity or non-public entity accept the proposed value.  If either rejects the proposed value, the conveyance will not be effectuated, and any written agreement for the conveyance of an asset will be void. The bill amends the Water Infrastructure Protection Act, to allow a municipality with a water or wastewater asset under emergent conditions to include conveyance of the asset to the fund as an option under that law. The bill appropriates $20,000,000 to the ICARE fund for the operating and administrative expenses of the fund and for the performance by the administrator and the board of their responsibilities.
