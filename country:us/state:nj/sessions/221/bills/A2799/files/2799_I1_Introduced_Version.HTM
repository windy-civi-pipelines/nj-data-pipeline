format, manner of collation, or volume of a government record embodied in the
form of printed matter to be inspected, examined, or copied pursuant to this
section is such that the record cannot be reproduced by ordinary document
copying equipment in ordinary business size or involves an extraordinary
expenditure of time and effort to accommodate the request, the public agency
may charge, in addition to the actual cost of duplicating the record, a special
service charge that shall be reasonable and shall be based upon the actual
direct cost of providing the copy or copies; provided, however, that in the
case of a municipality, rates for the duplication of particular records when
the actual cost of copying exceeds the foregoing rates shall be established in
advance by ordinance.  The requestor shall have the opportunity to review and
object to the charge prior to it being incurred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A custodian shall permit
access to a government record and provide a copy thereof in the medium
requested if the public agency maintains the record in that medium.  If the
public agency does not maintain the record in the medium requested, the
custodian shall either convert the record to the medium requested or provide a
copy in some other meaningful medium.  If a request is for a record: (1) in a
medium not routinely used by the agency; (2) not routinely developed or
maintained by an agency; or (3) requiring a substantial amount of manipulation
or programming of information technology, the agency may charge, in addition to
the actual cost of duplication, a special charge that shall be reasonable and
shall be based on the cost for any extensive use of information technology, or
for the labor cost of personnel providing the service, that is actually
incurred by the agency or attributable to the agency for the programming,
clerical, and supervisory assistance required, or both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Immediate access
ordinarily shall be granted to budgets, bills, vouchers, contracts, including
collective negotiations agreements and individual employment contracts, and
public employee salary and overtime information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The custodian of a
public agency shall adopt a form for the use of any person who requests access
to a government record held or controlled by the public agency.  The form shall
provide space for the name, address, and phone number of the requestor and a
brief description of the government record sought.  The form shall include
space for the custodian to indicate which record will be made available, when
the record will be available, and the fees to be charged.  The form shall also
include the following: (1) specific directions and procedures for requesting a
record; (2) a statement as to whether prepayment of fees or a deposit is
required; (3) the time period within which the public agency is required by
P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, to make the
record available; (4) a statement of the requestor's right to challenge a
decision by the public agency to deny access and the procedure for filing an
appeal; (5) space for the custodian to list reasons if a request is denied in
whole or in part; (6) space for the requestor to sign and date the form; (7)
space for the custodian to sign and date the form if the request is fulfilled
or denied.  The custodian may require a deposit against costs for reproducing
documents sought through an anonymous request whenever the custodian
anticipates that the information thus requested will cost in excess of $5 to
reproduce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    A request for access to
a government record shall be in writing and hand-delivered, mailed, transmitted
electronically, or otherwise conveyed to the appropriate custodian.  A
custodian shall promptly comply with a request to inspect, examine, copy, or
provide a copy of a government record.  If the custodian is unable to comply
with a request for access, the custodian shall indicate the specific basis
therefor on the request form and promptly return it to the requestor.  The
custodian shall sign and date the form and provide the requestor with a copy thereof. 
If the custodian of a government record asserts that part of a particular
record is exempt from public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et
seq.) as amended and supplemented, the custodian shall delete or excise from a
copy of the record that portion which the custodian asserts is exempt from
access and shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the record.  If the
government record requested is temporarily unavailable because it is in use or
in storage, the custodian shall so advise the requestor and shall make
arrangements to promptly make available a copy of the record.  If a request for
access to a government record would substantially disrupt agency operations,
the custodian may deny access to the record after attempting to reach a
reasonable solution with the requestor that accommodates the interests of the
requestor and the agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Any officer or employee
of a public agency who receives a request for access to a government record

requestor to the custodian of the record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     (1)  Unless a shorter
time period is otherwise provided by statute, regulation, or executive order, a
custodian of a government record shall grant access to a government record or deny
a request for access to a government record as soon as possible, but not later
than seven business days after receiving the request, provided that the record
is currently available and not in storage or archived.  In the event a
custodian fails to respond within seven business days after receiving a
request, the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless
the requestor has elected not to provide a name, address or telephone number,
or other means of contacting the requestor.  If the requestor has elected not
to provide a name, address, or telephone number, or other means of contacting
the requestor, the custodian shall not be required to respond until the
requestor reappears before the custodian seeking a response to the original request. 
If the government record is in storage or archived, the requestor shall be so
advised within seven business days after the custodian receives the request. 
The requestor shall be advised by the custodian when the record can be made
available.  If the record is not made available by that time, access shall be
deemed denied.</p>

pursuant to the laws of this State as a state of emergency, public health
emergency, or state of local disaster emergency, the deadlines by which to
respond to a request for, or grant or deny access to, a government record under
paragraph (1) of this subsection or subsection e. of this section shall not
apply, provided, however, that the custodian of a government record shall make
a reasonable effort, as the circumstances permit, to respond to a request for
access to a government record within seven business days or as soon as possible
thereafter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     A custodian shall post
prominently in public view in the part or parts of the office or offices of the
custodian that are open to or frequented by the public a statement that sets
forth in clear, concise and specific terms the right to appeal a denial of, or
failure to provide, access to a government record by any person for inspection,
