This bill would require a registered professional guardian, who is compensated for guardianship services, to personally meet with the ward not less than once every three weeks, or as deemed appropriate by the court. The bill further provides that a family member of the ward may, upon motion to the Court, request a report be prepared by a registered professional guardian concerning the condition of the ward and the condition of the ward's estate which has been subject to the guardian's possession or control as ordered by the court.
