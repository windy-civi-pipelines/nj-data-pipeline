The Board of Medical Examiners is directed to adopt rules and regulations that establish procedures for: 1)  physicians to report, document, and certify the uncompensated care and treatment for substance use disorders provided in a calendar year and the total number of patients who received care and treatment from the physician during that year; 2)  the board to verify that the reported uncompensated care and treatment for substance use disorders was provided to more than 10 percent of the physicians patients; and 3)  the board to notify the physician and the Department of Banking and Insurance that the physician qualifies for the medical malpractice insurance limit.
