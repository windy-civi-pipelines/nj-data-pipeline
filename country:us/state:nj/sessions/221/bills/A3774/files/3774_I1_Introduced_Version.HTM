class=HangingAnActChar> </span>establishing a conception to cradle pilot
program and supplementing Title 18A of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     A childs brain
develops faster from birth to age three than at any later period in life,
forming more than one million new neural connections every second.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    When babies have
nurturing relationships, early learning experiences, and good health and
nutrition, these neural connections are stimulated and strengthened, laying a
strong foundation for success in school and the workforce.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Unfortunately, too many
babies are not getting what they need, forming shaky foundations from which to
grow.  According to data from ZERO TO THREEs State of Babies Yearbook: 2019,
nearly half of Americas babies live in or near poverty, and many young
children face a range of risk factors that can impede positive development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Research shows that at
age two, toddlers from low-income families are already six months behind in
their language processing skills.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Gaps in education
outcomes start before entry to K-12 education and even before pre-kindergarten.
 However, most of the investments in early childhood start at ages four and
older.  By that time, the most crucial years of early brain development have
passed.  Without greater investment in the first three years, many children
will miss the opportunity to reach their full potential.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The State of New Jersey
has the widest gap in the nation between its better and lesser performing
schools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    African-American women
in New Jersey are nearly seven times more likely than a white woman to die from
pregnancy-related complications, more than double the nationwide rate, and a African-American
baby is three times more likely than a white baby to die before his or her
first birthday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Creating policies and
making investments in high-quality early learning programs and child care
services, supports and resources for parents, access to preventive health care
and nutrition programs, improvements in the health and birth outcomes for women
of color, and interventions for developmental delays and mental health issues
gets babies off to the healthy start they need to thrive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     It is in the public
interest of the State to advance programs and policies that promote healthy
development for infants and toddlers, and the establishment of a conception to
cradle program that will provide an integrated focus on early childhood
development, health, and social services in order to prioritize the needs of
infants, toddlers, and their families and build a Statewide foundation for the future
education, health, and life success of New Jerseys children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commissioner means the
Commissioner of Education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Department means the
Department of Education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  The Commissioner of Education
shall establish a five-year Conception to Cradle Pilot Program in the
Department of Education.  The objective of the pilot program shall be to
facilitate partnerships between public schools, community-based nonprofit
organizations, faith-based organizations, health and social services providers,
public and private universities, and State and local governmental agencies to: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  provide an integrated
focus on early childhood development, health and social services, educational
counseling, and community development; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) offer prenatal and
pediatric health and nutritional care to infants and toddlers from birth to age
three; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) actively engage families and
foster collaborative practices based on an individual communitys identified
need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the pilot program, 50 public
school with the worst student performance shall be selected to receive training
in providing community school services to infants and toddlers from birth to
age three, and shall be assigned a site coordinator who shall assist in the provision
of such services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  No later than three months
following the effective date of this act, the commissioner shall issue a
request for proposals to identify a qualified nonprofit organization, located
in the State whose mission is to facilitate the provision of high quality
community school services in New Jersey, to manage the pilot program.  Upon
selecting an organization to manage the pilot program, the commissioner shall
enter into a contract with that organization specifying its duties and
responsibilities including, but not limited to, those identified in section 4
of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  No later than six months
following the effective date of this act, the commissioner shall survey every
school district in the State to assess the extent to which public schools in
the school district can provide community school services to infants and
toddlers from birth to age three.  The survey shall obtain information
including, but not limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   identifying public
schools with the worst student performance in the school district that have an
interest in providing community school services; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) listing the entities with
which a school can enter into a partnership for the provision of services; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) detailing services that
are to be provided through the community school services program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a
five-year Conception to Cradle Pilot Program in the Department of Education
(DOE).  The objective of the pilot program is to facilitate partnerships
between public schools, community-based nonprofit organizations, faith-based
organizations, health and social services providers, public and private
universities, and State and local governmental agencies to: (1) provide an
integrated focus on early childhood development, health and social services,
educational counseling, and community development; (2) offer prenatal and
pediatric health and nutritional care to infants and toddlers from birth to age
three; and (3) actively engage families and foster collaborative practices
based on an individual communitys identified need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the pilot program, 50
public schools with the worst student performance are to be selected to receive
training in providing community school services to infants and toddlers from
birth to age three, and would be assigned a site coordinator to assist in the
provision of services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill stipulates that no
later than six months following the bills effective date, the Commissioner of
Education (commissioner) is to survey every school district in the State to assess
the extent to which public schools in the district can provide community school
services to infants and toddlers from birth to age three.  The survey is to:
(1) identify public schools with the worst student performance in the district
that have an interest in providing community school services; (2) list the
entities with which a school can enter into a partnership for the provision of
services; and (3) detail services that are to be provided through the community
school services program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the commissioner
would issue a request for proposals to identify a nonprofit organization
located in the State to manage the pilot program.  The selected organization
would be responsible for providing technical assistance to the public schools
participating in the pilot program, and may enter into an agreement with
another nonprofit entity to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities as
outlined in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The organization, in
coordination with the DOE, would develop an application procedure and specific
criteria for selecting the 50 public schools to participate in the program and
receive direct support from a site coordinator.  The selection criteria would
be posted on the DOEs website at least 20 days prior to the beginning of the application
period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In selecting the 50 public
schools to participate in the pilot program, priority is to be given to a
school that: has the worst student performance in its school district as
determined by standard assessment measures; and serves low-income and
under-resourced communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The organization would employ
and train individuals who would be assigned to serve as a site coordinator in a
public school selected to participate in the pilot program.  Those selected to
be site coordinators would be required to be employees of the organization, and
not the school they are assigned.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner would
annually enter into a contract with an independent entity to perform an audit
of the organizations accounts and financial transactions.  The audits, which
must be completed no later than five months following the organizations fiscal
year, would be posted on the DOEs website.  The bill also requires that the
commissioner enter into a contract with an independent entity to conduct an
evaluation of the pilot program.  The final report, which the commissioner
would forward to the Governor and the Legislature, would be due no later than
six months prior to the conclusion of the pilot program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes in
the DOE a nonlapsing fund known as the Conception to Cradle Pilot Program
Fund.  The fund is to consist of any funds that are appropriated by the
