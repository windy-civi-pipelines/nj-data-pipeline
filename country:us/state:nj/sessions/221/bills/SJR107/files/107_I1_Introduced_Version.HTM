SJR107 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION No. 107 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED APRIL 15, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  NILSA I. CRUZ-PEREZ District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) Senator  PATRICK J. DIEGNAN, JR. District 18 (Middlesex) Co-Sponsored by: Senators Johnson and McKnight SYNOPSIS Designates March of each year as Fibromuscular Dysplasia Awareness Month. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution designating the month of March of each year as Fibromuscular Dysplasia Awareness Month in New Jersey. Whereas, Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a disease that causes abnormal cell growth of the arterial wall.  FMD can lead to areas of narrowing (stenosis), beading, aneurysms, and dissections (tears) of the arterial wall; and Whereas, Until recently there has been very little progress in understanding the disease since it was first diagnosed in 1938.  There is no known cause or cure for the disease and there are no set protocols to treat the disease; and Whereas, FMD has always been considered and is still classified as a rare disease.  Many researchers now believe FMD is an under-diagnosed disease.  Some of the data suggest that four-five percent of the population may be affected by the disease; and Whereas, Ninety percent of the patients affected by FMD are women, but men and children also get the disease.  There are different classifications of FMD, the two most common types are medial fibroplasia and intimal fibroplasia.  Unlike the adult population, children tend to be diagnosed with intimal fibroplasia, which can be more aggressive.  Some patients present with both types of the disease. There is no understanding of why there are differences; and Whereas, Individuals and families affected by FMD often experience problems such as a sense of isolation, difficulty in obtaining accurate and timely diagnosis, and optimal treatment options; and Whereas, Many rare diseases are relatively well-known, but FMD is not well-known by the public or medical community.  Patients and their families must bear a large share of the burden for things such as educating others, including their own physicians, and raising funds for awareness and research; and Whereas, The Fibromuscular Dysplasia Society of America (FMDSA) was founded in March 2003. Over the past 13 years, this association has been active and successful with many programs including public and physician awareness, patient support, and engaging and working with researchers from around the world; and Whereas, FMDSA is funding the United States Registry for FMD.  Until the recent data was released, it was thought that 75 percent of FMD cases affected the renal arteries, but that is now known to be inaccurate.  It is also very common to have a five year delay from onset of symptoms to diagnosis; and Whereas, There is still much needed awareness and research of the disease.  FMD patients present with the same symptoms that much of the general population is affected with, such as hypertension, headaches, and dizziness.  Others present with transient ischemic attack or stroke, dissection (tear) of an artery, aneurysm, swooshing noise in the ear, and renal infraction.  Children can present with basic symptoms such as high blood pressure, headaches, insomnia, fatigue, and abdominal pain.   Misdiagnoses of FMD can lead to severe consequences and disability; and Whereas, FMDSA is organizing a global observance of FMD.  During the month of March each year, patients, medical professionals, and researchers, are joining together to focus attention on FMD as a public health issue during that month; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The month of March of each year is designated as Fibromuscular Dysplasia Awareness Month in the State of New Jersey to foster an awareness and understanding of Fibromuscular Dysplasia. 2.    The Governor is requested to annually issue a proclamation calling upon public officials and citizens of this State to observe Fibromuscular Dysplasia Awareness Month with appropriate activities and programs. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution designates the month of March of each year as Fibromuscular Dysplasia Awareness Month in order to promote an awareness and understanding of the disease.  Fibromuscular dysplasia, commonly referred to as FMD, is a disease that causes abnormal cellular development in the arterial wall, which can lead to the narrowing or tearing of arteries.  FMD is considered a rare disease that currently has no cure or standard protocol to treat it. The joint resolution also respectfully requests the Governor to issue an annual proclamation calling upon public officials and citizens of this State to observe the month with appropriate activities and programs.
