SINGER District 30 (Monmouth and Ocean) Co-Sponsored by: Senators Moriarty and Wimberly SYNOPSIS Permits greater diversity in creation of new health sharing ministries and establishes and exempts certain mandates and reporting requirements. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning health care sharing ministries and reporting requirements; amending and supplementing P.L.2018, c.31. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Health care sharing ministries are organizations whose members share a common set of ethical or religious beliefs and voluntarily share medical expenses among members in accordance with those beliefs. b.    Members of qualified health care sharing ministries are exempt from the required health insurance coverage in this State. c.     The term health care sharing ministry in this State is defined solely by the federal definition as incorporated under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 26 U.S.C. s.5000A et seq., which includes the requirement that a ministry, or a predecessor thereof, be in continuous operation since December 31, 1999. d.    There is no statement of intent in the Affordable Care Act explaining any benefit to a consumer or governmental entity for including the requirement that a health care sharing ministry must be in continuous operation since December 31, 1999. e.     In the years since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the term health care sharing ministry has proven unworkable as a consumer protection mechanism, with several new organizations using the predecessor loophole in the Affordable Care Acts definition to take unfair advantage of consumers in this State. f.     Therefore, to increase transparency, the law should update who health care mandates apply to and establish certain disclosures to enhance transparency. 2.    Section 2 of P.L.2018, c.31(C.54A:11-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    As used in this act: "Affordable Care Act" means the federal "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act," Pub.L.111-148, as amended by the federal "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," Pub.L.111-152, and any federal rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
