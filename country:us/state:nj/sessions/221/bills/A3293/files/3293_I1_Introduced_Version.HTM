(cf: P.L.2009, c.332, s.1) 2.    Section 23 of P.L.1975, c.180 (C.39:3-10a) is amended to read as follows: 23.  The chief administrator shall charge a fee of $100 for the restoration of any license which has been suspended or revoked by reason of the licensee's violation of any law or regulation and for the restoration of vehicle registrations that have been suspended pursuant to any law.  Upon receiving payment of the restoration fee, the chief administrator shall provide the licensee with proof of payment.  The proof of payment shall include a disclaimer notifying a licensee that license restoration is subject to payment of the restoration fee and satisfaction of any conditions ordered by the court.  The chief administrator may promulgate such regulations hereunder as [he] the chief administrator  may deem necessary. (cf: P.L.2007, c.283, s.2) 3.    Section 1 of this act shall take effect immediately and section 2 shall take effect on the first day of the second month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires certain drivers whose drivers licenses are suspended or revoked to receive notice and receipt of payment concerning license restoration, and concerns penalties for operating a vehicle while a persons license is suspended or revoked under certain circumstances. Current law provides that a person is required to act affirmatively in order to restore a suspended or revoked license by paying a restoration fee.  A person who fails to pay the restoration fee will not have their license restored.  When a driver has been issued an additional period of suspension for driving while suspended or revoked, the bill requires the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission to provide notice: (1) of the period of the additional suspension or revocation term; (2) that the driver is required to pay the restoration fee once the period of suspension or revocation has ended; and (3) that the drivers license will remain suspended or revoked until the restoration fee is paid and any additional conditions ordered by the court for restoration of the drivers license or registration are satisfied. The bill further requires the chief administrator to provide a licensee with proof of payment of the restoration fee upon receipt of the payment. The proof of payment is required to include a disclaimer notifying a licensee that license restoration is subject to payment of the restoration fee and satisfaction of any conditions ordered by the court. Current law also provides that a person operating a vehicle while the persons license is suspended or revoked may incur penalties including additional suspensions, fines, and terms of imprisonment. Under the bill, the court would not be permitted to impose a term of imprisonment, fine, or period of suspension, or revocation for a violation of driving while suspended or revoked if: (1) the original period of suspension or revocation is complete; (2) the person has no other outstanding suspensions or revocations for which the period of suspension or revocation is incomplete or the restoration fee has not been paid; (3) the person does not have any unsatisfied conditions ordered by the court for restoration of the persons drivers license or registration; and (4) the person provides proof of payment of the restoration fee. Lastly, current law provides for extended terms of imprisonment for certain violations involving the operation of a motor vehicle when a drivers license or registration is suspended or revoked.  This bill makes the imposition of an extended term discretionary in certain circumstances.

STATEMENT This bill requires certain drivers whose drivers licenses are suspended or revoked to receive notice and receipt of payment concerning license restoration, and concerns penalties for operating a vehicle while a persons license is suspended or revoked under certain circumstances. Current law provides that a person is required to act affirmatively in order to restore a suspended or revoked license by paying a restoration fee.  A person who fails to pay the restoration fee will not have their license restored.  When a driver has been issued an additional period of suspension for driving while suspended or revoked, the bill requires the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission to provide notice: (1) of the period of the additional suspension or revocation term; (2) that the driver is required to pay the restoration fee once the period of suspension or revocation has ended; and (3) that the drivers license will remain suspended or revoked until the restoration fee is paid and any additional conditions ordered by the court for restoration of the drivers license or registration are satisfied.

The proof of payment is required to include a disclaimer notifying a licensee that license restoration is subject to payment of the restoration fee and satisfaction of any conditions ordered by the court. Current law also provides that a person operating a vehicle while the persons license is suspended or revoked may incur penalties including additional suspensions, fines, and terms of imprisonment. Under the bill, the court would not be permitted to impose a term of imprisonment, fine, or period of suspension, or revocation for a violation of driving while suspended or revoked if: (1) the original period of suspension or revocation is complete; (2) the person has no other outstanding suspensions or revocations for which the period of suspension or revocation is incomplete or the restoration fee has not been paid; (3) the person does not have any unsatisfied conditions ordered by the court for restoration of the persons drivers license or registration; and (4) the person provides proof of payment of the restoration fee. Lastly, current law provides for extended terms of imprisonment for certain violations involving the operation of a motor vehicle when a drivers license or registration is suspended or revoked.  This bill makes the imposition of an extended term discretionary in certain circumstances.
