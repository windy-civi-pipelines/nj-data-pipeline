or vessel recklessly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Proof that the defendant fell
asleep while driving or was driving after having been without sleep for a
period in excess of 24 consecutive hours may give rise to an inference that the
defendant was driving recklessly.  Proof that the defendant was driving while
intoxicated in violation of R.S.39:4-50 or was operating a vessel under the
influence of alcohol or drugs in violation of section 3 of P.L.1952, c.157
(C.12:7-46) shall give rise to an inference that the defendant was driving
recklessly. Proof that the defendant was operating a hand-held wireless
telephone while driving a motor vehicle in violation of section 1 of P.L.2003,
c.310 (C.39:4-97.3) may give rise to an inference that the defendant was

P.L.1982, c.85 (C.39:5-30a et seq.), or by the court for a violation of

court.  The term of imprisonment shall include the imposition of a minimum
term.  The minimum term shall be fixed at, or between, one-third and one-half

preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was operating the auto or
vessel while under the influence of any intoxicating liquor, narcotic,
hallucinogenic or habit-producing drug, or with a blood alcohol concentration
at or above the level prescribed in R.S.39:4-50 or that the defendant was

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a presumption
of pretrial detention for a person who commits reckless vehicular homicide or
strict liability vehicular homicide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person is guilty of strict
liability vehicular homicide, a crime of the third degree, if the person
commits vehicular homicide by driving while intoxicated.  A person commits
second degree reckless vehicular homicide if the person was operating an auto
recklessly while under the influence in violation of N.J.S.A.39:4-50.  Reckless
vehicular homicide is a first degree crime if the defendant was operating the
auto in violation of N.J.S.A.39:4-50 while on school property, within 1,000
feet of school property, or driving through a school crossing under certain
circumstances. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, there is a
rebuttable presumption that a defendant who is charged with murder or a crime
that subjects the defendant to an ordinary or extended term of life
imprisonment is to be detained pending trial.  The rebuttable presumption
applies when a prosecutor makes a motion for pretrial detention, and may be
rebutted upon a showing of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, in favor
of the defendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that the
rebuttable presumption of pretrial detention also applies to defendants charged
with reckless vehicular homicide and strict liability vehicular homicide as
established pursuant to N.J.S.A.2C:11-5 and N.J.S.A.2C:11-5.3.  A defendant
charged pursuant to N.J.S.A.2C:11-5 or N.J.S.A.2C:11-5.3 would be subject to
forfeiture of the auto or vessel which was used in the commission of the
offense, unless the defendant establishes at a hearing, which may occur at the
time of sentencing, by a preponderance of the evidence that such forfeiture
would constitute a serious hardship to the family of the defendant that
outweighs the need to deter such conduct by the defendant and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill also permits
a court, if deciding against the pretrial detention of a defendant for a
violation of the reckless driving or strict liability vehicular homicide
provisions, to order the suspension or revocation of the defendants license.</p>
