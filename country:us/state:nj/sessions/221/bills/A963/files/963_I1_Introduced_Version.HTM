<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1979,
c.391 (C.18A:16-13) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    <u>a.</u>   Any local
board of education may directly or indirectly through a trust fund or otherwise
enter into contracts of group life, accidental death and dismemberment,
hospitalization, medical, surgical, major medical expense, minimum premium
insurance policy or health and accident insurance with any insurance company or
companies authorized to do business in this State, or may contract with a
nonprofit hospital service, medical service or health service corporation with
respect to the benefits which they are authorized to provide respectively. 
Such contract or contracts shall provide any one or more of such coverages for
the employees of the local board of education and may include their
dependents.  A local board of education may enter into a contract or contracts
to provide drug prescription and other health care benefits, or enter into a
contract or contracts to provide drug prescription and other health care
benefits as may be required to implement a duly executed collective
negotiations agreement, or as may be required to implement a determination by a
local board of education to provide such benefit or benefits to employees not
included in collective negotiations units.  Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to authorize coverage of dependents of an employee under a group life
insurance policy or to allow the issuance of a group life insurance policy
under which the entire premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the
insured employee.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For purposes of this section,
&quot;minimum premium insurance policy&quot; means a group insurance policy
issued by an insurer licensed to do business in this State under which the
policyholder agrees to directly fund specified claims of insureds covered under
the policy, in lieu of payment of a portion of the premium.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>b.    (1)   After the
effective date of P.L.          , c.         (pending before the Legislature as
this bill), a local board of education shall not enter into a contract under subsection
a. of this section to provide any group health care benefit plan offering
coverage that exceeds the definition of gold level, as set forth in section
1302 of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. s.18022). </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(2)   (a)   After the
effective date of P.L.        , c.        (pending before the Legislature as
this bill), a local board of education shall not enter into a contract under subsection
a. of this section to provide any group health care benefit [   plan offering
coverage to employees of the board unless the board has considered and
included, to the extent appropriate, feasible, and cost effective, as part of each
plan: wellness programs; patient-centered medical homes; reference- based
pricing; on-site medical clinics; comprehensive urgent care centers; greater
use of generic drugs and prescriptions by mail; network improvements to enhance
in-network utilization and reduce out-of-network utilization; and adjustments
to in-network deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket expense limits, and other
components, to enhance in-network utilization and reduce out-of-network
utilization.  The board of education shall also consider for each plan the
inclusion of research-proven best practices in the delivery of health care and
the optimization of a network of high-value providers.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The board of education
shall have the authority to create, modify, or terminate any plan or component,
at its sole discretion, with regard to this paragraph.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(b)   A local board of
education shall submit annually a written report to the Department of Education
describing in detail the boards consideration or inclusion, or both, of each
component set forth in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, its analysis and
conclusion on the feasibility of each component, and its analysis and
calculations on the cost effectiveness of each component.  The report shall be
submitted by the date designated by the department.  If a full and complete

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is one component of
a three-part package that is essential to ensuring New Jersey's long-term
fiscal viability.  The package will responsibly require a return to full
pension payments, cover a portion of the costs with health benefit reforms, and
create a task force to oversee implementation and resolve issues of detail. 
The viability and affordability of New Jerseys public pension and health
benefit systems are integral to the States overall fiscal condition and thus
bear strongly on other key areas of concern, from funding priorities such as
school aid, hospital aid and safety-net programs to controlling and reducing
property taxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of this bill
reflect some of the recommendations of the New Jersey Pension and Health
Benefit Study Commission set forth in its February 24, 2015 and February 11,
2016 reports.  This bill is part of an overall effort to reform and continue
high-level health care benefits for public employees and retirees and the
savings realized from these reforms would make it possible to preserve
retirement benefits and support the unfunded accrued liability of the current
retirement systems.   Specifically, the commission states that the reforms
would reduce the States health benefits spending to a sustainable level and
permit the resulting savings to be used to bolster pension funding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is intended to be
considered in conjunction with Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 190 of 2016
which proposes to amend the New Jersey Constitution to authorize the
Legislature to change pensions and health care benefits for public employees
and retirees in this State and to require the State to make its annual
contributions to those pension systems.  Therefore, this bill will take effect
four months after the approval by the voters of the constitutional amendment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill is also intended to
be considered in conjunction with a bill to establish a task force that will
develop the details needed to implement the commissions recommendations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission made
comprehensive proposals in its reports for modifications to both the pension
and health care benefits for public employees and retirees.  The commission
stated that its proposed approach is simple: reset the retirement and health
benefits that public-sector employees will receive in the future to
private-sector levels and use the resulting savings going forward to pay off
the existing pension deficit.  The commission stated that the resulting
mixture of benefit adjustments, additional funding and structural changes
offers the State its best chance to avoid the painful collapse of its public
employee benefits system.  Such is the gravity of the crisis that the status
quo is not acceptable.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission also found that
significant reduction of health benefits costs at the State and local levels
is an essential element of any effort to provide public-sector employees with
adequate, sustainable and certain retirement benefits funding.  The commission
concluded that there are no plausible solutions to closing the pension funding
gap without comprehensive benefits reform.  Without reforming health benefits
and using the savings to help pension funding, it is simply impossible to
provide adequate, sustainable and certain employee benefits funding at a cost
that the States citizens can bear.  The commission found that a
constitutional amendment as described above would make the States power to
alter benefits clear and would provide the flexibility necessary to craft a
workable, long-term solution to the current crisis.  The commission stated
that, with a constitutional amendment, the longstanding gap between [pension]
funding required and funding provided will finally be closed by reducing
funding requirements to a set schedule of payments at a sustainable level.  The
commission concluded that if benefit obligations, particularly health benefits
costs, can be reduced to a sustainable level, a constitutional amendment
should provide a mechanism to guarantee the pension funding obligations defined
in the commissions reports.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that no
health care benefits plan for public employees and retirees can exceed the gold
level as set forth in the federal The Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act (42 U.S.C. s.18022).  This limit will apply to the contracts providing
such plans entered into after the bills effective date.  According to the
commission, the gold level standard serves as a benchmark for high quality
plans in the private sector.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, all government
entities in the State will be required to consider and include, to the extent
appropriate, feasible, and cost effective, as part of each plan: wellness programs;
patient-centered medical homes; reference-based pricing; on-site medical
clinics; comprehensive urgent care centers; greater use of generic drugs and
prescriptions by mail; network improvements to enhance in-network utilization
and reduce out-of-network utilization; and adjustments to in-network
deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket expense limits, and other components, to
enhance in-network utilization and reduce out-of-network utilization.  The
government entity must consider for each plan the inclusion of research-proven
best practices in the delivery of health care and the optimization of a network
of high-value providers.  The commission states that in general the State
should follow the best practices which have evolved elsewhere to minimize costs
while providing quality health benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits the payment
of any reimbursement by a government entity for the premium for the Federal
Medicare Program to active public employees and certain future public retirees,
and their spouses.  The commission states that significant savings could be
realized system-wide by eliminating Medicare Part B reimbursement, an
anachronism dating from an era when incentives were deemed necessary to
encourage what is now near-universal enrollment in Medicare.  Not surprisingly,
private employers are increasingly declining to offer this benefit to new
retirees and are capping it or eliminating it for existing retirees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, all public
employees would be required to pay a portion of the cost of the health care
benefits coverage they receive.  The default payment would a percentage of
salary identical to those percentages required by P.L.2011, c.78.  However,
like that law, the bill allows boards of education and local units to negotiate
with employee representatives to achieve the same or greater savings to
taxpayers through an alternative to those percentages, through plan design
changes, or both.  P.L.2011, c.78 required all public employees to contribute
toward the cost of health care benefits coverage, with the same provisions
concerning negotiated alternatives, but expired after four years.  The
commission states that preserving the P.L.2011, c.78 below-average employee
contribution grid ensures public employees will continue to enjoy better than
private sector health benefits, since they will continue to make below average
premium contributions while receiving high private sector gold level health
benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill adds one additional
member to the State Health Benefits Plan Design Committee and the School
Employees Health Benefits Plan Design Committee.  The new member would be a
member of the public appointed by the Governor.  This new member will be a non-voting
member except in the event there is a tie vote, in which case the member will
be permitted to vote.  Currently, the two committees each have an even number
of members.  The commission states that the committees which by statute must
have equal labor/management membership, were created as a forum for
employer-employee collaboration.  In practice, this built-in mutual veto has
blocked reform efforts proposed by either side and has had the effect of
locking in above-Platinum-level health benefits for public employees.  Both
labor and management have expressed acute frustration with the workings of the
committees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As a result of the
implementation of this bill, local boards of education will realize savings in
their cost for providing health care benefits to their employees.  This bill
requires that those savings be applied as payments toward the cost of health
care benefits provided to the boards retired employees.  Currently, the total
cost for SEHBP health care benefits for retirees is borne by the State.  The
commissions report recommends this shift in cost and recommends that it be
limited to the extent savings are realized from the reforms in this bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires public
employees for whom health care benefits coverage in retirement is to be paid
for, in whole or in part, by the employer or a public entity other than the
employer pursuant to law or collective negotiations agreement to purchase
health care benefits coverage through a health care insurance marketplace or
exchange with the cost of the coverage to be reimbursed by the employer or
entity with such funds as may be necessary to purchase the level and extent of
health care benefits coverage the employer is committed to provide for the
retiree and the retirees dependents.  However, the coverage cannot exceed that
of a gold level plan and, for Medicareeligible retirees, the employer or
entity will provide funds sufficient to cover the cost of a Medicare advantage
prescription drug plan and the average cost of out-of-pocket expenses and
prescription drug costs of such a plan.  This provision will apply to all
current and future retirees.  The funds for the cost of coverage will be
provided through such appropriate retiree reimbursement accounts that are most
beneficial to the retiree as may be permitted by federal or State law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The public employer must
develop and initiate a plan for implementation of this requirement in
compliance with applicable federal and State law. The plan must include a
schedule for transition of all current retirees, which may be completed in
stages as may be necessary to ensure an orderly process, but is to be completed
within three years after the bills operative date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires
that the State Treasurer establish a program to provide subsidies for
out-of-pocket health care costs to active and retired public employees.  The
savings realized through the implementation of this bill will fund the
subsidies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     New Jerseys
State-administered retirement systems are collectively in a dire state of
underfunding.  There is no serious disagreement among policymakers that regular
State payments must be made in amounts as close as possible to the actuarially
required contribution until full payments can be made on a sustained basis. The
only significant disagreement is on which course of action to take in funding
those contributions: to do the responsible work of identifying how to pay for
them, or to simply create a constitutional mandate to make the contributions
without a credible plan to cover the cost.  Yet history has shown that when
State officials fail to plan for the costs they incur, the taxpayers suffer the
consequences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is part of a
comprehensive plan to take the responsible approach.  This plan is to move
health benefits for public employees closer to those that most workers for
large companies receive, and mandate that the resulting savings go towards
paying down New Jerseys pension debt.  Retirement system changes will also
ensure that pension system costs will not again balloon beyond affordability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Without such changes to public
employee benefits, it will be mathematically impossible to make full pension
payments in the short term except with extreme cuts in State services or in
priorities such as education aid, or raising taxes to a level that would pummel
the States taxpayers and stunt its economy.  The Pension and Health Benefit
Study Commission estimated that the amount of money needed would equal raising
the sales tax to 10 percent or increasing income taxes by 29 percent.  Anything
close to those levels of taxation would be clearly disastrous, wiping out jobs
and pushing even more families out of the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Those who claim that full
pension payments can be made without reforming benefits owe it to the taxpaying
public to be honest with them about how they, the taxpayers, will pay the
cost.  Responsible policymakers will show taxpayers their plan in advance,
rather than take the tragically common route of cementing a huge fiscal
obligation first, and only later sending them the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Common sense and mathematics
make clear the need for benefit reform, but confirmation also comes from the
nonpolitical agencies that assess New Jerseys finances.  Moodys Investors
Service wrote in April 2015: Without meaningful structural changes to the
states budget, such as pension reform that dramatically improves pension
affordability, the state's structural imbalance will continue to grow, and the
state's [credit] rating will continue to fall. S&amp;P Global wrote in August
2015: A positive rating action or outlook revision would require the
implementation of credible pension reform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The package of which this
measure is a part is designed to ensure the continuation of retirement and
health benefits for public employees in a fiscally responsible manner that will
protect all New Jersey residents from the calamitous results of failure to
properly address the States most serious and pressing budgetary issues.</p>
