Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.43:21-4 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43:21-4. Benefit eligibility
conditions. An unemployed individual shall be eligible to receive benefits with
respect to any week eligible only if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The individual has filed
a claim at an unemployment insurance claims office and thereafter continues to
report at an employment service office or unemployment insurance claims office,
as directed by the division in accordance with such regulations as the division
may prescribe, except that the division may, by regulation, waive or alter
either or both of the requirements of this subsection as to individuals
attached to regular jobs, and as to such other types of cases or situations
with respect to which the division finds that compliance with such requirements
would be oppressive, or would be inconsistent with the purpose of this act;
provided that no such regulation shall conflict with subsection (a) of
R.S.43:21-3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The individual has made
a claim for benefits in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of
R.S.43:21-6.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)(1)  The individual is able
to work, and is available for work, and has demonstrated to be actively seeking
work, except as hereinafter provided in this subsection or in subsection (f) of
this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The director may modify
the requirement of actively seeking work if such modification of this
requirement is warranted by economic conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   No individual, who is
otherwise eligible, shall be deemed ineligible, or unavailable for work,
because the individual is on vacation, without pay, during said week, if said
vacation is not the result of the individual's own action as distinguished from
any collective action of a collective bargaining agent or other action beyond
the individual's control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   (A)  Subject to such
limitations and conditions as the division may prescribe, an individual, who is
otherwise eligible, shall not be deemed unavailable for work or ineligible
because the individual is attending a training program approved for the
individual by the division to enhance the individual's employment opportunities
or because the individual failed or refused to accept work while attending such
program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (B)  For the purpose of this
paragraph (4), any training program shall be regarded as approved by the
division for the individual if the program and the individual meet the
following requirements:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    The training is for a
labor demand occupation and is likely to enhance the individual's marketable
skills and earning power, except that the training may be for an occupation
other than a labor demand occupation if the individual is receiving short-time
benefits pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2011, c.154 (C.43:21-20.3 et al.)
and the training is necessary to prevent a likely loss of jobs;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   The training is
provided by a competent and reliable private or public entity approved by the
Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to the provisions of
section 8 of the &quot;1992 New Jersey Employment and Workforce Development
Act,&quot; P.L.1992, c.43 (C.34:15D-8);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii)  The individual can
reasonably be expected to complete the program, either during or after the
period of benefits;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iv)  The training does not
include on the job training or other training under which the individual is
paid by an employer for work performed by the individual during the time that
the individual receives benefits; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (v)   The individual enrolls
in vocational training, remedial education or a combination of both on a
full-time basis, except that the training or education may be on a part-time
basis if the individual is receiving short-time benefits pursuant to the
provisions of P.L.2011, c.154 (C.43:21-20.3 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (C)  If the requirements of
subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (4) are met, the division shall not withhold
approval of the training program for the individual for any of the following
reasons:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    The training includes
remedial basic skills education necessary for the individual to successfully
complete the vocational component of the training;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   The training is
provided in connection with a program under which the individual may obtain a
college degree, including a post-graduate degree;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii)  The length of the
training period under the program; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iv)  The lack of a prior
guarantee of employment upon completion of the training.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (D)  For the purpose of this
paragraph (4), &quot;labor demand occupation&quot; means an occupation for
which there is or is likely to be an excess of demand over supply for
adequately trained workers, including, but not limited to, an occupation
designated as a labor demand occupation by the Center for Occupational
Employment Information pursuant to the provisions of subsection d. of section
27 of P.L.2005, c.354 (C.34:1A-86).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   An unemployed
individual, who is otherwise eligible, shall not be deemed unavailable for work
or ineligible solely by reason of the individual's attendance before a court in
response to a summons for service on a jury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   An unemployed
individual, who is otherwise eligible, shall not be deemed unavailable for work
or ineligible solely by reason of the individual's attendance at the funeral of
an immediate family member, provided that the duration of the attendance does
